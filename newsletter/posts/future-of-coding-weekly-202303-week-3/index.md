Warning: more than 2 minutes this week. However working out how to implement Async/Await as effect handlers has been a real head scratcher and here I try and walk through what I have ended up with.

We've just published our first academic paper about Clerk, in case anyone's interested:

# Thinking Together

This is an incredibly thinky group of folks. I’m wondering how, if at all, this little community has been using these LLMs and advanced chat bots. People are playing Pokemon in a text/CLI form just by asking “let’s play pokemon but with text and skip all the boring parts”*. I have to conclude that a number of you folks have made some crazy strides in the work you’ve been doing or how you’ve been refining your ideas with these tools.

Can’t believe I just found this channel after all this time in the server…been doing a bit of “building in public” on my Twitter, but it just goes into the void…but this community never fails to disappoint 🙂

Finished my rewrite of the layout & rendering engine, here's a taste of what the syntax looks & feels like:

tonight's progress: selections! almost done w/ the "normal" interactions that one would expect from an editor, and then I can move on to the more fun ones 🎉. Too often projectional editors jump straight to the tricks without providing the things that plain text gives you for free.

# Present Company

💬 [Nick Smith](https://twitter.com/NickSmit_)

[🧵 conversation](https://marianoguerra.github.io/future-of-coding-weekly/history/weekly/2023/03/W3/present-company.html#2023-03-14T02:38:58.205Z)

Are note-taking apps "too mutable"?



When I'm working on a page of notes (to develop my ideas or knowledge about a topic), I'll typically edit it for a few days, after which it tends to "congeal" into something that is too big to keep working on. My compulsion is then to refactor the page into several new pages, keeping the ideas that seem "good" and deleting or deprecating the ideas that turned out to be "bad". But refactoring my notes tends to take a fair amount of time, and I'm not sure it's worth the cost. There's a reasonable chance I will never read the notes again, because what was valuable about the note-writing was the  _ideas_  that developed in my mind  _as I was writing them_ .



The  _exercise_  had value. But the notes resulting from the exercise may not have much value.



Thus, I've begun to wonder whether I would appreciate a note-taking app that *locks you out of your old notes* . Perhaps this happens if you haven't touched a note for a few days, or maybe it happens overnight, every night.



Immutable notes aren't a new idea. Humans have been writing immutable notes ever since they started carving glyphs into stone.



Computers have given us the ability to endlessly edit a page of text. But maybe having mutable pages is detrimental, for many kinds of note-taking.



Food for thought 🤔.

 _(A shower thought after yet another morning finding and fixing bugs in my own apps.)_ 



Today some big companies can make apps with shitty logic, poor reliability and bad UX.



Today some developers can make little apps with shitty logic, poor reliability and bad UX. (Occasionally slightly better UX if they're open to designer input.)



I hope recent AI advances empower designers to build little apps with shitty logic, poor reliability and half-decent UX.

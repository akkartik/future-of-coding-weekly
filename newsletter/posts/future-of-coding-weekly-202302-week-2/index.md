With [Patrick Dubroy](https://twitter.com/dubroy) we have been working for some
months on a digital-first book "for JavaScript programmers who want to learn the
nuts and bolts of WebAssembly. You'll go from hand crafting bytecodes to
building a real compiler for a simple programming language."

On top of writing a book we are exploring what's possible if we create content
ignoring the constraints of "printing dead words".

Hey all, finally released a pretty cool (well I think so) demo of the rules
language DSL we built for fighting spam/abuse/fraud/all-the-bad-stuff at Smyte
(acquired by Twitter). It's heavily SQL-based but includes a lot of features for
working with very large teams, deploying new rules in seconds, and tracing which
rules caused an action to occur.

Demo: [websqrl.vercel.app/twitter](https://websqrl.vercel.app/twitter)

Would welcome any comments/questions. Just glad to finally get this out the door
🥳

hello everyone please enjoy my new video that I've been working on for a while
now. it's about a few different topics that might be relevant to you such as
programming, creative coding, life, art, intelligence, definitions and dead fish

Hey everyone! Really excited about this new feature we shipped today at Subset,
which allows you to jump between your different files kind of like Notion. I’ve
noticed that I have a ton of little trackers and calculators that I eventually
forget about, but every time I come across it again, it reminds me of a task I
need to do. Ultimately, it makes individual files and spreadsheets less
ephemeral. Here’s what it looks like. Next up we probably need some grouping or
favoriting system. Let me know if you have any thoughts 🙂

Jimmy and I have each read this paper a handful of times, and each time our
impressions have flip-flopped between “hate it so much” and “damn that’s good”.
There really are two sides to this one. Two reads, both fair, both worth
discussing: one of them within “the frame”, and one of them outside “the frame”.
So given that larger-than-normal surface for discursive traversal, it’s no
surprise that this episode is, just, like, intimidatingly long. This one is so,
so long, friends. See these withered muscles and pale skin? That’s how much time
I spent in Ableton Live this month. I just want to see my family.

No matter how you feel about Brooks, our thorough deconstruction down to the
nuts and bolts of this seminal classic will leave you holding a ziplock bag full
of cool air and wondering to yourself, “Wait, this is philosophy? And this is
the future we were promised? Well, I guess I’d better go program a computer now
before it’s too late and I never exist.”

For the next episode, we’re reading
[a fish wearing a bathrobe](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/papers/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf).

Sorry, it’s late and I’m sick, and I have to write something, you know?

# Devlog Together

Before and after. Does the paragraph form seem "better"? Took a surprising
amount of work, because I had to abandon the NLG being done by the reasoner and
write my own version that knows how to deal with nested terms. I'm thinking the
new one is probably better for validation, worse for debugging, but I'm not
sure.

hi everyone, I have created another canvas experiment and now I am not sure if
this is the way to go for me … maybe next time I will start with pen&paper
prototype first

# Thinking Together

Code is a weird medium. It can act directly upon the world at scale. The only
other "things" that can do that are the fundamental forces of the universe.

Code is essentially a kind of Jinn/Genie: Agency in a bottle. Jinn also
translates to
["beings that are concealed from the senses"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn#:~:text=beings%20that%20are%20concealed%20from%20the%20senses).

Invisible beings that control our world and battle for our attention. Sounds
about right 😁

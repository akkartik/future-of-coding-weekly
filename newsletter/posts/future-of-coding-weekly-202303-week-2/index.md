Re-implemented Universal or isomorphic programs.

Do y'all know of any editors with undo/redo behavior that's more interesting/granular than just scrubbing through all of the edits you've done to a file in order?

I often find my self wanting "undo the last change to *this function*" ðŸ¤”

Just came across OpenMusic, a visual programming language based on Lisp, developed for musical composition but not limited to it

a channel i follow on youtube (Creativity Labs) just released three absolutely banger prototype videos in the last hour 




* [first](https://youtu.be/2yzP70KTeJo) data visualization with a really neat linked code<->text description interface
* [second](https://youtu.be/vItfhC-5fvs) interactive programming visualizer/debugger thatâ€™s kind of like the next, more-interactive step for a lot of Bret Victorâ€™s little diagrams
* [third](https://youtu.be/apqF8_7dgbY) (ridiculously souped up logging that (in their example) hooks logs from the same place over time, associates them to elements on the page, enables filtering by call site, scope, and spatially on the page



Are they members of this slack (no idea how i found the channel otherwise)?? If so, Iâ€™d love to get in touch!

# Devlog Together

today's progress, emoji support! it mostly consisted of  `text => new Intl.Segmenter('en').segment(text).map(s => s.segment)`  in a bunch of places, so that offset calculations made sense. I also had to add a hidden  `<input/>`  onto the page instead of just harvesting  `keypress` , because emoji-pickers don't actually send valid keypresses, but they do trigger  `oninput`  in a focused  `<input/>`  ðŸŽ‰

Managed to release v1.5.0-alpha of Blawx this week, with better defeasibility features including defeated defeaters, and applicability checking. Only one major feature left to add to the language (that I am aware of): temporal reasoning.

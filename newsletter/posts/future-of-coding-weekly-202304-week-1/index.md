I’ve been playing around with hand tracking, inspired by [Bret Victor’s Future of Interaction Design article](http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign) from ages back, and it’s come together in this little toy I made, combining fluid simulation: [Magic Hands](https://magichands.forestinthetree.com/) 🙌  ([blog post](https://www.forestinthetree.com/blog/magic-hands))



Very much a starting point, but quite keen to see what else can be done with hand tracking in the browser - also keen to hear more examples of hand tracking work 🙂

Though this is an announcement of new direction for Darklang, I spend quite a bit of time looking at what AI means for programming languages [blog.darklang.com/gpt](https://blog.darklang.com/gpt/)

Hullo! Would anybody be able to look at my new website about my AI Clock and simply tell me whether it works? I’ve had a report that it is being labeled as “unsafe” and I would like to resolve this before sharing the link publicly… Thank you!

[Out of the Tar Pit](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/papers/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) is in the grand pantheon of great papers, beloved the world over, with just  _so much influence_ . The resurgence of Functional Programming over the past decade owes its very existence to the Tar Pit’s snarling takedown of mutable state, championed by Hickey & The Cloj-Co. Many a budding computational philosophizer — both of yours truly counted among them — have been led onward to the late great [Bro86](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/062) by this paper’s borrow of his  _essence_  and  _accident_ . But is the paper  _actually_  good? Like, really — is it  _that_  good? Does it hold up to the blinding light of hindsight that 2023 offers? Is this episode actually an April Fools joke, or is it a serious episode that Ivan just delayed by a few weeks because of life circumstances and his own incoherent sense of humour? I can’t tell.



Apologies in advance. Next time, we’re going back to our usual format to discuss [Intercal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL).

I’m working on a tool for text. 

This is some output but it also seems apt considering the current zeitgeist.  (Warning contains some adult content)

In his latest, it looks to me like Grant Sanderson has brushed up his Manim (animation engine), maybe just that this video features a lot of Bret Victorish sliding.

Today I got a feature request from someone in the LÖVE community and created a fork of [lines.love](http://akkartik.name/lines.html) with 2 buttons:




*  `clear`  the buffer. I imagine this like clearing an Etch-a-sketch.
*  `export`  the buffer to html. I imagine it emerging out of the app like a Polaroid.



He sent me this screenshot from his iPad ❤

This has been the most frustrating couple of weeks I have had in the 14 months or so I have been working on this project. I'm in the process of implementing event reasoning as a language feature in Blawx. But allowing users to specify events as dates has counterintuitively required me to NOT represent them as dates in the back end. Which I discovered only after half a week of dead ends. Which in turn means that I had to rewrite my date library, throwing away about a month's worth of work, and losing several features (mostly to do with using years and months as units of duration). That worked, and had some other benefits including speed, but in turn has changed where the valuable information lives in the system's responses (from the values given to variables, if any, to the constraints imposed on those values), which means that I have to rebuild significant parts of the way responses are displayed to users. Everytime I think I have solved the problem, I discover that the solution offers three new problems. It has been an emotional rollercoaster that is driving me nuts. I want to believe that the remaining problems to solve are not hiding yet bigger problems, but I have believed that before, and this has already taken three times as long as anticipated. And I haven't even gotten to the point of being able to genuinely test it. Who knows? &lt;Venting&gt;

ChatGPT (4) and DALL-E seem to be very slow atm, almost unusable. What if the demand for these services grows so fast that the semiconductor industry can't keep up? Could it be that AI won't take over the world within the next couple years as either there won't be enough computational power to run all the queries, or the prices will be hiked by a lot to balance the demand for the available computation power?

🛸 Moldable Physics & Lispy Microworlds 🏗 Structured Editing for All 🤖 Programming Language for AI

# Two Minute Week

🤖🎥 [Visual Programming for the Modern Web](https://www.flyde.dev/) via **Gabriel Grinberg**

>Flyde is a modern visual programming tool that fully integrates with your codebase

Something I've been wanting to play with for a long white!

A naive integration of OpenAI into [Flyde](https://www.flyde.dev) ✨

Too slow and far from perfect, but hey.. it works 😄

This week I got type inference back into my editor and used it to demonstrate how the first class case statements in the language work.

A different idea of what a “tool for thought” can be! This videos shows Sam’s work on  _Emmy_ , a computer algebra system ported from Sussman’s  `scmutils`  , embedded in our literate programming/moldable development environment,  _Clerk_

> Structured editing can show benefits in learnability, tool building, and editing efficiency in programming.



However, creating a usable structured editor is laborious and demanding, typically requiring tool builders to manually create or adjust editing interactions.



We present Sandblocks, a system that allows users to automatically generate structured editors for every language with a formal grammar available.



Our system's input reconciliation process acts on arbitrary syntax trees to provides consistent interactions across our generated editors.



Our editors' editing experience is designed to be familiar to users from textual editing but, compared to previous work, requires no manual annotation in the grammars.

"There it was — functional programming ex nihilo... Nobody would ever again wonder what good it was to allow functions to call themselves. And it was all so clear one could go home and build it oneself without any instruction book."

Gave an internal presentation today about color spaces, color theory, accessibility, etc.  _Wait, what does that have to do with programming?_  Well… [he teases]

Welp, I let my desire for novelty get the best of me, spent two days making cosmetic changes that weren't actually needed for anything, spent another two days digging myself out from under all the bugs I created in the process. Then I started work on the thing I should actually have been doing on Monday, and it's noon on Friday and the half-fix I have implemented has created other, worse problems than the problem I'm trying to fix. So a week has gone by, and the tool LOOKS way better, and WORKS way worse. Yay, I guess.

Been thinking about the infra needed for human-machine teaming, I think a lot of knowledge from the field of business process management can be reimagined, just with powerful natural language capabilities.






* Natural language becomes the API interface between humans and machines.
* No need to formally describe the workflow. Just talk to it and let the LLM create/modify/delete these.
* These workflows are essentially Turing-complete, distributed program where the job "processors" are people and bots. For eg: BPMN already supported branching, sequential processing, parallel processing etc.
* Open-source Zapier-equivalent systems can be a good starting point for these.

‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns over dangers of misinformation” - maybe old news, but I haven’t seen it mentioned here...

Perspective on AI from a music producer (He reminds us of Napster and concludes that networks, like Paramount+, Apple Music, Spotify, etc. will simply side-step artists and music labels altogether)

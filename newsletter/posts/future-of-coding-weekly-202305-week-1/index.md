Demonstrating a prototype of the capability permission system for mech. Anyone out here have experience implementing a system like this? Any pointers or tips?

This might be of interest to folks here: I'm working on a new book project all about computation from many different angles. Working title is "The Magic of Code" and I would welcome everyone following along and providing advice and feedback: [arbesman.substack.com/p/the-magic-of-code](https://arbesman.substack.com/p/the-magic-of-code)

We just launched a new concept of command nodes in Tana, which together with AI enables some pretty powerful workflows.

# Devlog Together

💬 [Jason Morris](https://twitter.com/RoundTableLaw)

[🧵 conversation](https://marianoguerra.github.io/future-of-coding-weekly/history/weekly/2023/05/W1/devlog-together.html#2023-04-26T16:25:23.504Z)

Finished a version with event reasoning, didn't even really have a chance to test it before realizing there is at least one more missing feature needed for my current project, namely predicates with an arity of greater than 2. Added that as a feature to the block language and the reasoner on Monday. Added it to the API for the reasoner yesterday. Today I need to implement it in the "Scenario Editor" which allows users to describe facts, run queries against those facts, and display the results. Absolutely dreading it. Wish me luck.

# Thinking Together

Is there a more modern version of ["All the Widgets - 1990"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qtd8Hc90Hw)



Grouping UI components by "type" and showing examples?

I've just asked this question "Why is bash a popular scripting language" to the wider internet [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35744867](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35744867)

I'm interested what do we think a futuristic shell environment looks like. is it a notebook replacing a shell, a different language i.e. more functional? or does a simple text script always exist

Gregory Chaitin giving a lecture on the history of computer science through the lens of philosophy and mathematics. The link should skip the intro in this video. There are many more parts, so it’s not the shortest watch, but it’s very important material that is under-taught in the standard CS curriculum.

Very nice UI ideas for extracting information during LLM-based workflows

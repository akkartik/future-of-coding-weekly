An issue will be open per week, if you want to contribute open the issue and paste a resource you think is worth sharing in the newsletter and comment on the issue of the week. 

If there's no issue for the week open one using the standard template, follow the instructions in the template and add a comment.

Use comment reactions on issue comments to upvote/downvote/whatever each submission. The reactions that have a clear sense of positive/negative will be considered to rank the submissions of the week.

If you want to propose a resource that wasn't discussed in FoC, maybe share it first there, if not, add it to the queue.md file as a Pull Request.

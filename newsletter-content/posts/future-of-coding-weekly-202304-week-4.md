When we ask questions like:






* Should we use static or dynamic types?
* Should we practice TDD?
* Should we do agile development?
* Should we use a memory safe-language?



People often say that the correct answer to all these questions is just to look at what the research shows. If research shows these things are good, then we should use them, if not, then not. In fact, this sort of response can be used to rebut almost anything we want to explore in the future of coding community. Why are we so interested in "X" if "X" hasn't been shown to be better via research? This sort of response has always bothered me. So I wrote a blog post on that question.

I just published a little app to draw graphs: [git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love](https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love)



I've wanted something like this for a long time. Intended for small graphs where laying things out by hand is not too painful, and it's nice that things don't move around every time I make a change, as happens with graphviz ([graphviz.org](https://graphviz.org)). The file format is also amenable to git; no long lines, and adding new nodes or edges doesn't reorder unrelated nodes and edges.



Immediately after sharing it, I notice that there's also a limit on the number of edges. Too many edges, and the dumb layout algorithm (connecting centroids of nodes) starts to creak.

I am back with another attempt for AST editor, now it will be more in Scratch and Haxe style,




* you have sockets
* sockets can have symbol value or another AST-node
* AST is transpiled to JS, [more languages support in the future]
* there is no baby-sitting here - you can end up with incorrect code if you are not careful

Saw a few people share snippets of Subset on Twitter so we decided to make it a lil easier by adding a screenshot feature!



The cool/fun tidbit is that when we needed to change the background color of the canvas before we took a screenshot, but thought it looked ugly. So we came up with this camera shutter effect, which masks the actual background changing it‚Äôs color to blue, screenshotting, and turning back to grey.

Hey! Someone (**@Rajath R**) asked me for any links/references to delve deeper into creative coding-y stuff.

So I updated my list of coding influences. You might find something new there (or you might not).

Someone is trying to boot Linux from a Scratch project. üòÆü§Øüòª



In fact, it's a RISC-V emulator programmed with Scratch.



Here is his journey (quoting the author):




> I actually started this project with not very much understanding of RISC-V, but after a few hours of debugging I got the hang of it. The emulator was actually based of off [github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima](https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima), which i ported to Java a while back, and from Java I ported to SCPP (A programming language I wrote) and from SCPP I ported it to here [(i.e. plain Scratch)].

Regarding SCPP:




> SCPP (Scratch C Plus Plus) [github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP](https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP)



It's really interesting to see the creativity of people that learned programming with Scratch, then start exploring new horizons to eventually come back to Scratch.

Tried this out on an iPad: [docs.circles.software](https://docs.circles.software). Not much programming or different from other visual tools. But it seems making box and wires ‚Äúgooey‚Äù goes a long way for mobile usability.

 *Befunge, but readable* 



[github.com/m-ender/hexagony](https://github.com/m-ender/hexagony) made the rounds of the internet yesterday, and caused me to swap in an old interest of mine that I've flailed ineffectually at in the past ([e.g.](https://twitter.com/akkartik/status/1238349948074070017)): a way to display a program that makes its large-scale structure really obvious (rather than obfuscating it as Befunge does).



One problem I have with Befunge (not the one you're thinking of, ha) and other  _fungeoids_  [1] is that ...

üå≥ [Permacomputing](http://permacomputing.net/) via [Konrad Hinsen](https://khinsen.net/)

One of my recent discoveries is [Permacomputing](http://permacomputing.net/) (I had encountered the term before, but never looked at it closely before). And I am wondering if anyone here has explored it more than I did, and if anyone has a view on how it might matter for the future of coding. I suspect that [Kartik Agaram](https://github.com/akkartik/mu) is aware of this because some of his projects are cited as "adjacent".



At first sight, the principles and overall objectives of permacomputing resonate with me, but I see a lot of theory and little practice. While I can see how such technology could be valuable in a different universe, which may of course be tomorrow's reality, my impression is that in the real world of today, permacomputing is nerd fiction.

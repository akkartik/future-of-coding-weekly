We have quite a FoC relevant edition of Papers We Love Education this month: we‚Äôll be discussing ‚ÄúHedy: A Gradual Language for Programming Education‚Äù with Professor Felienne Hermans! Thursday 26th at 6pm CET, all the info here: [github.com/papers-we-love/edu/discussions/11](https://github.com/papers-we-love/edu/discussions/11)

The code engine in Henosia can now interact with Chrome's own debugger, including any local variables used at the breakpoint.



It's an internal tool for now to debug the code engine. Might be useful for hybrid designers though üòÅ

Does anyone have any resources they‚Äôd recommend for learning about Rust/WASM?

Two overarching questions:






* How can we reason about notations/interfaces/editors? So that:


* We can construct correct interfaces
* We can distill what we are trying to say into more direct representations
* We can explore the consequences of what we are trying to say more directly


* How can we construct more direct analogies for computation?

A fairly complete IDE that can work directly with Excel data via LINQ, with extension capabilities of its own to boot.

# Devlog Together

üìù [Manual Tests](https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love/tree/main/item/Manual_tests.md) via [Kartik Agaram](https://github.com/akkartik/mu)

[üßµ conversation](https://marianoguerra.github.io/future-of-coding-weekly/history/weekly/2023/01/W5/devlog-together.html#2023-01-26T02:34:13.139Z)

Today I gave each app a default map for its code, so that people get a better initial experience when connecting the driver to it, rather than the blank canvas they've been faced with so far.



Initialization is one of the categories of semantics that's hard to write tests for. What should happen when a config file is present. The driver maintains separate configs for each app it knows about, so it needs to handle the very first app vs first view of a new app. What if the app has no default map. Etc., etc.



Anyways, I ended up touching [git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love/tree/main/item/Manual_tests.md](https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love/tree/main/item/Manual_tests.md) after a while.

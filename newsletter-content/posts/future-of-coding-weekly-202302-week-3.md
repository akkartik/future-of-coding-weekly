Made a code notebook for datalog queries.

As there is no plain text (or parser) does this count as another structural
editor

Inspired by re-reading Naur’s “Programming as Theory Building” I decided to make
myself a text editor to solve all my problems…

Hello everyone! 👋 I am thrilled to share the progress made with Flyde with this
community of like-minded individuals.

[Flyde](https://www.flyde.dev) is an open-source, flow-based, and visual
programming toolkit that prioritizes exceptional UX/DX and seamless integration
with existing code. The toolkit features a VSCode extension, visual debugging,
full TypeScript support, a rich standard library, and is designed to work in
tandem with existing codebases. In essence, Flyde is similar to NodeRED, but
geared towards web development.

This is the first time I am sharing Flyde with a broader community, and I
believe feedback from such a talented, inquisitive, and passionate group of
people would be invaluable to the project.

Check out the interactive playground here -
[flyde.dev/playground](https://www.flyde.dev/playground/)!

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! Additionally, a star on
GitHub would be greatly appreciated! 😊

Does anybody have any examples of version controlled projects that use visual
programming?

There's loads of good stuff in this one.

I like this kind of 'hybrid' editor direction!

[Visualize a Mastodon thread tree](https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/mastodon-unfurl.love)

Today I put together a little visualizer for Mastodon threads. The graph layout
is nothing special, but:

- it has structured keyboard shortcuts (up for parent, down for child,
  left/right for siblings) which might be more useful for understanding a
  complex thread
- as always you can live-edit it so it's hopefully easy to improve

One other little integration: opening links in browsers opens up all sorts of
cross-platform cans of worms, so I ended up just copying a URL to the clipboard
any time you click on a toot.

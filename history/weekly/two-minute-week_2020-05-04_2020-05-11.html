I may end up having a mode where you can see pins connecting things together, or even a way to modify them visually.  But for now, you are essentially correct.  Top-Left to bottom right.  It's slightly more complicated because from Oscillator1 -&gt; Filter Envelope are effectively all 'parallel', and there's a hidden node which combines them before they go into the low pass filter.  The bit of script I show at the end has the full connection details, but you might also think of this as a UI for a SuperCollider SynthDef.  In that case, you wouldn't normally see a UI at all.</p>

That includes the visual side, with the custom editor which will embed widgets for controllable parameters as you type code.</p>

Creating a complex pattern and mutating it in Tidal, before driving it through a SC synth might well produce a great piece of music, but how much does the programmer know about what the algorithm is doing to achieve the result? Visualising more of the pipeline might help produce even better results, or at least help understand how the results are formed.</p>

Beads has a very unique layout system that is slightly more advanced than the Apple struts and springs system used in XCode.  You design your layout by starting with the full screen rectangle, and subdividing it into pieces. Each chunk can be further subdivided. It has pre-programmed the commonly used types of decompositions: plain, vertical slice, horizontal slice, vertical scrolling, 2D grid, and a farily elaborate report writer for those who need to produce printed reports in the classic style. Since the layout system is in the language itself, you can use variables, IF statements, and subroutines in the layout portion, unlike CSS which hampers you great. Another huge advantage over CSS is that Beads uses explicit whitespace so placement of items is 100% predictable and repeatable, unlike CSS which on a small typo can scramble your page.  Building a complex product by gradual refinement is the methodology you use in Beads; always proceeding from a working standpoint, and adding in detail.   <a href="https://youtu.be/lhLJbC7LA2k">https://youtu.be/lhLJbC7LA2k</a></p>

Don't have layout via GUI yet, working on it now.  I am building the IDE in Beads, and it is open source and part of the SDK examples. The public has overwhelmingly expressed their desire, no expectation, for a graphical tool that generates code, so it shall be built!</p>

Am I understanding right that the nodes/arrows only show what are the inputs, and all actually calculations are specified in (textual) code?</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-05T11:54:38.212Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-05T11:54:38.212Z">2020-05-05 11:54:38</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">U0123H7JRDM: </span> <p><p>Thanks, and I'll try to explain: Each node has a property taskType which specifies the plugin which is used when the node is executed. The plugins determine the parameters that they need. The expression task which calculates the body mass index is an example of such a plugin. The whole flow is actually stored in json format as an array : both nodes and connections are stored in that array. The json is executed by code, and it is used to setup rxjs observables and trigger the attached plugins</p>

Or put in another way: What happens at the point where you have multiple arrows as input?</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-06T18:21:41.224Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-06T18:21:41.224Z">2020-05-06 18:21:41</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">U0123H7JRDM: </span> <p><p>Basically a node gets executed when it gets called via an input. A node can be triggered multiple times, so if it has 10000 inputs, it gets triggered 10000 times. At least in theory because it depends on the type of nodes and how the flow is setup, for example if the flow has conditional nodes it can happen that nodes don't trigger their output. And some nodes trigger multiple times (in the typescript implementation a node can return an observable which can trigger multiple times)</p>

I know that I would like to use it myself in production for web and apps which have complex forms which need calculations. But I probably wouldn't use this myself if I wouldn't be in control of the underlaying code and I assume that a lot of other developers who code a lot (and like to code) also think like that. "Citizen developers" could be a potential audience though. I would use it myself on application level and not so much the deep specialized code on lower levels. </p>

The editor can be easily extended with your own tasks which you can develop in your dev environment. For example if you have a frontend workflow you code the tasks in vs.code in typescript. The same can be done with backend code, I do this myself with a php project. A lot of the typescript code that I've build can already be installed via npm but I am not actively promoting or documenting that, it's there to make it easier for myself at least. But I am also a bit reluctant in putting everything online for free because I am still thinking about a business model</p>

My concerns is that this cannot grow indefinitely, parts of the flow also need to be removed from memory dynamically and loaded again when needed. Probably a flow needs to be really really big before this is a problem nowadays. Is this what you meant?</p>

<p>Really, it's not something I've <em>designed</em> in the model. It just emerges from exactly what you'd expect — a "point" is just an object with an explicit <em>position</em>, and an "edge" is just an object with a collection of points, and you can convey a point along an edge. That's all the model cares about. Everything else is just rendering, or aesthetic implementation choices.</p>

<p>• I like that you show the last computed value above the formula fields. That's a nice bit of UI.
• I love that you support units! The main other place I've seen rich unit support like that was in the calculator app Calca, but we should totally have that everywhere.
How long have you been working on this? What's the tech stack?</p>

It’s probably taken a year now. The tech stack is all JavaScript. I did an initial version using svg dom elements but it had significant performance issues. So I had to take some time to experiment and learn to code graphics and animations. Now it’s using webgl with three.js and the formulas a parsed using nearley.js . I will be checking out Calca shortly!</p>

This is a corrected version. Thanks to <strong>William Taysom</strong> for catching that.
Here is a short video showing how to build a temperature control. You proceed directly from a sketch to a final shippable product using Beads, with no prototyping necessary. A lot of wasted work happens in our industry by using wireframing tools that can't be executed. You are better off with a crude-looking working product than a fake but pretty demo. It saves time, when the final shapes are all worked out from the running product, then you apply the final polish.
 Beads is rare among languages in that it carries at runtime physical units of measurement (by creating a new datatype which carries the unit exponent array and magnitude of the value), and has pre-programmed all the common conversions, such as degrees Kelvin to degrees Centigrade, etc. In this example i also show how you can have two interlinked controls on the screen, and whichever one changes the model the other control tracks its value, all without any additional code.  <a href="https://youtu.be/JmmwmisRd2g">https://youtu.be/JmmwmisRd2g</a></p>

</p></div><div id="2020-05-10T17:31:45.315Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-10T17:31:45.315Z">2020-05-10 17:31:45</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Edward de Jong: </span> <p><p>When you are handed a big code base to learn, one of the hardest things to understand is which code is going to absorb a given event? When you have code that adds and subtracts listeners all over the place it can be very puzzling. So in Beads i made the design choice to force the author to put event tracking for each UI element right after the draw code. So each rectangular section of the screen has its draw chunk, and the tracking logic code must be put right afterwards. In the case of a mouse event, the runtime looks for the topmost overlapping rectangle, and gives the topmost handler the chance to look at the event and process it. If the tracking code returns Y the event is absorbed and disappears, but if the tracking code doesn't absorb the next chunk that handles that event gets a chance to absorb. All incoming events whether they be keystrokes, network events, synthetic events, or finger taps, are fed through a serialized event model i call the Loom. The overall goal is to allow post mortem debugging with visualization of the screen as time is run backwards.</p>

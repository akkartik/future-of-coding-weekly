Just spitballing for a minute here: I think one of the things almost everyone in this community shares is that almost none of us are not happy with the status quo. This makes for great conversation, because in many other discussion forums, it's almost impossible to break the conversation out from "how things are" to "how things could be", whereas that happens very naturally here.</p>

However, it is the basic protocols of the internet that are at fault, not how they are implemented.
In order to understand the cause of internet security bugs, you need to look at the actual bug reports, and at the code where the bug occurs. See <a href="http://cve.mitre.org">cve.mitre.org</a> and the twitter feed @CVEnew. The majority of these bugs are the result of coding in an unsafe language. When I was working in the network security industry, the unsafe language was usually C, and the bugs were buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, etc: these are vulnerabilities that would be prevented by coding in a safe language. Today, a lot of network exposed code is written in higher level languages than C, but the code continues to be full of security holes. It's not commonly understood why these higher level languages are unsafe. I'm going to arbitrarily look at today's latest CVE, which is <a href="<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12641">&lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12641</a>&gt;. This bug "allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in a configuration setting for im_convert_path or im_identify_path". The bug is a result of executing bash code, and bash is an inherently unsafe language (ie, it is not pure functional). The problem here is that you can embed "$(cmd)" sequences in any bash argument, and this will execute a command that can have arbitrary side effects. In a pure functional language, evaluating a string-valued expression <em>cannot</em> have side effects.</p>

I agree that a lot of web is already there (medium, wordpress, shopify, wix, bubble, ...), but as <strong>Konrad Hinsen</strong> said, if we want to build a tool / actual app, that is different story. That is in part due to tools/apps just inherently being more complex, that is something that we can't avoid, but there is certainly still a lot of space to make it simpler than it is right now (removing accidental complexity).</p>

Sure, Emacs is a thing, and a lot of people do a bit of customization with their shell. But the vast majority of programmers I've met and worked with, do not do this, and effectively write zero code to help with their own workflows. You can see this in the numbers by looking at the meteoric success of Visual Studio Code (arguably the most popular GUI programming tool in history), which is much harder to customize than say, Emacs, Vim, or Atom.</p>

The reason that there are so few handmade websites is twofold: One, those websites have been dwarfed by the amount of web content that's now published by people without the technical expertise to do traditional web publishing. So while traditional web publishing has not gotten more difficult, other forms of web publishing have gotten far easier.</p>

For example, you could say the same about learning new programming languages or new frameworks. But I don't find programmers particularly adverse to doing that, and they often actually find that exciting. If I were to rank programmer preference for how invest in longer-term gains, I'd put them in this order:</p>
<p>Learn a new language or framework &gt; Learn a new tool (e.g., IDE or text editor) &gt; Write code to solve their own problems</p>
<p>The first thing I'd say that ordering reveals is that branding works: languages, frameworks, and tools all have branding, while writing a script doesn't.</p>

Most people don't really care if something takes 30 steps as long as it gets done. They don't really worry about whether that could be done in one step, if they already have a way to get it done.</p>

<p>What "no code" offers is ready-made components that are easy to compose. But that can be done with (well disciplined) code and libraries all the same. The difference is that you typically have to do that composition in the midst of a lot of programming and language boilerplate / noise. But if that were cleaned up (e.g. provide a clean interface or declarative view) for the components you want, then you can have that "no code" feel on top, but still have all the power to customize and program what goes into it.</p>
<p>It's like creating a collection of functions (a library) that give you all the basic tools you need for something simple, except nothing stopping you from also writing new functions or selectively mixing some of those with your own code.</p>

<p>But except for branding, I think there is another big factor: learning is easier then creating something. While learning I read the materials, follow the instructions and play with the tech. No hard decisions, and I know I am doing something good, I am improving myself and I am following instructions, I am making myself more valuable on the job market.</p>
<p>Creating a tool / writing a script, on the other hand, means I have to make a lot of decisions (how will it work, how will I do it), I have to do research on my own without clear guidance, and finally, I don't know what the outcome will be, I might fail in building it, and I am not really sure what will the impact on my value on the job market be.</p>
<p>Not to mention that if you are working in well developed ecosystem, the "easy" tools are usually already there and present, so you feel the need to build tools less, and what is left to be done is harder and more complex, maybe so much that you don't think it can/should be solved.</p>

I definitely agree those are major factors, I'd say you're right and the career boosting potential is probably the #1 reason developers learn new languages and frameworks.</p>
<p>About "creating a tool / writing a script", I'm not really talking about projects that are the size and scope of what you're talking about. E.g., there's pretty clear progression for learning to automate:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>You might learn about Bash aliases, customizable keyboard shortcuts in an IDE/text editor, using a macro utility like Keyboard Maestro on macOS, install a shell utility like ripgrep or rupa z.</li><li>You start writing your own Bash scripts and functions, maybe write something with AppleScript or Automator on macOS.</li><li>You write your own text editor extension, browser extension, or shell program.</li></ol><p>The problems you're talking about only start to show up in #3, whereas in my experience, the majority of developers never even do #1.</p>

I actually thought that many/most devs do stuff from #1 and #2, but now that I think about it I realize my examples are from a limited circle of people and probably not representative. One thing I did notice with people I worked with is they are not using advanced keybinding system like those that emacs or especially vim offer, which I always feel is a shame since they are so fun/cool/productive, but ok, I assume that is due to the learning curve + perception that vim and emacs are old and so are the keybindings hm.</p>

I mainly avoid scripting or customization for this weird reason: it feels like tight coupling to me, which is what I try to avoid in programming and system design as well. If I use certain configuration or scripting mechanisms, it initially feels like I have much more control over the system than I have over a system that doesn’t provide these. You don’t notice that it’s an illusion until the system changes dramatically or goes away. In a way I could also describe it as “I want to use a product that has been well designed in the first place, not a mediocre system that only becomes a great one after I put the effort in to customize it.” There are things I want to be involved in building, but there are also things I just want to work without me having to make them work first.</p>
<p>That’s why I value good defaults over configurability and extendablity. I’ll rather use a product that is somewhat limited in features, if it chose good defaults over a product that is more configurable but starts with poorly chosen defaults and I have to spend time to set it up the way I want it first. I don’t know exactly where this comes from, and I know way more people — especially in our community — who value configurability more and don’t care about defaults that much. So I know I’m closer to the weird end of the spectrum — is it just me, or are there others who know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p>I’m still trying to get to the core of this weird feeling, and it still feels too hard to describe, but it seems obvious to me that it plays a large role in the platform and tool choices we make.</p>

Although I love programming/engineering and tinkering, when I need something to work, I will certainly prefer opinionated solution with good defaults then configuring stuff myself. One part is certainly the time I would need to spend on configuring, however I enjoy that sometimes - but the biggest thing is certainly maintainance! Yes, if I configured it myself, it might work exactly as I want it, but what when it stops working? And at that moment, I might not have the luxury of choosing the time when I will fix it, it might be urgent and critical. So for me, to put it simply, it is the cost of maintainance - the less I am responsible for, the more I can focus on what I want.</p>

But now I also value a lot those with good defaults. And in the end I find myself seeking configurable tools with nice defaults. For example, I use zsh as my interactive shell, with which one can configure lots of things, and I chose it for that. But after having installed it, I found the defaults was good enough for me, and I didn't have to to tweak it much.</p>

It is hard to say to which degree this goes, but I am pretty sure these is some bias there / skewed perception. I remember Haskellers discussing smth similar, about Haskell appearing harder than it is because most of the stuff discussed online is happening between senior Haskellers, so it is rather complex concepts, and if you read Reddit posts for example, you quickly get feeling you will never be productive. But, allegedly we are seeing just the top of the pyramid of Haskellers.</p>

Although I’d also argue that many end-users are not making that choice as consciously as programmers/people here do.</p>

I really like this idea (in fact, working on it :) ). Node n noodle software usually has the concept of double clicking a node to open it up, revealing its subnodes / implementation. Though zooming is a bit more natural in certain cases. I have a combination of outliner/mindmap on an infinite canvas (translation + zoom), in which a node may be expanded as a list in the outline, or exploded to the side as a mindmap/graph, or fully moved into (becoming the current ctx/workspace). When expanded in the current ctx, its nodes becomes a bit smaller, thus allowing infinite expansion on the same view, resulting in a fractal-like zoom experience. The subnodes may be static logic, or a dynamic result, and in such case, they may define their rendering to a certain degree themself, so making an actual fractal out of this wouldn't be too far off :)</p>

<p>Absolutely! For me this falls into the category of interesting opportunities in the space between 2D and 3D interfaces. It’s easy to be distracted by the possibilities of AR and VR in “true” 3D, although there is still so much more to explore in 2D (2.5D?) space.</p>

<p>Zooming is one of those interactions deeply rooted in the way we think. It has an embodied physicality to it, which provides a powerful metaphor that most people understand intuitively. This is why the touch gestures for it (pinch to zoom) are so easily remembered. </p>
<p>I’m sure there are many more ways for us to build upon the patterns (kinesthetic image schemas) that provide the underpinnings for most of our linguistic reasoning and build interfaces with them that can truly be “intuitive”.</p>

Oh my God, this Eagle Mode is so amazing. In this way you can keep so much more information in your working memory — when transitions are continuous, than in the usual way when you discretely jump between contexts (windows, files, webpages, ...). I feel like I keep everything which was shown — because nothing disappeared abruptly, just smoothly diminished so I remember where to find it.</p>

&gt; Why doesn’t everybody here use something like this every day?
is a good one. My guess as to why ZUIs are not more mainstream is that, though they can be quite effective for readers by leveraging spatial perception, they are rather difficult for makers of ZUIs. Essentially, making a ZUI is akin to cartography, but the digital world is ultimately unbounded (infinite canvas). Parent-child relationships can be mapped to containers and relative size, so something like “Eagle Mode” (which is awesome!!!) works really well since filesystems are a tree. But even then, there are many display and layout questions like the how many columns and rows per container.</p>
<p>On the application side, something like <a href="https://youtu.be/En_2T7KH6RA">Project Xanadu</a> uses a ZUI for relating documents and text to one another, but once you get to a certain number of documents, I think this seems pretty intractable as well. Spatial perception is a lot harder when the X-Y-Z dimensions are unbounded. This is just my guess though! What does everyone think?</p>

It seems to me that an object tree with circular references is a pretty nice (and scalable) structure. One giant tree can hold all your data. Any object (node) can have links to all other objects (nodes) related to it in the form of key-value pairs (object properties). You can know and use the "real/absolute address" (e.g. shortest path from the root) of a node if you want, but you as well can start from any node and go "only down" — following the links which relate a node to all other things meaningfully related to it. And so on recursively.</p>

This could be a solution: imagine you can draw an arbitrary shape on your screen and this shape becomes an independent view into your tree: you just continue zooming in this shape, and only this shape changes its zoom level, while all other shapes stay at their current zoom levels. So in this way you split your screen into several independent views, zoom each shape to a needed level so that you see all the objects you need at once, then you can select these objects at once (ctrl+click) and then do some action on them collectively.
It could also be convenient to automatically magnify (slightly resize) the area in which you are currently zooming — while other areas are still visible, just diminished slightly.</p>

"Although graphs are a strict superset of trees...", object trees with circular references are actually no less general than "general graphs" because 1) each node can relate to any other node or to a group of nodes ("children:[child1,child2,child3]"), 2) there can be multiple kinds of relations ("son: value", "daughter: value", etc.). So I cannot imagine any relation which could not be expressed with object tree structure. Object tree is a graph which just has a default convenient structure, but is not limited by it.
Please correct me if I am wrong in substence or in terminology.</p>

I’m not an expert on this, but yes I would say that an object tree is a kind of graph since you can have cycles and bi-directionality</p>

"if you have more than 1 parent"
Thanks, I forgot to consider this case.
Though I think it still can be handled with an object tree. There are two options:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>You can simply know that "child"/"son"/"daughter" relation is by its nature a multy-parent relation, so each time you see "child"/"son"/"daughter" property you should look at the referenced object and get information about reciprocal relation from there: in this case you look at "parents" property of the referenced object and get all other parents from there. Thus you got info about this multy-parent relation.</p>
</li><li><p>If you require that it should be semantically indicated that a relation is multi-parent each time you look at this relation, you can implement this with object tree through the following convention: a relation value can contain not only the referenced object, but also some meta-information about this relation besides its name:
John={name:'John', son:{multy-parent:true, referenceObject:James}}</p>
</li></ol><p>Not sure if I am correct with terminology.</p>

There are more ways to implement this, one would involve what I guess is a wrapper parent, but that dilutes the data, one would be to make a full circle with copies, but that expands the depth recursively, one would be to cross dimensions, but that is not for a normal tree. I assume you could do it in a parser by checking fi a child of a this node exists in depths above it, but that would/could get quite expensive and screwing with bloom filters for basic operations. Graphs are the different perspecive to a tree only because of the indication of whats a parent whats a child.</p>

They tried making FORTRAN auto-flowcharters, but it became what a tangle of wires. Scratch shows that you can avoid textual forms, but once programs get larger Scratch isn't so great. I do think with zooming and encapsulation of sub-areas a reasonable compromise can be reached.  I had this template. So classy, with the sleeve and all, and the legend on the back.

I think there's a good reason that <em>real</em> engineering disciplines, like mechanical or electrical engineering, use symbol-based schematic diagrams to design and document their systems. In programming, the systems we design are universally small and simple (once you take out the 99.9% accidental complexity), so we should be able to get by with doing all our coding as static 2d colorless drawings on a drafting table. We should then be able to submit those programs to a compiler or archivist labeled, of course, using colored tabs.</p>

<p>I've been struck with the nagging thought that maybe "FoC" general-purpose languages (targeting extreme accessibility) have to be designed in such a way that they can run on (modern) GPUs rather than just CPUs. Even integrated GPUs nowadays have a minimum of 200-400 general purpose cores (albeit with a slant towards certain operations). We don't really know how to use those cores effectively for general purpose tasks because we're normally trying to program them using a C dialect (e.g. via CUDA, OpenCL, GLSL...). It's the same problem we have with multicore CPUs: writing massively-parallelizable code in an imperative language is (too) challenging, and we've known for decades that we'll need to solve the problem eventually, since parallelization is the only way to scale computation once we're building circuits out of individual atoms.</p>
<p>Only languages based on constructs that are implicitly parallelizable are going to be able to target GPUs effectively whilst remaining highly accessible. The alternative is to ask the user to explicitly divide their computation up into parallelizable work units (threads/actors), which is an immediate complexity trap. Programmer-led task division doesn't scale, and it's a deep rabbit hole that can require a PhD to be done effectively.</p>
<p>Some people might argue that parallelization is a performance optimization and that most end-user apps don't need it, but I think there are many occasions where the ceiling of what's possible is just too low to offer a bright future. There are always occasions where someone comes up with a need like "I want to process this entire spreadsheet / note collection / webpage" or "I want to make a picture" or "I want to do a simulation / animation of my idea", and they want that processing to be interactive (implying instantaneous), at which point most serial languages can't handle what's being asked for.</p>
<p>So, must a new generation of accessible programming languages be based on implicitly parallelizable constructs and 400 cores? The hardware APIs we need (Vulkan, WebGPU...) are finally becoming available. We just need to utilize them half-decently.</p>

One problem we have is our languages end up expressing a lot more than we need to. E.g. sequential imperative langs specify the order of execution even when it is not necessary (and then compliers get more complicated trying to unravel the data flow to optimize). Even with parallelelizable constructs, I think we'd want to minimize the inter 'cell' communication for practical reasons.</p>

If your app is just a digital clock (incrementing a counter), then yeah, it can't be parallelized and it doesn't need to be.
Once you have a computation large enough to be worth parallelizing, then automatic parallelization depends on having the problem expressed in a form that does not introduce artificial sequentiality (i.e. avoids instruction sequences, top-down recursion, and hierarchical data structures). What these constructs should be is an open problem. I have a hunch that relational/logic languages provide a good foundation and we need some novel ideas atop that foundation. That's what I've been focusing on for the last six months. I'm hoping to be able to share more at some point, if I find a promising path.</p>

<p>Regardless, there are (imperative) languages that take advantage of the programmer specifying something as applicative, ie. “sequence of operation not important” to run them in parallel. And at the call site it looks just like your usual map over an array, just that it runs faster.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do think a functional language like Haskell is a good example to see what design questions are raised when a language restricts specifying operations where order is important in general, and only allows that with additional effort in form of monads and syntactic sugar like do-notation.</p>

• co-dfns is a data-parallel and functional dialect of APL that runs on GPUs. What blew my mind is that the compiler itself is written in co-dfns, and so you can compile your co-dfns programs into GPU code using the GPU. Prior to seeing this, I did not think that a compiler was the kind of program suitable for parallel execution on a GPU. Turns out that the choice of data structures is very important.
• Taichi is a DSL for defining fixed-height hierarchical data structures (which behave like sparse arrays). Thousands of lines of CUDA that only one guy in your organization understands can be replaced by tens of lines of taichi code. It's very instructive to look at the GPU-specific data types and compiler optimizations exposed by the Taichi language.
• TensorFlow is implemented as a library that you call from C++ or Python. Using this library, you construct what is essentially a parse tree for a program using APL-like data parallel operations. The library compiles this parse tree into GPU code and executes it. Stefan asked why this is a language issue, not a library issue. Well, it's easier to write code directly in a language, than to use a library interface that consumes source code written in another language and compiles it.</p>

The core problem at the moment is memory bandwidth and latency. Getting data in and out of gpus is slow, and gpus aren't very good at branchy workloads so you inevitably need to do some stuff on the cpu. Often the result is that actual query execution is somewhat faster but the speedup is dwarfed by the time spent fetching the data.</p>
<p>Looking at games gives a good idea of the division of work - game programmers are among the most experienced at writing gpu-friendly code but they still typically choose to put game logic, AI, pathing etc on the cpu.</p>
<p>Also modern cpus are actually pretty wide if you write code that is friendly to out-of-order execution and memory pre-fetching, but modern high-level languages go almost out of their way to be hostile to both. My bet is that designing a language to reduce false data dependencies and allow for more sequential memory access is a more viable target than designing a general purpose language for the gpu.</p>
<p>This might change though in the next decade as new gpu designs offer to share general memory with the cpu, so switching back and forth becomes more practical.</p>

• It's hard to write massively parallel code in traditional languages
• GPUs are very hard to program, especially with pre-2016 APIs
• Not all work is slow enough to benefit from extensive parallelization
• Everyone thinks CPUs are "normal" and GPUs are "special"
None of those factors imply that GPUs would be a performance <em>regression</em>, they just imply that CPUs are the easy or "good enough" path.
I mean... I've made some small video games before, and I never decided to use a CPU because a GPU <em>wouldn't work.</em> It's more that CPUs are the default choice.
On the other hand, I can see how an SQL database would be a problem on the GPU since you have to shuffle a ton of data around and disk/memory speed would limit any potential gains. I'm not personally interested in "big data" apps thankfully, so I'm happy to presume my language only works with &lt;~2 GB workloads.
And yeah, I think "the future" is integration of CPU and GPU cores such that there is no perceivable communication overhead. It might be reasonable to take that as an assumption, if helpful.</p>

<p>To a large extent I think the ball is in the hardware people's court. I remember seeing a proposal for a CPU architecture, can't remember where I saw it or what it is called... it was similar to SIMD but instead of the concept being "provide a bunch of instructions and hope developers use them" it was "run arbitrary C loops in parallel" - it was an architecture designed specifically to allow the vast majority of loops to "implicitly" run in parallel (meaning, the compiler would have to emit "vector" instructions as in standard SIMD, but the instructions themselves were more powerful than standard SIMD, enabling most loops to be automatically parallelized instead of the status quo where only a fraction of all loops can be automatically converted to SIMD form.) So, like, this needs to be a standard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the GPU side, there is a large physical distance and slow bus separating it from the CPU, as well as a separate memory pool... and GPUs are bad at running code that is serial in nature. If AMD/NVIDIA can come up with a hybrid architecture that is capable of running both parallel code and mostly-serial efficiently, then it will become possible to "just compile your code for the GPU" (or in case of JIT languages, "just flip a switch and it runs on the GPU"), and then the GPU will be a more popular target.</p>

<p>There are many projects here that consider using a DAG representation for code or logic. That's something that can be automatically parallelized (where the only blocks are dependencies). Except that each branch is probably not doing the same thing, so not SIMD.</p>
<p>Most loops can be replaced with map / reduce / filter / join / etc. (this is becoming a big thing in JavaScript, or LINQ in C#). If we keep heading that way, a lot of that stuff can be replaced with SIMD. Might not be possible wherever there are side effects, but some might be reducible to a formula?</p>
<p>For things that are sequential, maybe a model more like fields + particles, like Alan Kay has suggested before. Maybe that's actors all over again though? But maybe there's a way to make that easier to deal with than in traditional general purpose languages.</p>

The problem is that often we're operating on a small collection, and the overhead of coordinating the behavior of even two threads is not worthwhile if the collection is smaller than, I don't know, 100 elements or something. Throughout my career I've spent most of my time dealing with many <em>small</em> collections with less than 5 or 50 elements each, and when I'm dealing with medium-size collections of 100-1000 elements, it's often a hashtable, sorted list or array that I'm using as a lookup table in a bigger calculation, rather than something I'm directly using with map/filter/reduce. (I do <em>also</em> process larger lists, it's just that the fraction of code doing highly parallelizable work is small.)</p>
<p>Sometimes one can rearrange lots of small collections into big arrays to allow more parallelism, but sometimes I can't think of a way to parallelize a lot of this work, e.g. algorithms on tree structures like Loyc trees (code) don't seem parallelizable, generally, although I did design my LES language intentionally to have a "context-insensitive" syntax, so at least you can parse all your files in parallel. For these kinds of workloads I really want hardware like I described, which can parallelize short loops efficiently.</p>

Reasonable defaults / restrictions, so it is harder to hurt yourself.
On the other hand, I would be very surprised to see experienced developer that is still convinced that all those rules are untouchable -&gt; naturally, as you grow, you start testing those boundaries and reevaluating them. I think it us up to us to learn to question everything, from time to time, at least a little bit.</p>

My project doesn't have a wiki, it has a 'docs' directory. It also has an 'issues' directory, although casual users are free to create github issues. For many years, I have done 'development from anywhere' by either bringing along a laptop with a dev environment, or by ssh-ing into my main dev machine from anywhere. If github were to instantly vanish with no warning, I would be fine, and that's due to the distributed nature of git, and the fact that my dev environment contains a local copy of all my code. Github would surely benefit by turning into a walled garden with so much crucial functionality that only exists in their servers, not on your local machine, that you are locked in and cannot escape. The more it looks like Github is heading in this direction, the more that some people in the dev community will resist, create alternatives, and migrate elsewhere. My personal future of coding is decentralized. Git is an amazing decentralized tool, but more can be done.</p>

<p>Memory extending beyond a single process enables mostly just low-level bit munging. It seems to me that one mechanism for "connection over containment" (also from Stephen Kell's talk) would be rethinking what's "outside."</p>
<p>Standard "outside" today has std streams, the filesystem, the clock. But your language's objects probably don't extend beyond a single process. Your types probably don't (unless you're targeting a Lisp machine). BeOS's rich file attributes encourage you to put most of your program on the "outside."</p>

C denigrates memory less than, say, filesystems, because everything's in memory: every variable is in memory, and even the code itself is in memory, so nearly the whole program is on the "outside," and it just happens to be an annoying outside for interplay. Filesystems extend beyond a single process, but the boundary between one process and another, by way of the filesystem, is nearly absolute.</p>

At the lowest level we have electricity flying over connected wires and various interconnected micro devices <em>which are compatible</em> because they use the same voltage, etc. Just because we can connect two micro devices doesn't mean it will do any useful. Once we implement 'bytes' it becomes totally irrelevant what voltage and shape of wires is used to represent 'bytes as ram'. So you can switch out the voltage and entire circuitry with something very different and as long as you can simulate 'bytes', its still all good - because your program is dealing with 'bytes' and not 'voltage'. (In fact we have gone through many iterations in hardware from vacuum tubes). But what about bytes and <em>byte formats</em>? To me they are just like voltage - not very important to the real goal. Just because one program can 'see the bytes' of another program (analogous to just wiring up random micro devices) doesn't mean its useful. They have to agree on the byte formats. What do bytes transmit? data structures which represent <em>information</em>. So for composition between two entities, they must agree, at least partly, on the <em>shape of the information.</em> If this is possible, they could negotiate and converge on one of many possible byte representations (or perhaps forgo bytes altogether in some other future computer). Basically I'm arguing that byte formats are irrelevant and information models are where it's at, however most of our composition models are deeply coupled with irrelevant details. The entrenched bytearray orientation via Unix/C is one culprit here.</p>

The convenient thing about the "memory" concept is that your program and all its state is in memory no matter how you write it. I don't mean to minimize the importance of information design; I'm just ruminating on how it's irrelevant without access.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess this is why people like Smalltalk images so much. 😆 It's been dawning on me today that, while my usual gripe is how awful most desktop software APIs are relative to Acme's 9P interface, uniform access to all internal state by putting all internal state "outside" may be more important in the long run—with or without (ideally with!) your representation negotiation tech. Barely any web sites are extension-friendly, but they gotta use the DOM and that's where we get 'em!</p>

Caveat: I haven't used notion, and my project is a malleability project, so I'm bought in. The first two points (notifications and lack of design) actually seem like notion just isn't malleable enough. Notifications should be customizable based on the meaning of the way something is being used. Same with the graphical components. I want a sane default appearance and the ability to relayout things according to my preferences. As for the endless tweaking, I have two thoughts: it's good that people are able to customize things and explore new workflows, and it's bad that existing work isn't being discovered and repurposed. It sounds like reinvention (and some amount of incompatibility/churn) is the problem, more than the inclination to tweak things. Which is why I think any kind of malleability project should also have, like, an app store or component library, or some good way of sharing the work that has been accomplished.</p>

Or to frame it in a positive way, it'll help the public gradually learn that models are not fortune tellers, but rather tools to assist reasoning — and that the models themselves are more valuable than the individual results they produce. All people are going to gradually learn this, and that sort of societal literacy takes a long time to develop, and is not a clean and straightforward process. This is a good thing. We're going to have to go through the same process with ML, and it's going to be even messier. That's not a knock against ML or the people misusing ML. The cybernetic human is in its infancy.</p>

In fact social distancing as has been practiced has very little evidence that it affects final outcomes. This 2020  study published in nature (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58588-1">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58588-1</a>) on the Flu virus shows that viruses become so prevalent in the atmosphere that they are basically unavoidable. The fact that they  overestimated deaths in UK by more than factor of 10 is to the modelers excusable, because it spurred action. But is that responsible science?</p>
<p>My objection is that exponential functions buried inside a formula almost always result in a runaway result, and from the Club of Rome onward, people have been predicting global catastrophes from famine, seas rising, ice ages, ice melting. Soothsaying merged with the computer holding the sign saying "the end is near".</p>

<p>For example, this notation is trying to avoid creating a new standard. It's so close to x86 that you can use an existing standard.
And I can implement it with just machine code too, and the implementation can be relatively ergonomic.
Perhaps a Python-like syntax can be implemented in x86, but it feels like it would be larger and more complex.</p>

I'm a fan of libraries that support reactive updates, such as Assisticant, KnockoutJS, MobX, Vue.js and SwiftUI, but I don't know of one that contains the algorithm I want. I'll explain the problem by example. Suppose you have:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>an "observable" list of a million items, and you insert or remove an item somewhere in the list</li><li>a filtered list based on the million items showing perhaps a thousand of the items</li><li>a projection of the filtered list (map/select)
So, when you insert or remove the item, the library should efficiently (and automatically!) propagate the change through the filtered list to the projected list. If the new or removed item is filtered out anyway, propagation should stop so the projected list is not notified of a change. Ideally, change notifications should be deferred in some way so that if several changes are made to the same list item in rapid succession, the derived items (2 and 3) would only be notified once.</li></ol></p> <div id="2020-05-09T03:27:41.271Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-09T03:27:41.271Z">2020-05-09 03:27:41</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Ryan King: </span> <p><p>I’m trying to solve this exact problem right now!

A lot of the code in Excel is about handling the scale of the databases that people are throwing at Excel. The lower scale functionality is pretty easy, having written a spreadsheet before. Very important to cluster the data otherwise your CPU will almost come to a halt. This is a very tricky area that takes lots of testing to verify that your algorithm interacts well with the CPU. Since you have a very specific set of requirements you will need to roll your own; the conventional systems are not built for this kind of load.</p>

<p>Maybe that's more like PLA than a bunch of "processors", but maybe that's the goal: being able to reduce pure functional operations down to programmed logic on the hardware that's constantly updating, without all having to be cycled single-file through a CPU.</p>

<p>Lenses are like transducers, except that they are bidirectional, which is needed for David's "reactive updates". That's why I was talking about "bx" or bidirectional transformation.</p>
<p>Lenses look easy enough (I'm going to try my first implementation of them soon enough). But the requirement is for efficient bidirectional transformation of a million items. Surely that requires more thought than the usual simple Lens implementation?</p>

There are host of ergonomic decisions that are asymmetrical, and I don't believe any general system could handle a wide range of widgets. I just posted a dual simultaneous temperature control sample, where you can set the temp any of two ways, and it feeds back to the model which then automatically re-renders the widges. But you still have to manually code how you want the cursor to behave, and the scaling factors for the mouse, and how you want to clip movement. User input is rather different than rendering  a control. It is good however, to try an make things as bidirectional as possible, as it would save a ton of code.</p>

<p><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/incremental/">https://opensource.janestreet.com/incremental/</a> is also good. It can handle updates to nested collections, unlike differential, but can't easily handle maintenance of nested loops.</p>
<p>I wrote a bit about applying similar ideas to UI - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/</a> - and a friend of mine is building something in the same family for javascript/react, not sure how mature it is yet - <a href="https://datalogui.dev/">https://datalogui.dev/</a></p>
<p>I'm also working on a language that is designed to be efficiently incrementally maintained, although I haven't actually mapped it to the incremental layer yet - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/</a></p>

That seems like an additional wrinkle introduced by Doug Moen.</p>
<p>In the case of unidirectionality, you'd have some function responsible for insertion into the large list. That function also runs the filter on each newly inserted item, and if an item passes the filter, add it to the filtered list too. If you're doing this in terms of some reactive library, the library should (caveat emptor) be smart enough to not re-filter the entire list on every change, and instead just apply the filter to new items.</p>
<p>To batch together rapid updates, you'd want a debounce or a throttle —&nbsp;high likelihood your reactive library of choice has those. Otherwise, you can just roll this yourself —&nbsp;you just need <em>some</em> way to schedule code to run after a certain amount of time has passed, and a place to store some intermediate state.</p>
<p>As for recalculating the projection, mapping should be just as easy as filtering —&nbsp;just do it to each new item as it comes in. Again, all the Rx libraries I've seen are smart about this.</p>
<p>Finally, for reducing, efficiency will depend on the properties of the operation: is it associative? Commutative? Approximate? Can you build a small intermediate result that's easy to incrementally modify and recompute? Etc. This talk gives a nice summary of some good strategies: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/abstract-algebra-analytics/">https://www.infoq.com/presentations/abstract-algebra-analytics/</a></p>
<p>It's entirely possible I'm missing details that make this problem far harder than I'm imagining. But I feel like I've done this exact thing a handful of times, both with an without reactive libraries, so hopefully this helps somewhat.</p>

<p>I ran a mass in-person user study of my JavaScript debugger Theseus in the form of a class to teach JavaScript, and though I mostly remember the bugs and technical gotchas of installing my largely untested software on many stranger’s machines, it also led to incredible discussion and muuuuch better documentation, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.</p>

In that sense it might inevitably become more of a support group than a book club...</p>

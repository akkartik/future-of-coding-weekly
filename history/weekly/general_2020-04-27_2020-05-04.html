<p>It means there is no point in abstracting away from politics. Ideologies all over. One ideology has been freely expressed above: "the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities and oppression across society". I reacted calling it "group identity politics". Others have reacted too. But those reactions got deleted, and only those reactions.</p>
<p>I will elaborate: I don't even buy into the premise of "we need more women in here". Maybe I am a woman. Maybe my female partner is enjoying the conversations in here every week. Maybe my daughter is currently learning how to program and is inspired by many posts and links posted here. Or maybe not. The point being: I wish to not correlate people's identity with their gender, or to single them out in that way ("look it's a woman!"). I'm not saying gender or ethnicity or religion are not important identity holders. I'm saying that they may or may not be. People have various paths in life.</p>
<p>My ideology is that I wish to build a path toward a situation where everyone, indeed, can afford to say what I've had just said. I.e. that I can express myself without defensively adjusting for a thousand prejudices due to my gender or ethn.. wait never mind.</p>
<p>And so we get to the topic of style and tacit rules. A community has clearly a dominant style. For example, some communities like banter, others have little taste for it. There are certainly ways of talking and writing that pervade this community. The very concept of an asynchronous board is not obvious to everyone (nor is Slack). If someone (who happens to be a woman, but not necessarily) stumbles across this forum and feels uncomfortable to contribute, why would you attribute that to the community being all male? Or worse even, as has been said in another thread: a community of "comfortable white men". Why do you feel the need to bring gender into this? Or race?</p>
<p>I am sure that intentions here are good. I even believe that the author of the phrase "the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities" means well. I question however the tactics used to act on those good intentions. The first tactic is to define groups of people by gender and such, which to me utterly defeats the whole point. The second tactic is to silence whomever expresses opposition to the first tactic.</p>

I completely fail to see how actual efforts towards improving diversity would adversely affect anyone here in particular. Like, if you don't think it's a worthy goal, you don't have to participate in any real efforts (no different than any other project!). All I (and I think the CoC) would ask is to don't make statements or take actions that would discourage any group based on the diversity definitions.</p>
<p>If all you want the ability to say anything and everything, offend and put-down, make any statement without any regard to sensitivity of other folks and social groups, sorry you are not welcome here.  You can make your statements in your personal blogs or plenty of other places. In that sense this is no different than any workplace or other community (or indeed, society itself.) It's true that the boundary of what's ok and not ok isn't always clear cut - this is no different than how the law works as well. We try our best to be fair and balanced, even though it's never one-size-fits-all. This is why we have moderators and a process to report and handle incidents.</p>
<p>This connects to the Paradox of Tolerance and Popper, etc. E.g. "I'm offended by diversity and what about me and my group? How come you want to exclude us?". Well then sorry, this is not the place for you. If you're not offended by diversity but are not particularly interested in it then there's no problem, is there? Participate in all the non-diversity related discussion (which is most of the slack) and try not to sabotage the diversity efforts. If there are things that offend you, then please speak up! Either directly to the moderators or in public, as you feel comfortable.</p>

That's what this "diversity" stuff is about, at the end of the day. I think that's plenty good enough reason to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir Gordeev</strong> — You're generalizing, and sensationalizing, which makes it hard to respond to you constructively.</p>
<p>Arguing against our diversity initiatives <em>in this thread</em> is not welcome, because I started the thread to talk about the podcast and survey, and I asked for folks to take the diversity discussion back to <strong><code>#meta</code></strong>. It didn't happen. It just sucks that it looks like we don't get to have a discussion about the survey now. There are a ton of other interesting things we could learn from it.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere said something to the effect of.. further objection to the diversity initiatives is not welcome. That was a mistake on my part. Of course people need to be able to say, "Hey, this particular diversity initiative is not a good idea. I have suggestions for how we could do something better." And while I don't like it, it's not against any rules to say, "I don't think we should do diversity initiatives at all, because [for example] they'll drain resources from other initiatives, and I think that there's going to be a bigger problem if that happens." What I should have said is: There are a lot of people who are unhappy about the composition and tenor of the community, and it would be very hurtful to say that we shouldn't at least try to help them, so I will kindly ask that you not do that openly.</p>
<p><strong>Achraf Kassioui</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Gordeev</strong> — I didn't delete your comments because of politics. Please stop simply labeling things as "left-wing" and instead explain what you mean by it. The term "left-wing" is too vague and open to interpretation because of how many different ways its used in the broader world, so if you want to make your arguments carry weight, you should instead use your own words. You're also stating that things are left-wing as though that's inherently a reason to not do those things. If that's a point that you intend to make, you'll need to explain why that is.</p>
<p>So again, it's not about politics for me — I deleted Vladimir's comment because, after reflecting on it for <em>hours</em> and in my judgment as community moderator, I felt it was sexist in a way that'd cause harm. And since I was going to delete that comment, I decided to remove the other comments that had moved this thread in a hostile direction. Achraf, you characterized our interest in diversity as an <em>infection</em>. That's not against the rules, but it's absolutely mean spirited. Jack's comments were not mean spirited, so they remain.</p>

What I may do from there, if I feel up to it, is start a new thread about one of the many interesting new things I've learned about our community from the survey, like the fact that my attempt to categorize what FoC topics we are interested in was way more controversial than I expected (but like.. controversial in a good way, haha), and there's probably a lot I could learn from hearing how people would have.. you know what, I'll start that thread now.

Indeed, I believe that topology should be used first when designing a graphical language and only then one should move on to geometry. Topological features are a lot more fundamental than geometric ones, in that topology is a more basic branch of mathematics than geometry in terms of symmetries and mappings. One thing being inside another is more basic than it being smaller or larger than the other, or than one being a rectangle and the other a circle. Being connected to something is more basic than being green or yellow or being drawn with a thick line or with a thin line. I think the brain understands topological features given visually much better than it grasps geometrical ones. The mind can see easily and immediately whether things are connected or not, whether one thing encompasses another, or intersects it, etc</p>

The nested expression  f(g(h(j(k)))) can be represented in some notations as a sequence of chained operations like j(k) | h | g | f, so what was inside becomes a linear flow. Conceptually you are taking the output of a subprocedure and sending onwards to another subprocedure. Is this topology or geometry? in the classic sense of the words neither. And if some of these processes operate in parallel, then how do you notate that? Mathematics which is thousands of years old evolved from single values and calculations, and a notation that matched that, and there is very little in math history to help us when we encounter synchronized parallel processes. Really its a new offshoot of discrete math we are exploring here, and a new notation needs to be invented, because all the unicode symbols that we already have are fairly useless! I know i sifted through the 1000 of them, hoping to find some good stuff, but they mostly render poorly because typographically the graphic artists not knowing any math, designed them to be the same EM width as regular letters, making them mostly useless. Don't get me started on the problems with TeX.</p>
<p>The inability of the regular structures of the past, most notably the n-tuple and the matrix, were insufficiently general for my needs, hence the graph database inside Beads language, which subsumes n-tuples, matrices, and also eliminates the relational database, which i loathe.</p>

State transition diagrams as shown in the Harel notes are actually much harder to understand than some purely textual finite state transition syntaxes.  The more wires you have the worse the graphical form evolves into a hairball. That's why dependency charts of programs are often useless; above a certain crosslink percentage you get a hairball again, which provides near zero insights beyond the fact that you have made a mess of your program.</p>
<p>I studied many abstract mathematics branches hoping to find some great unused branch, and unfortunately what i found is that Mathematicians in general are so unconcerned with practical things that they go off into outer space, and often spend their time proving that all X is Y, or that there are only 3 solutions to Z, or that if A is true then B cannot be true, or that there are an infinite number of solutions to things. Existence, counting, classifying are their main preoccupations, and in computer programming we know what we want to do exists, and the count is based on the user input data, and classifying things gets us not much, so the intersection with pure mathematics is surprisingly weak.</p>

Bad DX may make more things difficult and so make feature requests seem harder.</p>
<p>But the more urgent part for me: bad DX can stunt potential collaborators in the 'user' stage of development for a tool. Then you get feature requests like, "can you add a preference for this so that I don't have to put up with your crappy build+install process to modify it for myself?" which further complicate the codebase.</p>
<p>The eco-system for Vim (and probably other text editors) shows this problem so much. You start out with a text editor that's easy to build. As it gets harder to build you get rc (settings) files, then turing-complete rc files, then plugin architectures for rc files, then plugins for plugins. And all this time people are getting increasingly discouraged from just hacking on the editor to learn how to help themselves in ways others may not have anticipated. Here's a concrete example: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/103994830568601931">https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/103994830568601931</a></p>

This question, "What FoC topics interest you most?" was my attempt at it, and it was a bit of a disaster!</p>
<p>I think it would be exhausting to list <em>all</em> our possible interests, but grouping some them together also seems to have caused issues. The more we lean on the fill-in answers, the less we'll be able to identify shared interests because the way we describe them will be different. If we let people select as many answers as they want, we'll have a harder time visualizing the result set because we have to decide how to weight each selection. But if we limit the number of selections, Duncan gets really mad, and (sigh) rightfully so.</p>
<p>I hope it's clear what I was interested in learning from this, but I think I bungled the execution. It'd be super interesting to hear how <em>you</em> would go able trying to structure this question. How would you build a survey that attempted to figure out what our most <em>central</em> interests were, and to what degree we were interested in those things? The things to maximize are: how much can we learn, and how efficiently and painlessly can we collect that data from people?</p>

Nintendo as you all know is the most consistently high quality, successful game company on the planet, and inside those games each level is carefully graduated as to have no serious bumps, so that one progressively gets harder tasks but the slope of the increase is almost imperceptible.  A highly effective method. In the area of paper books, the mathematics series called "Keys to Algebra" from Key Curriculum Press Berkeley (owned by Springer) is a fantastic series. There are other subjects covered in Math as well from that series.</p>

I’m building a gui builder, and I’m trying to figure out what the interface should be between parent and child components to allow for maximum flexibility of layouts while still having things mostly just work when they get combined. I’ve been taking inspiration from the existing gui toolkits (html/css, QT, GTK, WinForms), and from more fanciful gui designs (the iron man interfaces, rainmeter skins). I’m trying to understand what tradeoffs are being made in these systems in a holistic way. Like, what layouts are expressible. I would like to generalize away from are the heavy focus on rectilinearity. Things I’ve been imagining are force-based layout algorithms, and some sort of path-based deformation/matching between child and parent, but they’re just thoughts for now. Has anybody come across any literature on these sorts of topics? The only thing I’ve come across is constraint-solvers.</p>

<p>I haven't, so what I've pivoted toward is "make the tools really good, so it's easy to design a nice layout" rather than "make the layout happen automagically".</p>
<p>Not sure if you'd find this framing helpful, but it might help you narrow what sort of research is relevant. To me, a force-directed layout is appropriate for something like data-viz, where you can be a little loosey-goosey about where things end up. In a GUI, you generally care a lot more about getting a result that <em>feels good</em> in a way that's hard to encode algorithmically.</p>

Will definitely take a look at those. I guess the thing that’s leading my thinking in a more automatic direction is I’m picturing an ecosystem and sort of appstore of components.

There are just a few people in hollywood who know how to make those things. They are mixture of 3D and 2D animations, always using glowing lines and very few colors so it looks terrific. But as a user interface it would be horrible because all the buttons look alike, and the font sizes are microscopic. So although they are sexy from a distance, if you had one in front of you, it would be confusing, hard to use. A lot of music software is enraptured with sub-6pt fonts, and microscopic icons. So i would be wary of chasing Hollywood's ideas.  Remember Star Trek next generation, with their buttonless screens that would be sure to create carpal tunnel syndrome in record time? A lot of the futuristic stuff is unergonomic, and possibly harmful to the human body, and presumes a magical artificial intelligence that just graduated from CalArts and spent 1000 hours making a screen that appears in the movie for 2 minutes. A 100 million motion picture is a time compression device, where 50,000 man hours go into making something that lasts 2, so a 25,000 : 1 ratio there. By all means see what you can come up with, but don't hold yourself to unattainable graphic standards that are the work of genius graphic designers who are at the top of a very specialized field (i.e. fake UI's for futuristic films). Hollywood has a long history of faking the future; Irwin Allen was a famous TV producer who loved banks of flashing lights and nutty rubber monsters. I think you are better off studying from the great masters of the Renaissance, who used proportions to draw everything, and also the great book "Designing for people" by Henry Dreyfuss, the greatest industrial designer in the history of the world. Everyone who does any design work should know that man's output because he was so great. He didn't do computer interfaces, but he had a systematic way of attacking every problem that resulted in an optimal final design. It is his methodology that is still useful today.</p>

This is the kind of outside-the-box thinking I was looking for (pun-intended). I’m not sure. I think containers are inherent, but maybe a model where a container is just a set of constraints over some children with no graphical presence itself would be possible. This deserves more thought.
You don’t know who is in charge: the container or the content.
This is very much the issue I’m running into. I keep thinking of these fairly naive systems where its either parent-driven or child-driven, or possibly there is a point in the tree where it switches, but I don’t know how to rectify them into something consistent and intuitive. I guess that’s why constraint-layout is a thing.
<strong>Edward de Jong</strong> Great points. I think there’s an element of me being suckered into thinking these interfaces would be more useful than they really would be (and I will definitely be reading Designing For People). Part of my goal, though, is to just avoid baking in too many assumptions about what makes for a useful/ergonomic/good UI. Which is perhaps itself naive.
great design comes from building something over and over again
Absolutely. Part of my goal with this system is for things to get forked and redesigned and reshared by end users over and over again. I think even a great designer can’t anticipate an individual’s idiosyncracies as well as the individual can tweak and reshape something to fit their own brain.</p>

I understand the sentiment but dismissing automatic layout seems wrong. In a database analogy, would be like doing away with SQL and performing all queries programmatically with lower level API calls and for loops. Makes me think there must be a different way to layout graphics that is to CSS as Datalog is to SQL 🙂</p>

One of the things that baffles me about this, is that I find the job of a programmer in many ways easier than being a designer. For one, your definition of success is more straightforward (does your program work?), but I also just find searching for solutions to problems to just be easier for programming. E.g., I'd take searching for a solution to a programming problem on Stackoverflow over trying to figure out how to do something in Adobe Illustrator any day of the week. In other words, I also generally find the technical minutiae of being a programmer easier than being a designer. So it's confusing to me that programmer's are paid so much more.</p>

I think a lot of people use spreadsheets, but I have no sense of the relative proportions.  For data work, "end" users are also working with text-based coding (often in notebooks) and some well made GUI tools. I haven't used all the products below, but all of them have happy users:
• For wrangling rectangles of data: Pandas in Python, dplyr in R (my personal favorite)  and SQL, and GUI tools like Alteryx and Trifacta.
• For data visualization: Javascript/R/Python all have increasingly powerful and easy-ish to use options for viz, there are chart chooser tools like DataWrapper and Flourish, and GUI tools with sophisticated grammars of graphics like Tableau.</p>

• Most users never write a formula and are still fantastically productive with spreadsheets.
There’s some overlap here, but the fact that a system has a powerful component that doesn’t get used isn’t necessarily a failure of that system, even in a context where we think providing that power is good. What I think would constitute a serious criticism of spreadsheet software is users occasionally try to write a formula, but get confused and frustrated and give up.</p>

<p>Right, and that might be appropriate for your problem, but I’m suggesting that evaluation/code may not be needed for many/most of the tools which would allow people to do the things they are currently hiring programmers to do.</p>
<p>That is, the range of the things people typically want to make may be small enough for them to build from a well abstracted set of primitives in a no code way.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dekorte</strong> We're making the same point, I think. Excel is an "Oh, code" tool. So is Factorio. So is Zapier. These are things that don't look like "programming", but it turns out you use them to build dynamic, logical systems. You're doing programming, there's still evaluation, but it's an experience that's been designed for <em>you</em>, not for <em>programmers</em> (eww).</p>
<p>My beef with "no code" (well, one of my beefs) is that many of these tools are just... frustratingly superficial non-textual programming environments. Given that the distinction between "coding" and "programming" colloquially is basically nil, it feels like "non-fat" all over again —&nbsp;sure, you've removed the text-code, but you've substituted it with something much worse! What you really want is ~good fat~ a full &amp; rich programming environment, but created for non-programmers.</p>

<p>Lots of room for thinking about how language design affects the ability to customize software without the anticipation of the original developer. Eg emacs lisp allows redefining functions without having to fork the original library. Eg languages with private/public settings that are enforced by the compiler completely prevent that kind of reuse/rediting, forcing the user to fork which is a pretty heavy-weight operation.</p>
</p> <div id="2020-05-01T00:06:40.379Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-01T00:06:40.379Z">2020-05-01 00:06:40</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Kartik Agaram: </span> <p><p>I don't follow why public/private prevent 'rediting' (nice coinage there). Isn't it just a simple edit to change 'private' to 'public'?</p>
<p>Redefining functions that weren't really designed to be extended is just as much a reason to fork as anything else, because you often want to reuse some part of the body of the function. It becomes a game of Russian Roulette if you start updating the library without updating your copy of the redefined function. So the leap from editing copies of things to editing things in place isn't that big, I think.</p>
<p>The key here is to make forking a lightweight operation. And version control systems have already done a lot of heavy lifting for us by refining the erstwhile-heavyweight operation of branching into something light and inexpensive. I suspect making forking lightweight is mostly just a switch in mindset. There are no chains here except those we place on ourselves.</p>

Been a long day 😄
don't follow why public/private prevent 'rediting'
The distinction I was getting at is editing something "from the outside" vs having to fork. Eg if there is a function in a libary whose behavior I want to change in...
• ...Julia, then I define a new method of that function in my code
• ...Rust, then I search for the repo, checkout the correct version as a git submodule, change the Cargo entry to point at my local repo, edit the code in the repo, then rebase my changes when I want to upgrade the library
The end result is that same - I've changed some logic and I have to maintain that diff. But in the latter case there is a <em>lot</em> more busywork involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making forking more lightweight would definitely help, but I think there is an additional point of friction in maintaining the diff as text vs maintaining the diff as a language mechanism. Eg if the code gets moved around a bunch in the file then rebasing the diff is painful, whereas nothing has to change with the override. Also version control and package managers don't play together very well at the moment. If the original version of the package gets updated the rust package manager won't even warn me about it, let alone help me rebase my changes.</p>
<p>I think we're agreeing in principle - we both want forking to be a lightweight mechanism. You could come at this from either end - a version control system that understands the language and helps you manage forks, or a language with built-in mechanisms for composing code with changes.</p>

But the idea with layers is to emphasize convenience and rely on the programmer to preserve composability-related properties. In other words, you can easily make changes to a function that create arbitrarily-difficult-to-debug holes for yourself. I rely on the people using layers to use them tastefully.</p>
<p>I think this is an irreducible trade-off. If you want extending functions to always be nice and safe, you'll be restricted in the number of places the safe mechanism is available to you.</p>
<p>In my current project I instead focus on catching any possible breakage in the project using some combination of tests, types and correct-by-construction design. This is the <em>top</em> priority, and I give up as much as possible while preserving it. Now others can modify functions all they want, safe in the knowledge that <em>something</em> will complain if they break something when forking a function.</p>

To me this is the lethal problem with packages: by making them easy to consume we make them harder to modify. And that seems like a hard, black-or-white, us-vs-them trade-off. And if that's right, if there's no place for compromise here, I prefer keeping it easy to modify.

<p>Same goes for binary distributions of anything. Always keep source along for the ride, have the binary rebuild automatically if the source ever changes. Anything else makes the world a worse place, IMO. (I've been feeling a lot more strongly about this in the past couple of months.)</p>

&gt; I feel very cynical/fatalistic about Emacs/Lisp/Smalltalk lately. Yes, the core design choices exhibit a high trust for users. But then it seems to be inevitable that the layers on top start chipping away at this trust. Vim's package managers introduce hurdles for anyone who wants to modify sources. (See my recent war story.) How does the Emacs eco-system compare? Is it really common for people to modify packages? Racket's raco feels the same, additional complexity between me and the libraries they want me to ‘use'.
&gt; 
(Responding here since I don't have a lobsters account)
When I first started using emacs I had the same thought, since it's really hard to override a package with the default package manager <code>package.el</code>, but there is actually a quite sane package manager that makes modifying packages trivial, <code>straight.el</code>, it's based on the nix/guix model, but it's even simpler—to edit a package, you just edit the files in the git checkout it creates, that's it. maintaining your own branch is as simple as... making a git branch, and so on. Recently I had a problem when I upgraded my packages, and to switch to an older version, I just checked an older version of the package from git, and the package manager handled rebuilding and everything automatically. It felt very nice.
In a way, it's like the package manager uses git metadata as its database, so you don't need extra cruft on top.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>User modifications in computer games are a lot more common than other software types and are even possible in some big budget proprietary software. I think this can offer some insight into how this can work for other software.
The most basic version is to move all content/assets (3d models, textures, sound files, etc.) into its own subfolder tree and give it clear human readable names. Users can then simply swap out files.
The next level is to abstract how the metadata for high level objects that use these assets is stored out to a text based format like json or xml so that the assets can be reused and new high level objects defined.
This can be extended to more and more engine content, including defining behaviours and simple functions in json/xml</p>

Now that I look for it I start seeing it everywhere, for example as far as I can tell, this chain is possible: Open an After Effects project, add a Cinema 4D 3D model to it via a plugin, then open a Houdini project in Cinema 4D via a another plugin, then render it all via a third-party renderer like Redshift. Now I'm not sure if all of that would actually work, but it's fascinating how flexible the workflows for professional creative apps are, especially compared to consumer software. Like compare that to just trying to get something like Apple Notes to talk to Excel...</p>

And CPUs do insanely complex things with scheduling, memories and caches.</p>
<p>I would LOVE a good, modern (abstract) CPU emulator that could execute a Wasm program and show me what was happening with scheduling and caches. People have tried this kind of stuff before but I don't know of any nice tools. I've been thinking I will have to make my own (simplistic) simulator at some point if I'm ever going to make a "great" compiler. Otherwise I'll just be applying/benchmarking heuristics "black box"-style and hoping they work well.</p>

<p>It would have many layers, each layers one concept, and it would show just one concept at a time, but in a zoomable map. It would start by showing the highest level layer - a game running.
Then it would zoom in super fast until it reaches the lowest layer - how registers and caches work. Now the user has to go through every layer until they reach the highest layer again.
All layers are explained visually.</p>
<p>From how the CPU executes instructions, to how it fetches them from registers, to caches, to how the MESI protocol works to keep caches coherent, to how data is fetched from RAM when it isn't in the cache and how slow this is, to how  data needs to be fetched from disk, how the CPU feeds data to the GPU, to how all of these systems intertwine together through buses. From this level we should have a pretty good architectural view of how all the systems work together at a low level.</p>
<p>From here we zoom out into a higher level to driver land and then to OS land and to how a runtime works to load a PE/ELF into memory. Then we go on to show what is inside an executable and how the data got there - from assembler to compiling and linking to tokenizing and parsing to actual code.
At this point there should be a good view of how code actually gets executed.</p>
<p>Then we zoom out again to show how code is structured into platform independent layers to abstract networking protocols, file systems, multi-threading, etc. Then how this is used to build core systems for memory allocation, maths, debugging and profiling, etc. Then on to resource systems for textures, materials, 3D models, etc, to the low level renderer where the rendering commands are being dispatched, how data is fetched from the different resources to achieve this. On to the above layers of scene graph management, animation, post processing, HUD, and finally gameplay.</p>
<p>This gets us all the way back to the highest layer where the game is running. From this point forward the user is free to go to any layer and play around with some parameters to see how the layers above and below are affected.</p>

<p>I have written a few NES emulators myself (one in CL, one in Reason) with a goal of tracing the running application and visualizing it in a useful way … but they are nowhere near finished 🙃</p>
<p>Still, I think the notion of using runtime tracing to build-up a CFG for a game or ROM and allowing the user to inspect the graph/code rather than just sprites or nametables as most emulators do is promising.</p>

• apps are user-friendly (usable, concrete, visual) but limit functionality, aren't composable
• software libraries are programmer-friendly (composable, abstract, syntactic)
The dream is: unlimited access to functionality, usably and composably. How?
• Unix pipes are a composable text-mode UI, but we lose the GUI.
• A Tangible Value is a typed value (model) paired with a GUI (view, controller). GUIs are composable whenever their underlying values are composable: eg unix-like pipelines, function composition.

He is giving design principles for composable GUIs. An algebra of GUIs. There is hard work remaining to design a general purpose GUI framework based on these principles. Or consider the GUI primitives in your system, and think about whether they could be redesigned for composability.</p>

But Conor is asking us to think about a new topic: semantic composability. When you compose two "meanings" (denotations, values), a new GUI is generated for viewing/editing/invoking this composite meaning.</p>

Tangible Functional Values is not about GUI-building. It’s about value/product/output creation. The aim is to make the programming experience tangible and more approachable for non-linear thinkers. The non-composability of Unix pipes is one of the motives for the work—instead of the (untyped) single-output-single-input of pipes, Tangible Functional Values lets any (type-compatible) output feed into any (type-compatible) input. More importantly, this isn’t accomplished by a nodes-and-wires interface, but by a manipulable display of the values (the output), i.e. a display of “what you have”. So you feel like you are manipulating the things rather than the computation. Conal’s goal wasn’t to create a usable system, but to reduce this idea to its core elements, and he did so admirably. Centering values/outputs in the programming experience is moderately rare in FoC systems (and is perhaps a key feature of spreadsheets!). I like to call this mode of programming “value-centric” (as opposed to algorithm-centric or AST-centric). Of the value-centric programming systems I’m aware of, Conal’s is always the example I think of first because of its elegant simplicity (even if it is missing a few features to make it practical!).</p>

In graphical interactive software you have a lot of state, lots of widgets, and management of 500 things on the screen at the same time becomes a major chore. Even the portfolio management system i worked on in FORTRAN back in the day on mainframes did batch processing that included a fair amount of state as we were always accumulating numbers into buckets for sorting and categorizing purposes. None of the projects i have worked on would be convenient at all inside a data centric world. I understand Doug's art generation language would benefit from this, but i consider this area a very specialized niche.</p>
<p>I think of a spreadsheet as a poor-man's database. It is fundamentally a 3.5 dimension system; you have a 2D sheet, which you can break into sub-rectangles, so i call that 2.5 dimensions, and the 3rd dimension is the array of named sheets you can have. As long as your data can fit into that dimensionality it works okay; especially since MS beefed up Excel to support about a million rows. But showing the data and hiding all the formulas makes most spreadsheets unauditable  black magic systems, and really quite dangerous. It is a well known thing in business consulting to find out that some part of a company's fundamental processes have been automated via Excel. There is no question in my mind that a very robust data editor coupled with a graph database could give  Excel a run for its money, but going up against the MS machine is an expensive process. Just like IBM they use the F.U.D. technique for suppressing competition.</p>

But fully understand why people stay in Excel, because the current popular programming stack, HTML/CSS/JS/Frameworks is more than 10x the effort to learn.</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-02T12:28:47.414Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-02T12:28:47.414Z">2020-05-02 12:28:47</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Doug Moen: </span> <p><p><strong>Edward de Jong</strong> Imperative programming (and shared mutable state) was a reasonable idea in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, when programs were small, processors had a single core, and internet-related security holes were not a concern. But imperative programming doesn't scale. The legacy of imperative and shared-mutable-state programming is responsible for our current software crisis. The future of coding is pure functional programming and immutable values.</p>
<p>Large programs with shared mutable state can't be fully understood or debugged. This problem becomes much worse with multiple cores. The imperative programming community's response to multi-core programming was mutable state shared between threads and processor cores, guarded by mutexes. This is a catastrophically bad programming model. You can't understand or debug the code. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state.</p>
<p>Imperative programming doesn't scale to large numbers of cores--mutual exclusion mechanisms steal most of your performance. The solution is to eliminate shared mutable state. Machine learning with TensorFlow is an important example of massively multi-core programming. What makes it possible is that TensorFlow is a pure functional language. Unfortunately it has to be embedded in Python, because we don't have a mainstream pure functional language yet.</p>
<p>As an aside, I find it tragic that my personal computer has a 1000 cores (most in the GPU), and most of these cores must remain idle because my system software and apps are written in weak, stone age imperative languages that don't provide a simple and efficient way to distribute computation across a huge number of cores.</p>
<p>Imperative programming is a catastrophy for software security. In the imperative model, any function call can change any state in the entire system. This is the root cause of most security flaws. A sort function can encrypt all your files, display a ransom message, and phone home to an internet malware server. And we are seeing these kinds of exploits in supply chain attacks on open source software repositories. Pure functional programming puts security first: functions cannot have side effects, and functions have no access to data that isn't passed as an argument. The type system can trivially guarantee that a sort function will not intentionally spawn a bitcoin miner, or accidently corrupt shared mutable state outside of the array that you are sorting. A common response to the inherent insecurity of imperative code is sandboxing. It's a backwards approach. What if architects built buildings out of contact-sensitive explosive materials, then attempted to mitigate the resulting safety issues using a complex system of nested blast barriers. Imperative programming is inherently insecure, and pure functional programming is the answer.</p>

However, it is the basic protocols of the internet that are at fault, not how they are implemented. It is a fact that the early internet had zero concern with security, given that it ran on private leased lines between the universities.  I remember visiting MIT at the dawn of the internet, and there was a terminal hooked between boston and berkeley. You could chat back and forth; it was fairly useless until the WWW came along.</p>
<p>You are perhaps not familiar with Modula-2 which was Prof. Wirth's 10 year later sequel to Pascal. In Modula-2 you can specify whether or not a called function has access to modify data, and along with other clever and simple features you can make rock solid programs that are as tight as it can be. And to claim that pure functional program is the answer to anything is not factual. If you are building a Chess game program, the state of the board is going to change, and any attempt to evade changing the state of the board is merely hiding the state changes somewhere. Minimizing the number of state variables, and making sure there is no redundancy (which is the source of many errors) is a virtue, but to pursue utter purity in avoiding state makes your program unable to do any useful work. John Backus who invented FP, who gave a lecture i attended in 1973 on his Functional language called Red at the time, was unable to finish his work, and his prior creation FORTRAN did battle with COBOL (and losing to an inferior language). He had the goal of interchangeable parts, but did not achieve it.</p>
<p>There is little evidence that FP is bringing about an era of interchangable parts, and making it easier to maintain large programs, two of the most important unsolved problems in computer engineering. My own project revolves around using deduction, something nearly forgotten as it was last seen in the 70's in PROLOG. Since all programs must eventually map their syntax into the underlying instructions of the Intel or ARM processors, the only difference between 2 languages can be the convenience, conciseness, shareability, and maintainability of the notation. There are languages like FORTH that trade everything for brevity, but nobody programs in FORTH because it is unmaintainable. The ability to share components in the FP languages I have seen is not exemplary. The idiocy of having millions of programmers reinvent the same programs over and over is quite absurd. Look at Google's code pile; they must be close to 10 billion lines, it is ridiculous. I can't recall a time when i found some nice chunk of code on Github and was able to use it. There are billions of lines there, but it is all disorganized, full of dependencies i don't want to carry, and of unknown quality and reliability. So to ensure things work i end up writing almost everything myself. People like me are part of the problem, but i don't have access to a marketplace of nice little widgets like Apple's iTunes App Store has for full apps. That would be a really useful thing.</p>

I’m excited for what is being explored in Swift and Rust (and C++).</p>

Swift used to be a pretty modest language, but is turning into a monster. Apple is pursuing a strategy of constant enhancement to the language perhaps so as to indirectly block Swift from stabilizing and becoming an Android platform language.  Not that there was much danger, because a great deal of the language is dictated by the Cocoa underpinnings of OSX API sets. At least it has a very tight spec; the old ObjectiveC language that Jobs used at NextStep lacked a manual, and the spec was "whatever the compiler does". I wonder what the author of Swift will come up with next; not being tethered to OSX would give you a lot of freedom.</p>

But you have to be a domain expert to judge how robust any given quoted result actually is. In highly visible domains, which epidemiology has suddenly become, there are always people who oversell unreliable small-scale findings to the public, and others who criticize robust results with superficial arguments. Science works best when politics doesn‚Äôt care about its outcomes.</p>

<p>Ease of reading is a major objective of my Beads project, and i feel that it has been achieved.

The statement that "<em>for thirteen years, taxpayer funding from the MRC went to Ferguson and his team, and all it produced was code..."</em> is very wrong. Computational scientists all around the world still struggle to get funding for software development. Public research funding is attributed for producing research papers, not software. And people who invest too much time on software development don't get jobs in academia. And that's a big part of the problem. Decision makers in public research have only very recently begun to understand that code is both and important tool for doing science and an important output of research. And I hope that the story of this model will help to accelerate this process.</p>

<p>I heard an interview with Miller on another podcast (linked in the show notes), which focussed on the history of Max and Pd and the arc of his career. He dropped a few kernels of design-related ideas that went unexplored, so I decided to bring Miller on our show and have him go in-depth. We talked about the design of Max's scheduler (vs other kinds of realtime scheduling available in the early 80s), how he arrived at the visual "patcher" interface, why Pd looks and feels so spartan compared to Max, to what extent the patcher interface is actually <em>visual</em> as opposed to just a fancier CLI, and other notions that'd be interesting to folks designing their own live/visual programming environments.</p>
<p>This episode is the shortest, tightest interview I've done yet. I'm also slowly dialling-in the sonic identity that I'd like the show to have. Not there yet, but getting closer.</p>
<p>Enjoy! And please help spread the word about the show if you have a good way to do so.</p>

<p>Well, it is something I felt a lot, when doing some patch for Max4Live to simply process OSC information, which was a frustrating experience with visual Max/MSP. At that time I actually was able to do that using JavaScript because MaxMSP allows to do that, which was way easier, even if you had to edit your JavaScript code in an external editor, which is unnecessary complicated.</p>
<p>It is this experience of complicated way to combine visual and text programming that makes me want to explore some programming environment that mixes the two, which eventually led me to work on my zed editor project 6 years ago. I hope I will find some time to post some TMW videos about it (ü§ûü§û ).</p>

<p>I guess he would agree that it doesn't need to be a text language. I think that this is an important point: box'n arrows are very expressive for some kind of programming tasks but for others we must look for some other visual representations that are more expressive.</p>

&gt; It seems to me like he doesn't actually much care for visual design. Thus, the distaste for bevels and drop shadows, seeing those things as superfluous eye candy rather than tools that designers can use to create meaning.
Yes, I agree and PureData would have been better with some a bit use of visual effects, to improve readability. In that space Max/MSP did a good work, and I generally find that Max/MSP patches are more "readable" than PureData ones, with their mere black on white look with no contrast at all.</p>
<p>I also find that the interview shows that, on the contrary, he actually cares about visual design. He only choose to stick to this very simple and basic visual design but I guess it is very consistent for him. But I agree it would be better if he had stop a bit farer in the "raw &lt;-&gt; eye candy" scale! üôÇ</p>
<p>I have also heard that one of the reason he doesn't want to redesign with visual "effects" is to not break existing patches that "rely" on the old look. I guess something like, if you add thicker borders and inner padding for blocks, the 2D arrangement might change and some patches can become less readable.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>He built the patcher as a tool for non-programmers. My whole philosophy is: build a visual tool for expert programmers, where "programmer" is more of a way of thinking than a particular skillset.
I totally agree with this philosophy!! 100% of it. In fact it is that kind of idea that makes me want to work on FoC and start my experiments (ok, now, I <em>must</em> find the time to make a TMW video to present this üïêüïëüïíüïì...). It was first because block and arrow coding was a pain for some "simple" programing task I know I can manage quickly with text programming.</p>
<p>So his inclination to reach for text and an imperative paradigm feels like a blind spot ‚Äî and an unexpected one, considering he basically defined how most people conceive of visual programming.
At least, the take away of this for me is that he agrees that block and arrow programming with PureData is not efficient for some programming tasks. And that something is missing.</p>
<p>To me, that's terrifying. We might have been better off if Max and Pd hadn't existed, and visual programming had instead been popularized by someone with a knack for visual communication.
Yes maybe. But as we all know there is a huuuge load of visual programming environments, trying lots of way to convey "programming" meaning. With very few that are still useful/used, even some with great visual communication. In that space, for me Max/MSP and PureData are apart, they are (and especially Max) some programming environments that lots of non expert programmers are using to build things that are useful to them. They are succesful in that, because there is something in them that "works" and this success is an inspiration for me.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon Progressive WebAssembly Apps (PWAAs) yesterday and thought that they might be of interest for members of this group. It's basically just combining Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and WebAssembly. The main selling points:
‚Ä¢ Cross-Platform (runs in every modern browser)
‚Ä¢ Native feel (mobile system ui integration, add to home screen, offline functionality, ...)
‚Ä¢ Installation as easy as bookmarking a website
‚Ä¢ Near-native performance using WASM
For me, this feels like it could become the go-to solution for cross-platform apps. I'll probably write a Todo-PWAA (I need a replacement for Wunderlist anyway :P) to test this approach.</p>

Both localStorage and IndexedDB have very low size caps (typically ~50mb) and are subject to random deletion whenever the browser feels like it.</p>
<p>Also the IndexedDB api isn't great for building a decent query language on top eg transactions are already hardcoded in, every method is asynchronous, there isn't a proper seek method.</p>
<p>Overall I get the impression that PWA are still very much built around an online-first model where all your data lives on a server somewhere but you might cache stuff for the occasions where you're offline for a few minutes. It doesn't seem feasible to produce a good offline-first experience on the web today.</p>

For what I'm planning to build, 50mb shouldn't be a problem, but I can see that this would be limiting in other cases (e.g. music app). Regarding persistence / durability, one could argue that smartphones and tablets aren't the right devices for persistent and durable storage anyway. The get dropped, drowned or stolen which makes storing data on them only a bad idea. My current thoughts are that an "end-user home server" and devices connected to it might be the best solution. This would allow for backup, synchronization, availability and scalability of stored data without giving it into the hands of who-knows-whom. But that's another discussion ;-)
Back to the point: I could imagine that we'll be able to use <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> within PWAs some day. If I remember correctly, this could allow fine-grained file system access for apps which should fix the current storage problems.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p> one could argue that smartphones and tablets aren't the right devices for persistent and durable storage anyway.
The idea of offline-first apps is that they are completely capable without a network connection, and just use the network for backup / collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Email is a perfect example - with native clients I can search and write emails offline and then sync up when I'm back online, even though the canonical copy of my inbox lives on a server somewhere. Web-based email never seemed to deliver a decent offline experience.</p>
<p>A side-effect of building stuff in this way is that offline-first apps typically load faster (because the data is already here), are more responsive (don't have to wait for a network roundtrip to eg autocomplete an email address) and are easier for the user to extend/compose (because all the data and code exists locally already).</p>
<p>The future I'm hoping for is we keep the ease-of-distribution of the web but allow building offline-first apps that are actually able to use the full capabilities of the machine. My phone has a 128gb drive. I send/receive ~0.3gb of email per year. Keeping a synced copy really shouldn't be a problem.</p>

But on the practical side, cutting down on existing stuff is pretty hard. Who would decide what to keep and what to do with all existing projects using some tech you'd like to get rid of? In theory, I'm totally with you (together with probably most web devs) in theory, but achieving practical improvements is the real challenge here. I Hope that WASM/WASI will be the kind of restart we all want, but let's see.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the web isn't the only platform suffering from growing complexity. I guess that if I wanted to write a native Android app, it wouldn't be much easier than using web tech. The only thing would be that I had to write like 5 other apps for the other major platforms and deal with all the little differences between them. Compared to that, a single web app that can be installed on all platforms and works consistently sounds pretty interesting.</p>

I'm a huge fan of offline-first web apps. My last comment didn't mean to argue against that, I just wanted to say that random deletion of data by the browser shouldn't cause data loss. So in the email-example, if the browser deleted data it could be restored from the email-server. This may be inconvenient, but not a big problem. And as long as there's plenty of storage available, why should the browser free up memory? I can kind of understand that browsers won't guarantee to keep the data forever. Extending PWAs to allow unlimited data storage and have some form of UI to check data usage of each PWA would be great.</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-15T21:37:32.425Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-15T21:37:32.425Z">2020-05-15 21:37:32</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Jamie Brandon: </span> <p><blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p> if the browser deleted data it could be restored from the email-server
Only if the server has already synced that data. Otherwise it just deleted some emails that were queued waiting to be sent and undid all the changes to my inbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even if there is no data loss, deleting the data assumes that I'm almost always online and that it's only stored locally as an optimization. I have this problem in practice with eg spotify which occasionally clears all downloaded music for some reason, usually just as we're about to drive into the mountains and out of cell phone coverage. Or when I'm abroad and don't have mobile data.</p>
<p>There was a proposal to allow tagging browser data as persistent so that it won't be deleted by the browser without asking the user first - that would be big improvement if it lands. But I still expect the APIs in general to be built around an online-first model of the world.</p>

It's not just inconvenient, it's a symptom of an architecture that is based around turning my multi-thousand-dollar supercomputer into a dumb client for an overloaded vps somewhere on the other side of the world and on the other side of a spotty cell connection. Not because it produces a better experience - aside from the ease of distribution most web apps provide dramatically worse UX than the native apps of the 20th century - but because it's more profitable to own the users data. So it really bugs me to see that model becoming not just prevalent but invisible, to the point that people design api's for offline usage that are not usable by someone who is regularly offline.</p>

You see it in the Atom editor, with the shrunken form of the document on the right. It is used extensively in Fancade, which because it is based on a Isometric projection of 3D space, is quite natural. All graphic design products use zooming constantly. The reason you don't see it used that much in programming is that once you zoom text below 6 pt it is illegible, and therefore useless. Seeing the shape of code does not inform you in any way as to the function of the code. Unlike a bitmap which can be sampled to 1/16th of its pixels and still be quite legible, code basically turns to mush when shrunken. Looking at a blobby bunch of wires may be sexy at first glance, but without comprehension it is mere graphical artifice with no substance or actual productive value. I don't find the Atom shrunken text form on the right is much better than a scrollbar.</p>
<p>Zooming does preserve context better than jumping, and i think we will see more of it, but don't pin your hopes on a UI trick going to advance programming significantly.</p>

For moving a viewport across a large 2D canvas, I prefer a UI that lets you pan in 2D using mouse movements. Like Google Maps, for example. Using two separate X and Y scrollbars to move around is clumsy by comparison. If I want to visualize where my viewport is in 2D space, I prefer a 2D map of the entire canvas that shows my current viewport position, rather than 2 separate X and Y scroll bars. If you add zooming to this (a Z axis), then again I like the Google Maps UI where you use the mouse scroll wheel or the trackpad scroll gesture to zoom in and out, in preference to a Z axis scroll bar. This is what I've mostly implemented in my Curv project.</p>
<p>Curv is missing a "time scrollbar" for rewinding an animation, but I think this is a good idea. It works well in the viewer for Youtube videos.</p>

<p>Do you agree that college and grad school are the best way to learn?
I think that traditional education system is "below what is actually needed"; there are some fundamental flaws in a system where other people decide for you what you should learn and how (they have neither knowledge nor incentives to decide what is best for you). I understand that we need to stand on the shoulders of giants and not reinvent the wheel all the time, but this is just a challenge of a non-coercive education system, and it is solvable. I think the best solution for education lies in this space, and we should look for / invent it here. We should raise the quality of learning collaboration to much higher level, we should seek mentors and thought leaders like Alan Kay and take their advice and recommendations, but it should be up to us learners to decide what to do with this advice.</p>

On the other hand, if you stay in the same university and group throughout undergraduate and graduate school you might also become a bit blind to other perspectives and other ways of doing things.</p>

I generally consider TextMate (released 2004) as the starting point of an era of text editors built around extensions. That for example makes Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code all "TextMate-likes" in that their built around significant amount of functionality coming from share-able extensions. (Note that I'm making a distinction between <em>extensible text editors</em>, √† la Emacs, and <em>text editor extensions</em> that are easily share-able packages/plugins/bundles, etc...)</p>
<p>Other note-able milestones in the text-editor-extension era are the introduction of Pathogen.vim for Vim in 2008 and Package.el added to Emacs 24 in 2011. Light Table and Atom, released in 2012 and 2014 respectively, are also notable as the first popular web-based text editor built around extensions. Being web-based greatly increased the ease of writing extensions that involve GUI elements.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear about what others consider important milestones for extensions in text editors? For example, I'd love to hear more about any prior art to TextMate? Before package managers for Vim and Emacs, how did people share syntax highlighting files? And were there examples in other text editors that went beyond syntax highlighting, e.g., did any text editors prior to 2004 have a plugin system that could do more than just add syntax highlighting, like adding commands?</p>

Some people asked about the layout system, here is a 2 minute video showing why you want to design things using proportions rather than pixels. Screen densities vary from 100 to 500 dpi nowadays, so you can't ever use pixels and expect it to look nice across all devices.

In this video i show a tool i just built that lets you visualize your output as if it was on different devices. This tool is in the Beads SDK example set called "cycler". The way it works is interesting; you compile two programs at once; one is the "monitor" program that gets control of the screen, and then runs a slave program inside a smaller window. Javascript has iFrames and so on, but doesn't really have the concept of a dpi inside a window, which is a huge hindrance. Anyway i hope you find it interesting.Â Â <https://youtu.be/AoACdQSSsZM>

Couple of minor questions, Edward:

1. Is the cycler tool in your current release? I didn't immediately spot it.

2. Did you mean to post this to **`#two-minute-week`**?

I am interested in layout issues such as these; good stuff ðŸ™‚

i got flak for posting in 2 minute week too frequently, so it is here instead. I will be releasing 0.125 probably today which includes the cycler. It is already in the Github repo though.

that looks really cool

I've been thinking about this kind of UI too


> *[2020-04-30 03:00:00]* **Emmanuel Oga**:

apps always seem to run behind when they want to implement aria support for screen readers


> *[2020-04-30 03:00:24]* **Emmanuel Oga**:

so I was thinking it would be good to make apps the other way: first make them work with voice, then add the graphic UI

few related things on my mind: <https://blog.repl.it/clui> seems related, sans the conversational part


> *[2020-04-30 03:02:20]* **Emmanuel Oga**:

that video shows a python framework to specify the interactions.  I suspect there may be inspiration to be hold from text adventure languages

The [Repl.it](http://Repl.it) CLUI article is very much the basics of what a CLUI could be, itâ€™s barely scratching the surface actually. Most CLIâ€™s already have these features built in these days. Nonetheless, the article touches on important concepts that I fully believe and leading a company to do just that ðŸ™‚

<p>It's called SchÃ©ma, it's a visual programming tool combining Block and Node based approaches with focus on direct manipulation, instant feedback of each step in the processing, smooth ux and versatility, even though the first focus of it was light control (DMX, LEDs).</p>
<p>It's developed from the ground up in the VL visual programming language. </p>
<p>I'd love if you tried it out and tell me what you're enjoying, what not and what you can imagine doing with such a tool â˜º</p>

What are your plans for the future of Schema, a paid tool or is it going to be open source?</p>

Currently I'm heading in the licensing direction of vvvv, the environment I made it in. Which is a fairly benevolent free for personal, educational and trial usage and commercial use (which in this case could be for instance a club or higher budgeted event using it as their main light controlling tool) requires a license, likely monthly but I'm still working that out.</p>
<p>At the same time I would love for the whole thing or at least parts of it to be open source, so people can learn from it and modify as they see fit. So I'm at a bit of a crossroads (for a while), thinking how to have it as open as possible while being able to sustain the development without having to rely on projects using it coming my way. I hope for the Patreon to become a substantial part of that equation but it's still very early days.</p>

What about the terminology used in Schema, like Fixture, Director, Controller, were you inspired by other tools or is it mostly something you came up with?</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-17T14:00:38.203Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-17T14:00:38.203Z">2020-05-17 14:00:38</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">U013GB24BD4: </span> <p><p>Fixture comes from lighting, given the versatility I was considering changing this to Agent or Actor however. This might still happen. </p>
<p>Actor would also play well with the film terminology of Director, which is called like that due to its function of commanding others. Now that I return to this topic in my mind I remember that I was also toying with Screenplay for some function in the early days, not sure if for Director or something higher level.</p>
<p>However the plan is to have every Actor being able to tell others what to do as well. Either globally like the Director, spatially based (eg. Actors up to 2 meters) or through other queries. This would again be done by assigning behaviors or sending messages which would then be handled by the behavior of the target Actor.</p>
<p>I had something like this running in one installation I did with XYZ project and it was quite powerful. In a way it would introduce this state machine on steroids into SchÃ©ma.</p>
<p>After this change the main difference between Actors and Director will probably be just that one is placed in the scene (on stage) and the other is not. But then why not have them come in and out and have the hierarchy completely flat, with extra capabilities added via some sort of modifier system. </p>
<p>I also had the concept of multiple directors to split responsibilities, which would come back with this.</p>
<p>Controller, that I guess comes from MIDI controllers so that one was pretty natural.</p>

Block Stack less so, even might be contraintuitive to programmers, but I feel like that's what it looks like and Patch or Program is too techy and not like what it looks like ðŸ˜…</p>

The way you interact with them probably partially from Resolume.</p>

The program was originally supposed to be called BeeHive/Hive/bHive and the individual atomic behaviors Bees, as little individual workers pulling a common rope in a way. This actually still remains in parts of the code, eg the IBee interface which is used for behaviors. Given that these names were taken, my uncertainty about the idea and me having a little epiphany after drawing some device schematic I went with SchÃ©ma in the end. I know it isn't super unique in the world of computers, given XML Schema or the Scheme programming language, but I felt like it really fits the idea and that hopefully the long Ã© (which is how you write the word in my native Czech) and later putting it under the scenic.tools umbrella would differentiate it enough.</p>
<p>Although the Ã© is usually omitted in most communications as people lack Ã© on their keyboards ðŸ˜€</p>

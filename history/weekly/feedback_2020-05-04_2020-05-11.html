Who would've thought! This is an introduction to Loyc trees and LES which I've been working on for a few years.

<p>...or something like the language Whitespace, which ignores all non-whitespace characters and assigns meaning to spaces, tabs, and linefeeds.</p>
<p>...or perhaps a language where the syntax will have different meaning depending on context. For instance, where a construct like <code>if</code> can be an expression in some contexts and a statement in others.</p>

</p></div><div id="2020-05-08T14:46:27.186Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-08T14:46:27.186Z">2020-05-08 14:46:27</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">David Piepgrass: </span> <p><p>If you're parsing a language that has features that aren't available in any popular languages, feel free to choose your own representation. I just looked up APL and it appears that many of its features are available in more popular languages, with names that are less terse. No one would be able to guess that</p>
<p><code>(~R‚àäR‚àò.√óR)/R‚Üê1‚ÜìŒπR</code>
Computes which numbers from 2 to R are prime.
<code>X[‚çãX+.‚â†' ';]</code>
Sorts a word list stored in matrix X according to word length.</p>
<p>So I would recommend renaming APL operators internally using names inspired by Python, Julia and MATLAB, but this is just a suggestion; how you use Loyc trees is up to you.</p>
<p>It is expected that some names will have a different meaning depending on context, e.g. most languages have overloaded functions, but it has become clear to me that processing Loyc trees is easier when their meaning is not ambiguous. For example, I now use a different form for "tuples" and "lists of things that are internal to a construct". A tuple is written <code>(a, b, c)</code> in LES which means <code>`'tuple</code>(a, b, c)<code> while a list internal to a construct is conventionally denoted </code>#(a, b, c)<code>, e.g. </code>#fn(T, Square!T, #(#var(T, x)), x*x)<code> marks its argument list with </code>#<code> and represents the function </code>T Square&lt;T&gt;(T x) =&gt; x * x`.</p>

By the way, <code>x</code> is a <code>Symbol</code> object in my implementation and while there is a global symbol called <code>x</code> and <code>'+</code>, you can also define other symbols called <code>x</code> and <code>'+</code> so that they could refer to a specific variable and a specific version of the operator. Maybe this says more about <code>Symbol</code> than it does about Loyc trees, but I thought I'd mention it because hiding extra information via the symbol object seems useful.</p>

Note that another important facet that helps people understand the logic behind the rules is the meta group, which is similar to the meta channel here.</p>

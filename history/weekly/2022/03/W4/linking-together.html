<p>Teaser:</p>
<p>There are two kinds of tools: user-friendly tools, and physics-friendly tools.</p>
<p>Physics-friendly tools force you to grow in a specific disciplined way, while user-friendly tools save you the trouble of a specific kind of growth and discipline.</p>
<p>Whether you use the saved effort to grow somewhere else, or merely grow lazier, is up to you. Most people choose a little of both, and grow more leisured, and we call this empowerment.</p>
<p>Physics-friendly tools feel like real tools, and never let you forget that they exist. But if you grow good enough at wielding them, they allow you to forget that you exist.</p>
<p>User-friendly tools feel like alert servants, and never let you forget that you exist. If you grow good enough at wielding them, they allow you to forget that they exist.</p>
<p>When a tool allows you to completely forget that you exist, we call it mastery. When it allows you to completely forget the tool exists, we call it luxury.</p>
<p>(Alright, I'm going to quote the whole thing at this rate. Skip to end.)</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s fundamental-limit phenomenology around minimum-viable tooling. A machine that flies has to have a certain minimal complexity, and building one will take tooling of a corresponding level of minimal complexity.</p>
<p>Periodically, there is a bout of enthusiasm in the technology world for getting past the current limits of minimum-viable tooling, and so you get somewhat faddish movements like the no-code/low-code.. Premature user-friendliness is the root of all toolchain jankiness.. Simpler, more user-friendly tooling is the result of improved understanding, not increased concern for human comfort and convenience.</p>

I can't say I like his labels very much, but his three dimensions look very useful. I have seen the physics/user-friendly axis alluded to many times, but never with an explicit label or a good discussion. The "praxis" and "poiesis" axes look relevant for systems design: you want high-poiesis tools for building complex systems, but high-praxis tools to connect them. I don't see why a tool couldn't cover both, but I can't think of any that does.</p>

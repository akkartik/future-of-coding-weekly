<p>For instance, if you want to turn something off and on, you could use:</p>
<ul><li>An "On" button that turns into an "Off" button, like a toggle or checkbox</li><li>Two separate buttons (perhaps segmented), like a radio selector, or a select / pulldown with 2 options</li><li>A button that you need to press and hold for "On" which reverts to "Off" when released, or the same but on hover rather than on press</li><li>A box / region that you drag some other object into for "On", and drag it back out for "Off"</li><li>A button that will "latch" into the "On" state when clicked, which requires a complicated procedure of clicking many other buttons to release the latch and turn it off</li></ul><p>The first three examples are fairly simple / obvious, and are thus ubiquitous. There are probably other simple / obvious approaches, but probably not many, because the interaction here is really, really simple ‚Äî it's a binary off / on. Looking at the real world, it's hard to find examples of a binary off / on control that aren't basically the same as the top 3 bullets. And when they are different, it's usually through some additional elaboration that serves some other purpose than "make it simple / obvious to turn the thing off / on", much like the last 2 bullets.</p>

These standards lack texture, but at least they don't impose a new learning curve, they don't reveal new accessibility problems, etc.</p>

The 2D GUI is pretty well-explored at this point. 3D GUIs are almost as old, and not as fully explored, but we still see an increasing degree of stability there (ie: look at in-world GUI elements in games and game engines, like beacons/markers, paths, brushes. Also look at the common in-viewport GUI elements in 3D apps, like surface normals, TRS-manipulators, the way verts/edges/faces are depicted, etc.)</p>
<p>We haven't explored VR nearly enough to reach consensus. Likewise, voice interfaces. Likewise, tangible dynamic media (Dynamicland, Reactable, etc). So if these new paradigms continue to grow and expand in usage, we'll probably eventually see a standard set of interface conventions emerge for them.</p>

<p>This came up while working on an Obsidian plugin to replace the built-in ‚Äúgraph view‚Äù. One of the design constraints was that it handles different scales appropriately, from deterministic approaches at small scales -&gt; physically simulated at medium scales -&gt; probabilistic/heuristic at large scales.</p>
<p>I didn't want there to be any modes and I wanted there to be consistent observed behaviour, so I started referring to this as ‚Äúpixel-perfect handoff‚Äù.</p>
<p>It's made me wonder what else there is to explore here. Imagine interface systems that are able to switch backends without you noticing; tools that can be ‚Äúdragged‚Äù into other software which appear to continue uninterrupted; data transformations switching to faster approaches when the context allows.</p>
<p>What other examples might there be? Where else could this idea go? What infrastructure could be developed? Is this just another lens on interoperability, or something else?</p>

IMO there‚Äôs a bigger discussion here around how rarely design + UX is factored in when general protocols are designed &amp; agreed upon. In some ways, it‚Äôs hard (e.g. the email protocol was designed in a day and age where the GUI wasn‚Äôt really a thing / key factor).</p>
<p>As a tangent ‚Äî in my day job, I work to support a popular open source project that has a large GUI footprint (that‚Äôs also open source) and unsurprisingly the discussions around what to change are driven primarily by engineers oriented towards implementation details. Designers aren‚Äôt usually empowered to participate in the open source change management process and many engineers don‚Äôt have design skills of their own (it‚Äôs a deep separate skill / field so no surprise there!).</p>

For instance trying to generate a map with a broad outline of terrain, plains here and mountains there, perhaps going into detail on a specific mountain pass that must be just so for your story to work, but leaving the rest up to the generator. That midpoint displacement algorithm or whatever that drives your mountains needs to plan to meet up with your finely specified terrain even while it's still roughing out where the peaks are going to go. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_fractal_mountain.gif"></a><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_fractal_mountain.gif">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_fractal_mountain.gif</a></p>

<p>We always discuss what kind of digital UIs would make programming simpler and more intuitive, so I was wondering if someone has looking into new kind of hardware I/O which would change how we program today.

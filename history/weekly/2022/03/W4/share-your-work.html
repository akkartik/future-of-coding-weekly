<p>It has been programmed entirely within Observable. Production traffic is routed through the developers notebook if you have it open, so you can observe the system live. I exploit observables dataflow so each step of the processing pipeline is cached, so you can see exactly where a problem occurred, and thanks to hot code reload, you can fix a bug and have the pipeline continue without rerunning prior steps allowing easy iterative programming workflows. Of course, because Observable notebooks are executing Javascript, you can attach a debugger too (even programmatically)</p>

<p>This is what I think the future of software development should look like. But I am struggling to communicate this well. The idea is to make cloud programming feel local, to exclusively test in prod, because when you are hitting third party APIs its a waste of effort mocking a staging environment, or a local environment. I want to remove the thick layers of indirection in the development process that no longer make sense. Forget git, forget toolchains, just straight to prod using modern Javascript, debugged with the authoritative debuggers built into browsers.</p>

How would a large team work together without stepping on each other's toes? How would folks keep track of features, merge branches, research where exactly a bug got introduced, etc etc etc? Git is such a perfect tool for the job in so many of these cases, so I'm not sure how one would get rid of it.</p>

Git is great, but its overkill (how many people stop working when Github is down, in practice, we don't use it like Linus needed it to be) and its kind of a workflow distraction (ok! now I need to think of a commit message).</p>
<p>If we cut (Github in particular) out we have eliminated a whole load of extraneous development complexity and distraction.</p>
<p>Nobody spontaneously follows a git workflow, you have to be trained, it's unnatural. We just need a get out of jail command for mistakes (rollbacks) and merging for working with others. Version control should work as background feature to a realtime process</p>

In my team, devs from all over the world working in a variety of languages and platforms all know Git. It's something they share, a language we all speak. We occasionally use Github, but we are definitely not dependent on it. In our projects, we see a lot of benefit from leaving detailed and clear commit messages. It helps a lot when doing forensic analysis.</p>
<p>In any case, I love what you've done here re: Observable development; love the vision! :thumbsup_all:</p>

Maybe this is an interesting use case: end2end API testing. I have cronjobs that ping notebooks, that can login and test secure APIs against unit tests (<a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/testing"></a><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/testing">https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/testing</a>). By writing a test you pretty well specify everything a commit message would and the reactive nature of the notebooks are really good for iterating on like API authentication. WDYT?</p>

While the app is feature complete, I want to do more work on the literate programming aspect and add more explanation to the code. So maybe it's a bit hard to read ATM, feel free to leave comments in the notebook and I will expand on confusing bits. You need an OpenAI API key and a Google Cloud Service Account Key to get it fully working locally.</p>

For me, one of the main takeaways is that it‚Äôs possible to have many aspects of programming supported by a ‚Äúlive executing‚Äù toolchain. I.e. you don‚Äôt need complicated build / deploy setups, and exploring how far we can take this imo could open the doors to make programming more accessible to a wider audience</p>

<p>I thought this was good advice for understanding most software projects. In particular, interacting with the material by making changes to the source as way to verify (and build experience with) the code.</p>

<p>It discusses the distinction between visual syntax and visual semantics and how visual syntax tends to be misused or underused in visual notations like UML. Great read, definitely one I‚Äôll likely be referencing for a bit!</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.</p>

<blockquote><p>In this paper, I am trying to lay out a new form of computation, which focuses on the harmony reached in a system. This type of computation in some way resembles certain recent results in chaos theory and complexity theory. However, the orientation of harmony-seeking computation is toward a kind of computation which finds harmonious configurations, and so helps to create things, above all, in real world situations: buildings, towns, agriculture, and ecology. I try to show that this way of thinking about computation is closer to intuition and personal feeling than the processes we typically describe as ‚Äúcomputations.‚Äù It is also more useful, potentially, in a great variety of tasks we face in building and taking care of the surface of the Earth, and quite different in character since it is value-oriented, not value-free. Examples are taken from art, architecture, biology, physics, astrophysics, drawing, crystallography, meteorology, dynamics of living systems, and ecology.</p>

I feel that at the level of function, there is nothing thus far that offers a better way to create than editing text. But the "glue code" and the "module code" and the "distributed code" could theoretically all be handled in a graphical manner. At least that's my instinct, I haven't seen it in practice, though Node-RED and NoFlo come close to this idea.</p>

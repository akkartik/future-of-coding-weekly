Might it be more productive to work backwards from making life better for the end user as the path towards better developer tools? e.g. "We want end users to be able to do X, Y, Z in all situations, so what tools do we make to get there?"</p>

Reading "The Humane Interface" or whatever by Jef Raskin was influential to me in that regard, as a design at roughly that scope.</p>
<p>Another angle: it's beneficial to users if the "programming" interface of their system closely resembles how you do things "by hand". You can see this in effect today with some power-user oriented programs where there's a blurry boundary between programming and high-leverage manual interactions (I'm thinking kakoune, but Vim will do, I suspect Photoshop too). Leaning into that idea tightly ties your programming and UI models.</p>

<p>I could see it working if "informing" consisted of adding declarative facts to some AI or other goal-driven system that lets it figure out procedures on its own. But trying to make "inform" mean anything other than supplying declarative knowledge is always going to be a stretch at best, likely a constant source of confusion. The payoff would have to be really big.</p>

<p>but yeah that's what I wondered.</p>
<p>I guess that in french, synonyms to "informer" are more often used. With "renseigner" closer to 'supplying information' and "informer" slightly closer to 'picturing in one's mind'.</p>
<p>Also, 'computer science' translates to "informatique".</p>
<p>(in french it breaks a bit as 'informing', as in 'the act of programming', would become "information", which means 'data')</p>

<p>Something that comes up a lot here is that we represent things with text, building atop it as a kind of “lower level” representation. For this to work, there needs to be some degree of coordination and communication in how these lower level representations should be interpreted.</p>
<p>When digital text first emerged it was standards organisations who made these coordination decisions and they were able to convince or compel other groups to normalise around their decisions. This had limits even back then — see the history of the USA, ASCII, and non-english-speaking world for examples. The computing landscape today is radically different, and it seems unlikely that similar approaches would succeed. So my question is as follows:</p>
<p>If we want to someday go “beyond text” as it currently exists, or build other low-level representations, is this even conceivable today without addressing that low-level coordination? As in, perhaps the only viable way forward is to enable the collective development of these systems of representation. This puts the challenge of (general purpose, low-level) representation firmly into the space of distributed systems, socio-technical systems, digital governance, coordination, communication, etc.</p>
<p>I’m looking to sharpen my thinking here, all thoughts welcome!</p>

<p>Another dimension is formal vs. informal representations. Formal representations encourage formal standards, informal representations encourage informal standards with many variants. Markdown is probably the best illustration of the latter. My guess is that this is the preferred mode of converging on representations for today's Open Source communities. It's well aligned with the spirit of forking and adapting existing things for your own needs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes I’d be surprised to see these kinds of things emerge under the current environment, I’d assume changes to the dominant model of tech development would correlate with new (hopefully better) common representations emerging. As in, beyond the silicon valley style, platform model, etc, this becomes a necessarily political so I’ll avoid that tangent in this thread.</p>
<p>Your point makes me think about the ways we can spur this kind of change. I’ve been trying to articulate recently the difference between the Smalltalk-style theory of change, a kind of “build a system based on vision/principles and show the world it’s a good idea” approach. This is in contrast to the systems that eat away at the old, culminating in a similar kind of transition through different means.</p>
<p>This was recently articulated far far better than my attempts by Stephen Kell in a talk (<a href="https://www.humprog.org/~stephen/research/talks/kell21smalltalk-slides.pdf">slides</a>). He notes that the ‘Smalltalk school’ has leaned towards a ‘design and replace’ approach, whereas Unix was able to “infect” its host system and eventually became so dominant that it becomes the host itself. He advocates the latter as a more viable approach in the modern day which I agree with.</p>
<p>In this community there are differing theories of change and it’s always interesting to see how people view these things. Personally I think the “design and replace” approach isn’t viable (at least when it comes to systemic shifts in how we represent things)</p>

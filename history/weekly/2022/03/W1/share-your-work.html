<p>I have no idea ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure that there will be a next time, or if there is that it will be the same thing. I'm trying to cross-pollinate between groups that have similar ideas but are unlikely to run into each other, and I'll likely experiment with different ways of doing that.</p>
<p>I didn't do as good a job as I was hoping of getting speakers from very different groups. Eg I had no luck finding anyone from fossil, or q, or from the weird bank-internal-software worlds.</p>

<p>It took me a while to figure out how the rule for winning RPS was commutative; that might be worth explaining immediately (in future versions, I guess, I'm sure this was enough work to make without trying to do weird edits).

The opacity of "model" is a problem. Part of the reason I didn't call them 'scenarios', is because the word 'scenario' is typically used in legal training in the context of 'fact scenario', which in comp-sci terms is more analogous to "inputs" than it is to models, which are more of an output... but your point is well-taken. "Stable model" is not a particularly useful term, and we can do better.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what this means, exactly. It's not commutative, I don't think. I expect that if the semantics were a little fuzzy, that's fine. That can be motivation for someone to read the documentation (when it catches up). But I'd be interested to know what you mean, exactly.</p>

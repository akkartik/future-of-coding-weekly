<p>Anyway, yes, information in general and data in particular is only meaningful in conjunction with an interpreter; again, both considered as physical systems rather than bits or code if you want to go down all the turtles. Even in the cushy digital universe, I think it's important to keep track of what the intended interpreter(s) of a given piece of info is/are. I'm guessing we're agreed on that.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a> "Data are raw facts. When analyzed they become information."</p>
<p>What is the difference between a "fact" and "information"? If something needs to be analyzed to be considered information, does that mean an encyclopedia is not information until a human or machine reads it? What does it mean to "analyze"? If the encyclopedia emits photons, and those photons interact with other matter in the world, then has the encyclopedia been analyzed? If so, then the encyclopedia is in a constant state of being analyzed, and so is every piece of data. To exist is to be analyzed. Thus the distinction evaporates. (See also: Appendix A below).</p>
<p><a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> "Data is any symbolic expression using a well-defined notation. Information is data presented in a context that allows its interpretation."</p>
<p>Can data exist outside of the physical universe? If not, then every piece of data is continually surrounded by a context ‚Äî its physical environment.</p>
<p>Moreover, your use of the term "interpretation" is synonymous with Mariano's "analyze", and so I will again assert that data is constantly being interpreted by its environment ‚Äî even if unintentionally.</p>
<p><strong>@Jan Ruzicka</strong> "The term 'data' communicates that any internal structure and relations to external objects are irrelevant."</p>
<p>I can accept this definition. But is it useful in reality? In what situations is it important to stress that you don't care about the structure and relationships that a piece of information expresses? In what situations would using the word "information" mislead a reader where your definition of "data" would not?</p>
<p><strong>@Dalton Banks</strong> "I would define information operationally as data that leads an agent to update its internal model of its environment."</p>
<p>This seems very close to the earlier definitions that "information is data that has been analyzed or interpreted". Thus, I shall refer you to my responses to those, and also to Appendix A. (Also: what conditions are necessary for something to be considered an "agent"? Can an arbitrary collection of atoms be considered an agent?)</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/andrewf">Andrew F</a> "I contend that just because a term is tricky to define doesn't mean it's useless. In what actual situation does the common understanding of "data" fail?"</p>
<p>In general, I agree. However, there are hundreds (thousands?) of research papers, books, and blog posts which laboriously try to articulate a difference between "data" and "information", not to mention companies that are trying to sell products and services related to "information systems". The amount of human effort spent on understanding the (imagined) distinction is considerable. That's the "harm" I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>@abeyer</strong> "I'm curious to hear what you think is an equivalent term for 'data' that is more broadly understood... I'm not coming up with one."</p>
<p>Information üòá (or "formation": see Appendix A).</p>
<p>Appendix A:</p>
<p>Some of the responses in this thread come close to describing information as a process, rather than a thing. One might suggest that "information" is the process of analyzing something, or the process of updating an agent's internal model. In simpler words: information is the process of informing. If we accept this definition, then we still need to describe what things (objects) are involved in an occurrence of informing. An obvious term that could help us is "formation" (or "form"). We could say: to inform is to create a formation (in someone's mind, in a computer, or more generally, at any location in the universe). "In-formation" is then the process of creating such a formation. But what induces a formation to be created? Well... interactions between formations of course! (This matches up with physics: the configuration of the universe is fully determined by interactions between matter and/or energy.)</p>
<p>Given these definitions, the term "data" would be a synonym for "formation". I could accept that.</p>

But I think the real point is that people who actually talk about data for their job aren't significantly confused about what it is. Confusion exists, but mostly in people who don't know how science works or have been lied to.</p>
<p>People who try to exploit confusion about data vs information are especially a red herring. Even if you came up with a perfectly granular term, the BSers would just turn their attention to corrupting that instead. Nothing you do will change that, so it's of limited use at best to factor it in to your actions. Honestly the same is kinda true of people who endlessly muse about definitions, which is another reason not to worry too much about that.</p>
<p>I'll resubmit my original proposal with a tad more precision: data is information (whatever you think that is) that is [claimed to be] derived more or less directly from measuring real phenomena. "Claimed" because, leaving aside falsification, "directly" is somewhat context sensitive, and someone could be mistaken about whether the degree of directness is adequate for a given usage of the supposed data.</p>
<p>I don't think the fuzziness can be entirely eliminated, so maybe I agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/NickSmit_">Nick Smith</a> there. I think it's just one of those cases where "we all know" the concept exists and deserves naming, even if we can't nail down the edges.

It is true that most people are using the term "data" every day, and are effectively communicating with other humans, even though the term does not have a precise definition.</p>
<p>I think the sorities paradox you've linked to pretty much nails the problem with the idea that data is something "directly observed", or something that has "not yet been analysed". Such a definition involves laying down a line/boundary, but in reality it seems such a boundary (between "direct" and "indirect", or between "un-analysed" and "analysed") cannot be made precise.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can make "data" precise by defining it as information which is given as input to a particular computation/analysis. But that would make the term synonymous with "argument" or "input". (I'm pretty sure this was the original meaning of "data" in its modern usage.)</p>

<p>One comment on semantics: in any sufficiently isolated system, semantics is an emergent phenomenon. Well-defined semantics exist only when you focus on a small subsystem (a book, a piece of software, ...), the semantics are then set by surrounding environment via its interactions with the subsystem. It follows that "physics" can not have semantics, because it concerns, by definition, the lowest levels of organizations of matter at the scale of the universe. Shannon's definition of information is just one layer above physics, so it has doesn't touch on semantics either.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the only case of a term from common language being recruited into technical jargon. Energy is another nice example.</p>

<p>Then if you have a list of values, and you‚Äôre checking the presence of a value, the ‚Äúinformation‚Äù is the structure that let‚Äôs you compare them for equality, and the rest is ‚Äúdata‚Äù. Regarding the examples of <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>, some structure of LHC measurements allows physicists to draw the conclusion of the presence of the Higgs, whereas some other structure doesn‚Äôt.

<p>Where you draw the line, really depends on your goal, as sometimes ‚Äúdata‚Äù might become ‚Äúinformation‚Äù under a new goal structure. So I still believe these terms are useful in communication in this sense, albeit they are irrelevant for any practical considerations.</p>

No one thinks a series of e.g. temperature measurements is "structure you don't care about". Note that there is a huge variety of possible analyses you could and likely will run on that series to answer different questions, which may take into account different aspects of its structure (e.g. need ordering for seeing trends but not for averaging), so we can't incorporate a specific interpretation in our definitions besides "this is a time series of temperatures".</p>
<p>I hate to be the one defending the status quo, but the common sense of "data" was basically hashed out centuries ago, and "information" has as rigorous a definition as it can have. We're only muddying the water here.</p>

On the other extreme, when superior performance gives you answers as fast as you can pose questions, you can potentially start asking in a qualitatively different way.

All code and data is part of "the image", which is a persistent object database. Development tools live inside the image as well. A regular text editor is not of much use for using Smalltalk.</p>

<p>from an object standpoint, everything in Smalltalk is an object, but from a 'text' standpoint ? Could we also say that it's a complex hierarchy of text-based code, and that's what describe all objects and their behavior ?</p>
<p>My question is, how much of it can come down to text in hierarchies ? How far from text files are we ?</p>

The closest you get is a string object. Textual code exists as method objects, which store a text representation and a compiled code representation. The overall code structure is an object tree (class hierarchy), of which methods are the leaves and the only nodes that have a text representation.</p>
<p>You can of course represent Smalltalk code as text files. That's what GNU Smalltalk does. It's also what Pharo (the Smalltalk that I use) does for storing code in git repositories. (see <a href="https://github.com/khinsen/GT-OpenAlex/"></a><a href="https://github.com/khinsen/GT-OpenAlex/">https://github.com/khinsen/GT-OpenAlex/</a> for a small example). But I hardly ever look at those text files. They are an implementation detail.</p>

<p>Would love anyone to riff on this idea, or ideas about how to add programmability into it, while maintaining the minimalist approach.</p>

<p>CUE is a logical language, with one matra that goes "wrap code in data, not data in code". It has several more mantra or philosophies.</p>
<p>So while you will be introducing "programmability", you will not be introducing "computability" (i.e. a turing complete language) Doing so opens a can of worms and makes building tooling to query / manipulate so much harder, if not impossible</p>

My 11-year-old did it in 30 minutes. All feedback appreciated. It is user-friendly legal knowledge representation in goal-directed constraint answer set programming. But that sounds scary, the vibe is more like "Scratch for Laws."</p>

To try and create the rule that folks over 18 are allowed to make wills, I made an ‘its true that’ block, put a ‘person is a category block’ in there, and then tried to make a ’person has the attributes ‘age’' block but the ‘known categories’ didn’t update. Cool tool! this kindof thing makes so much sense for a legal system from the perspective of someone outside of the legal world</p>

In the code editor there should have been a tutorial button at the top of the page. You were on exactly the right track, though. Known Categories only updates after you click "save" at the top of the screen (which the tutorial informs you about). Perhaps I should just have the tutorial visible by default. Or perhaps it was the screen layout, and the top bar wasn't visible for you? That seems very possible. I'll prioritize fixing the layout. I'm not as bad at it today as the day I designed that page. :)</p>

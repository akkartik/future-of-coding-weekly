<p>I'm a big fan of FBP and am convinced it didn't catch due to 2 factors:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>previous attempt's had GUIs that weren't good enough. They didn't take complete advantage of the visual layer</p>
</li><li><p>implementation was hard and integration with existing workflows (ci/cd, version control) was almost impossible</p>
</li></ol><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hdUKGZEYUw">youtube.com/watch?v=2hdUKGZEYUw</a></p>

<p>Itâ€™s cool to see incremental projects that look like they can actually be used in real projects today.</p>
<p>Also, are you in Israel? If we collect several of us then perhaps itâ€™s possible to make a local meetup :)</p>

Any thought of going two-directions, so changes in the code result in changes in the flow diagram? Any ideas for how to visualize diffs in the flow interface? Have you considered using zoom to enter into blocks instead of page switching? I feel like zoom has some uncaptured utility for nested structures.</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[June 23rd, 2022 12:28 AM] peterhsaxton: Hej. Glad to have found this community I think it's what I have been looking for for a while. I'm super interested in end user programming. (That seems like a good future of coding topic, or does anyone know a specific "end user programming" community)</p>
<p>Over the last year I have built my own language and structured editor. Pushing the idea of how much can a compiler tell you about your program. The idea is to have a really small AST, there are about 10 different nodes. Because it so small writing new static analysis tools should be easy, it's also really easy to target new environments. i.e. it took me about an hour to write a to Javascript. To keep it small I've made some unusual choices, for one the language contains type provider but not numbers. I keep a dev log of 3-8 minute long videos on various topics. <a href="https://petersaxton.uk/log/">https://petersaxton.uk/log/</a>
Beyond that it's not really usable to anyone else (I haven't documented the keys for the editor so the only way to start is by referring to the source) That might change at somepoint, but I don't know when.</p>

That feels strange, to me, for reasons I can't quite enunciate. Perhaps because the lengths can be so different, and there is no visual cue what part of the right column I'm currently modifying. I'm wanting something like the way cartographers indicate that a portion of the map is at a different resolution.

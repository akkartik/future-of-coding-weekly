<blockquote><p>I was stunned that I could be playing with PageMaker and doing work -- laying my galleys, stuff I'd done in the real world with real objects -- and when I went home at night and remembered what I'd done that day, I remembered working with my hands. I didn't have this image in my head of this digital text block being moved by a cursor. In my mind, I was grabbing galleys and sticking wax on them and laying them down. To me, working with a good interface is working with my hands.</p>

When he said "it still works when you take off your glasses and are half drunk," I was sold. :) What I love about this is that it abandons the naive analogy. People are used to doing drawings, so let's do a digital drawing, was the original idea. Then they abandoned the naive 2D drawing analogy for a projection of a 3D diagram, and it got better. He has abandoned the naive analogy that the pen creates marks on the drawing, and decided it is a 3D input tool, two dimensions of location, one of press. Then invented a language that can be used in the projection. Imagine you allowed the user to draw lines and rotate view at the same time. Touch the pen to the tablet, then spin the view. Boom. Arc, or circle. Inspiring stuff.</p>

<blockquote><p>Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.</p>

<p>It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.</p>
<p>If nodes and wires is "the way" what's missing in node RED for the paradigm to get wider adoption?</p>

The holdup for node red is the positioning &amp; getting started options. They are developer focused, these platforms do better with the non-technical crowd. For developers, most of the time we only need a few specific components at a time, so why adopt a platform that we need to call out to, maintain, etc... when we can just call some functions in our current program, which by the way is sharable if the interface is designed well.</p>

<p>Node and wire is one of ‚Äúthe way‚Äùs.</p>
<p>As a DPL (diagrammatic programming language) node-red leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>Programming languages are IDEs for the task of programming machines.</p>
<p>Consider notations from other more mature disciplines, e.g.</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>electronics schematics</p>
</li><li><p>construction blueprints</p>
</li><li><p>music scores.</p>
</li></ol><p>1 is non-textual, and, node-and-wire.</p>
<p>2 is non-textual, and, diagrammatic</p>
<p>3 is non-textual, and, time-varying, and, hard real-time, and, teachable to 5-year olds.</p>
<p>A technical diagram is a strict subset of more general visual art, like programming languages are a strict subset of more general prose.</p>
<p>What jumps out at me as node-red‚Äôs first-order deficiency is ... <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/2022-07-17-Notation+Suitability">publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/2022-07-17-Notation+Suitability</a></p>

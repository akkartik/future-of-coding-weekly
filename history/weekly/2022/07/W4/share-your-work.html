<p>Alan Kay &amp; Adele Goldberg • Personal Dynamic Media</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the dismal, overbearing weight of last episode's Augmenting Human Intellect, this episode features a paper that is playful, joyful, a thing of charm and wonder. I'm no longer lamenting the future we could have had but didn't (mostly), and Jimmy does all the heavy lifting in terms of bringing sharp analysis and thoughtful reflection despite my best efforts to derail him. As usual, I'll throw a little extra flavour in the thread.</p>
<p>Enjoy! <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/057">futureofcoding.org/episodes/057</a></p>

It's called "Grenades", because the piano part involves taking your right hand and lifting it off the high keys on the far right, lifting it way up high in the air and then forcefully PLONKing a really low note at the far left end of the keyboard — your hand makes this big ark motion through the air, like a grenade. You  <em>have</em>  to do that. It's against the rules to play the song without doing that.</p>

I think this is largely because in this episode you mostly sounded like two students doing your best to understand a master, while in the last two episodes you sounded more like two teachers discussing the shortcomings of a student. The cute nicknames still come across as disrespectful and detract from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A few specific thoughts:</p>
<p>"Communications system" means system for communicating between people.</p>
<p>Games are dynamic, because they respond to the person playing them, but they usually aren't personal because they are written by a team of specialists and the player cannot usually encode new ideas into the game. The game communicates ideas from the creator to the player. (Yes, there are exceptions like Minecraft.)</p>
<p>The point of the meta-medium is that any idea that can be encoded and presented in another medium can be encoded and presented in the computer, though not necessarily in a personal or dynamic manner. For example, streaming a Hollywood movie online uses the computer to emulate film, but it is neither personal nor dynamic.</p>
<p>The "real thing" that children get to do with Smalltalk is communicating by expressing their ideas in a responsive form in a personal dynamic medium, and then see other people interact with those ideas.</p>
<p>Children were the target audience because they can still learn. As Seymour Papert said, all adults are learning disabled. When you're trying to come up with a whole new way of communicating, it helps to work with people who are still able to learn new ways to communicate.</p>
<p>At the time people thought MIT and PARC were kind of crazy for letting children "play" with computers. The fact that some children were able to create programs with Smalltalk as well as some adults using more normal systems of the day was an impressive achievement. </p>
<p>The Alto had a maximum of 512K RAM. That's less than a maxed out 8088 PC, so I'm not sure it's fair to criticize the primitive animation techniques. How much capability was realized in such a small computer is a testament to geniuses like Dan Ingalls who made the system so much more expressive per line of code then almost all other systems of the time.</p>
<p>You probably know this, but the team didn't stop in the 1970s. You should watch Squeakers <a href="http://www.squeakland.org/resources/audioVisual/">squeakland.org/resources/audioVisual</a> for some insight into later work on pedagogy.</p>
<p>Describing the music editor as "typical" doesn't make sense when you're talking about the first program of its kind.</p>
<p>Adele Goldberg wrote Smalltalk-80 The Interactive Programming Environment, and her views and philosophy appear here and there throughout that book, especially at the end.</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn't do a particularly good job of articulating this complaint. I was tempted to remove it from the episode, but left it in because the entertainment value of the rant outweighed the expected downside of listeners issuing counter-complaints.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this is the first time someone made a computerized version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll">this musical interface</a>, but if so, just mentally adjust my wording to "prototypical" and see if that allows sense to be made.</p>

Historically, smear frames in 3d animation haven't been practical because of the limitations of 3d character tools: bones, skinning, IK, vertex weighting, etc., don't allow you to "bend" the character between bones, or duplicate a limb for a single frame, or wildly change the structure of a character. The geometry is  <em>too</em>  reified. The idea of "make a relatively static thing and then move it around, unchanging" is too deeply rooted.</p>
<p>There was a great article (can't find it right now) about the difference between animation in Crash Bandicoot (which was vertex-based) and in Super Mario 64 (which was object-based), and how the former allowed for all sorts of wild expressivity that let them achieve a classic WB cartoon feel, while the latter (a much better game, notwithstanding) looks really stiff, like a puppet. Same era, same(ish) hardware constraints, different implementation, wildly different results.</p>
<p>There are examples like this going all the way back to the origins of computer animation. Tradeoffs were made, and those early tradeoffs became institutionalized, and the culture of computer animation is narrower as a result. You don't see a lot of folks using 3d animation tools to make stuff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE&amp;t=0s">like this</a>. No technical reason you couldn't make a polygon-based modelling, animation, and rendering tool that could excel at that.</p>
<p>You do see this sort of wild expressivity using computer-based tools to produce traditional, frame-by-frame 2d animation. That's great. The computer is helping. But this is an example of the computer just being a better version of a light table and onion paper, as opposed to unlocking entirely new approaches (a la 3d animation).</p>

<p>I'm going to have to be much more careful about how I deliver my off-the-cuff rants in the future. This video is actually a fantastic example of what bothers me about modern 3d animation. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbzzbAxpOaA">a similarly short video</a> showing some of the fun silly things you can do with pencil and paper. Where are the 3d animation tools designed to help you be  <em>that</em>  freeform? Where are the animators pushing hard against the design of typical 3d animation tools in an attempt to make  <em>that</em>  sort of thing? The difficulty lies in the bias typical 3d tools have toward reality. Pencil and paper have no such bias. It's a tradeoff — rendering photoreal animation is hard with pencil and paper, to put it mildly, so the bias is justified. But I'd love (love!) to see computer animation tools designed with a different bias. Flash, Toonboom, et al had a different bias, and did some wonderful things. I want more!</p>

<p>Yeah… sigh. It's like the incompleteness theorem of music. Heartbreaking — I can't have properly tuned octaves and fifths. I can't have properly tuned fifths and major thirds. I do lay awake, staring at the ceiling, lamenting this. I do think about writing music software that helps me write/record music where the tuning system changes on a chord-by-chord basis throughout a piece — sort of like what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vrhKI7JHQc&amp;t=1005s">Jacob Collier does here</a>, but to an even greater extent (because, unlike Jacob, I have a terrible sense of tuning but the ability to write software to help me overcome it, hah)</p>

Creating a single frame where you have an extra limb, or morphing/transforming from one kind of object (eg: a rigged character) into a different kind of object (eg: a landscape) is  <em>hard</em> . The tools that normally assist your animation (eg: character rigs) now work against you.</p>
<p> <em>An</em>  animation frustration is that what traditional cartoons achieved with smear frames, 3d animations achieve with motion blur. This is so pervasive that if you look around for examples of smear frames in 3d cartoons, you only see frames with motion blur (and maybe a little squash / stretch, which isn't too unusual or tricky since the mid 00s, [caveat, caveat, etc]). Smear frames are beautiful and wildly expressive and are created lovingly, individually. Motion blur is pretty much an automatic "How much do you want?" algorithm. The motion blur in Pixar looks the same as the motion blur in Dreamworks looks the same as the motion blur in fucking Earwig and the Witch. Not true of smear frames from classic Disney vs WB vs (etc).</p>
<p> <em>An</em>  animation frustration is that 2d animation tools let you work frame-by-frame, or use tweens. Tweens are ugly by default, and  <em>fine</em> at best. Frame-by-frame is the only way to make transcendently  <em>beautiful</em>  motion. (There are exceptions, of course, but they prove the rule). But, frame-by-frame is only moderately better on a computer than it was when done on paper. There are probably tremendous gains to be had by improving how computers help you do frame-by-frame animation (<a href="https://www.iorama.studio/looom">Looom</a> comes to mind), and by improving tweens.</p>
<p>For all of the above, it's worth noting that I'm talking very much about the way things move and change over time. I'm not talking about what those things are, or what they look like when stationary. That's a whole separate area — another rant for another podcast, perhaps.</p>

<p>I've made a universal app in my language, single program running across multiple machines with function scope defining all interaction between the two computers.</p>
<p> A server function can simply return a function that will be the client app. All variables in scope on the server and used by the client are available on the client. But the client has no way to extend the environment it is sent so does not see any value it is not meant to use. This was enabled by implementing an interpreter, my language was compiled only before this. The server function captures the AST of the inner function and compiles it before sending to the client. Because the inner function is compiled it is still fast on the client. I don't know if there are any other languages that do this. But I am interested to see where this idea can take me.</p>

So finally I can write a public demo of livecoding. This article is maybe too long but its how to implement a webserver including: serving and responding to web forms, serving a dynamic image (e.g. dashboard), and streamed responses.</p>
<p>webcode offers a fairly low level HTTP interface so achieving most of those things requires a fair amount of HTTP knowledge, hence I thought I would just write it up.</p>

How did you do the custom domain per function thing? I really need to do that too.</p>
<p>I've had the idea for dynamic functions in my head for many years (since working on Firebase Functions and hearing every customer complain about deploy times), but it wasn't until I met Observable that there was enough external infrastructure around to make doing it worthwhile. You need a good editor for code content that is URL addressable... though these days there are other options like <a href="http://vscode.dev">vscode.dev</a> so I am wondering if I should branch out and make it a library.</p>

<p>Compound graphs are those where nodes have two kinds of connections: Adjacency and Inclusion. I.e. A node can be a child of another node - in addition to having other kind of edges.</p>
<p>Cytoscape JS is great at visualizing such graphs, but I couldn’t find a visual editor for these kind of datasets. This is NOT a diagram-editor for which there are plenty of choices (like TLDraw or Excalidraw).</p>
<p>This is built with SVG and Svelte and works completely in the browser. I will be open-sourcing it in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>we’ve made some more progress on <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">Wasp</a> lately and added a few bigger features (e.g. running async jobs/workers - <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement">wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement</a>) so wanted to share with the community here 🙂.</p>
<p>Since we’re moving towards Beta and plan to release in a couple of months, we’d also appreciate your feedback - we’re running a small Alpha Testing Program (takes ~45mins + we tried to make it fun :D) and would be thrilled to get your thoughts and ideas on how we can make Wasp better 🙂. You can find more details and apply here: <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82">wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82</a></p>

<p>I'm more of the prof dev, so I'm not sure how valuable my feedback / opinions will be... I prefer text based systems, UIs are too clunky for creating scripts. (though I have to admit, I have a plan for a "ui" like system for devs like me)</p>
<ul><li>I didn't like the way adding options created inputs below, they would probably be easier to relate / understand if they were inline. For example, when I click "header", just add a row with two inputs for key/value.</li><li>The dots look like a drag-n-drop reorder indicator, the vertical three dots typically used for menus would probably be better. Reordering would also be a good feature</li><li>I think tooltips would be helpful, especially on icons</li><li>lifting the remove button up (as an "X") would make it easy to remove entries added by misclicks / exploration.</li></ul><p>Docs will definitely help uptake, anecdotally from my own projects</p>

I have been thinking about a better version of Zapier's Oauth configurer (and in general most of Zapier interface). This seems quite close and has some very nice features like reuse and minimizing the clutter to jsut what is non-default. I really like it!</p>
<p>One thing I often need to do is bind a part of one thing to another thing, like set the AUTH token to a secret value for instance. I don't get a sense that interpolation is possible, it's close to what you described as a link but I don't think its the same thing. (I like that derive thing too).</p>
<p>The thing reminds me a little of JSONEditor <a href="https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor/">json-editor.github.io/json-editor</a> if you have not seen it.</p>

<p>From the presentation perspective: it would be easier to understand if you framed it in a more story-like structure. For example: "If you need to get some data from Google Maps API, and store it in a CSV, this is how you would do that...", and show it end-to end. Even after watching the video and playing with it I'm still unclear if this is supposed to be executed, deployed, or if it will generate code or just a yaml config file.</p>
<p>My opinions on the UI:</p>
<ul><li>it would be nice to have the cards be either pop-ups (be on top of content), or be on the side of the active column, that way it wouldn't move the content up and down.</li><li>It's a bit hard to visually parse the indentation level, maybe increase the horizontal space added with each level, and/or reduce the blank space between the item (icon + text) and the parent line</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div></div></div><div id="2022-07-03T00:17:15.038Z" class="post"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2022-06-30&amp;toDate=2022-07-06&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2022-07-03T00:17:15.038Z" class="date">2022-07-03 00:17:15</a> <div class="message"><p>I showed lines.love <a href="./?fromDate=2022-06-02&amp;toDate=2022-06-08&amp;channel=share-your-work&amp;filter=#2022-06-05T17:46:04.815Z">💬 #share-your-work@2022-06-05T17:46:04.815Z</a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1654451164815879">a few weeks ago</a>, and I've been mostly fixing bugs since. It might be converging to a fixed point now; no more features, bugs slowing to a trickle, most changes containing a 1-line fix and a dozen lines for a test. Then my hope is that it will continue to work reliably for a while without needing any updates (assuming future versions of <a href="https://love2d.org">love2d.org</a> cooperate).</p>
<p>To freeze things I need to provide escape hatches. When people ask for new features, provide them either in forks (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/lines-polygon-experiment#readme">example</a>) or as separate applications entirely. That way the lines.love codebase stays approachable/hackable/habitable, particularly for people who don't need the additional features. Here's an example of a separate application: an exporter to markdown+SVG: <a href="https://codeberg.org/akkartik/lines2md">codeberg.org/akkartik/lines2md</a>.</p>
<p>You can see it in action in this video. There's minimal UI here. I export files by dragging them on the exporter window, and it emits new files in the folder window that I can then open in any markdown application (that can render SVG).</p>

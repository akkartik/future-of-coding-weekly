<p>"For the last decade I‚Äôve chased and wrestled with the ideal of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù software, but I‚Äôve come to see it as a false summit and want to spend some ink on why in the hope that it can lead to a better understanding of simplicity and more intelligent conversations about complexity."</p>

I think this tension is an important one. Simplicity (even in the Rich Hickey sense) isn't an absolute good. Nor do I think it is quite as clear cut objective as Rich thinks.</p>
<p>And yet, I think an emphasis on simplicity has helped me tremendously in developing my own taste.</p>
<p>Clojure's focus on simplicity has helped it be an incredibly productive tool. But it also introduces many frustrations (error messages, lack of java.lang.Function integration, etc).</p>
<p>Other than moderation, how can we better articulate this view point? This distinction isn't quite the same one as worse is better. Are there any good articulations of this middle ground in a more detailed way?</p>

<p>The more recent <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html">vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html</a> is also in this vein.</p>
<p>Overall, though, I find this tradition of writing to not be very actionable. Einstein said all that needed to be said: keep things as simple as possible but no simpler. Now everyone knows to try to keep things parsimonious. Slightly fewer people know to take the whole stack of dependencies into account when measuring complexity, though the recent focus on software supply chains helps here. For the most part we've accomplished what we can with broad generalizations. What remains is the centuries-long task of hill-climbing to simpler solutions in all the domains where software is eating the world.</p>

<p>If we take your point about this article though, I'd ask, what counts as disagreement that is non-linguistic?</p>
<p> Jonathan Blows approach to Jai and the games he writes are decidedly non-hickian. I think a clear case of disagreement. As far as I know, he has never heard Rich Hickey so can't have misunderstood him.  The disagreement is one of actions and values rather than understanding. </p>
<p>I find attractive bits in both of these approaches. I find that Rich is wrong about simple, in his sense, being objective. Are these disagreements or misunderstandings?</p>

<p>My point has been that I don't think we should assume he misinterpreted. And my further meta-point is a frustration with this rhetorical move of claiming people's attempts at substantial disagreement to be merely semantic disagreements (eg misinterpretations). </p>
<p>Claiming the author is backlashing against their own particular interpretation rather than disagreeing with Rich makes it very hard to know what counts as disagreement. I am sincerely asking, how can people signal true disagreement rather than misinterpretation? </p>
<p>Jonathan Blow also takes an old school pragmatism that is directly opposite of Rich's. A dislike for GC. A belief that allocation vs initialization is a key important concept to allow in a language. A dislike for "fancy" data structure. A dislike for immutability, purity, etc. </p>
<p>I don't think old school sensibility is where the disagreement lies. Nor in interface vs implementation. Rich's view against pattern matching for example does not seem to consistent in either of these. </p>
<p>For what it's worth I know people who have worked directly with Rich who have said things similar to what I believe this blog post is getting at.</p>

<blockquote><p>what tools effectively help users manage ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù, how and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The social norms of a community influence the complexity of solutions it comes up with far more than its tools. OP mentions Unix, but Unix wasn't just a tool, it was also a community with its own ethos and philosophy, the "Unix Way".</p>
<p>The problem with Unix was not that the tools were simple in implementation (though they were). They worked fine for the social context they were designed for. The problem was that its success caused Unix to overflow out to communities that didn't share its social norms. Leading to lamentations like <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v">harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v</a></p>
<p>The unsolved problem -- the  <em>unsolvable</em>  problem, IMO -- is how to keep communities from getting to Eternal September, where they overflow to newcomers and the culture fractures.</p>

<blockquote><p>You said that the author misinterpreted Rich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I most assuredly did not. When I say that each person has a particular interpretation, that does  <em>not</em>  mean that there's a platonic ideal somewhere that they're getting  <em>wrong</em> . Does that help clarify what I'm saying?</p>
<p>As for Blow's preferences, I doubt very much that Rich would disagree on those points  <em>in Blow's context of use</em> . Rich has been quite clear that he designed Clojure for writing the kinds of programs he writes (again, frame/context). Many properties of Clojure that make writing correct programs easier come at a cost, and sometimes one cannot afford to pay those costs in a particular situation. These same concerns are also why the largest share of my own career output (counted in LoC) has been C + asm.</p>

<p>I struggle to translate that into any other discipline and have it still make sense.

<p>At the risk of sounding like a grumpy old fart, I remember when pop culture encouraged dedication and patience and learning to crawl before you run with things like "You must complete the training" and "Wax on. Wax off."</p>

<p>I also agree that we need environments with a more shallow and continuous learning curve and with more discoverable capabilities.</p>
<p>I struggle with what I perceive to be an implication (not sure if you meant to imply this or not, but I feel like it is in the air in this thread) that somehow it should be possible to write interesting programs without learning the building blocks necessary to do so. Logo and Smalltalk and Scratch can make it easy to do simple things, and easy to combine simple things into more interesting things, but at the end of the day figuring out how you want to combine those things into something interesting still requires knowledge of the building blocks and skill that takes time and effort to learn.</p>
<p>And, I would argue, some time spent building a little rando pile instead of a house so that you can get a feeling for how those blocks are shaped and what they do. </p>
<p>In designing a system, I think it's important to acknowledge what the system can provide versus what will still be needed from the user.</p>

I remember one educator saying that when teaching programming, they start with the concept that "code" is (usually) text in a file. And build up from there about compilers, assembly languages, modules, packages, package managers, etc. Maybe do that first. THEN tell them what pip is and have them install it. If they can see the path from this step to the thing they want, they gain context, and the "thing they want to do" becomes a motivation to learn how to install pip. If they can't, it's random nonsense until you accidentally learn what it is, and what it's for.</p>

Some spreadsheets can "generate a correlation chart" for some values of "correlation chart."</p>
<p>However, I have no idea how much data is in play or how advanced of an analysis the author is attempting to perform, so I don't know if a spreadsheet could be made to solve the actual problems at hand.</p>
<p>I see the value of creating a map of what tools to use when, but contemplating the number of dimensions in play and how to represent them makes my head hurt. </p>
<p>It seems to me that "experience level" should be split into at least two variables, "computer or programming experience level" and "domain experience level." </p>
<p>Other relevant dimensions I can think of include the size of the problem, the complexity of the problem, which form of efficiency is your priority (examples from the camel book include runtime efficiency, space efficiency, programmer efficiency, maintainer efficiency, porter efficiency, and user efficiency), other software you need to integrate with, and restrictions on acceptable licenses (for example, "no GPL allowed" or "all parts must be open source").</p>
<p>I'm sure I missed more than I thought of, so maybe we need a data model with an arbitrary number of arbitrary attributes to describe the user's needs? At which point this starts sounding more like a library catalog than a map. Or am I overthinking this?</p>

<p>Am I close?</p>
<p>If so, I think it's an interesting question, but I currently lack the imagination to answer it. If someone were to ask me something like "how do if statements and while loops help me write a video game?" I can only think of answers that are unintelligible until after a person has learned the necessary concepts that are bigger than "if"and smaller than "video game." </p>
<p>If they don't have a mental map from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain, how can I show them that the first step actually takes them up a path that will get to the top of the mountain?</p>

To strain the analogy a bit, the answer to your last question is you draw them an actual map, on paper. For your while loop to video games example, you say "video games show video. video is a series of pictures. to create video, the computer creates pictures, over and over again, really fast. Loops are used to get a computer to do the same thing over and over again." Loops -&gt; do stuff over and over -&gt; make pictures over and over -&gt; video -&gt; video game. It is entirely doable, just not usually done. Probably because the training materials are written by and for experts, who suffer from the curse of expertise and are unaware of what they understand that their audience doesn't, and/or because they are written outside of any context so as to be of general use, or use the context only to motivate examples, not the concepts themselves.</p>

<p>I love this story. Basically some programmers packed it in to join the FBI. They worked as operational special agents for several years, until their frustrations with agency IT forced them to just build their own tools guerrilla-style, so they could fight crime better.</p>
<blockquote><p>What drove us was our rejection of the status quo for law enforcement and security solutions, as well as the painstakingly slow pace of the government bureaucracy. &gt; Every single day, we followed the mantra of &gt; ‚Äúbuild high quality software faster than people can say no.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their solution eventually replaced a failed top-down $450m outsourced megaproject.</p>
<p>They left the FBI to sell their case management software full time. The whole company is basically former operational law enforcement. When they realised they couldn't pull the same trick for beat cops as they did for federal investigators, what did they do? Extensive research around these new user needs?? No, one of the founders got a job as a traffic cop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before we turned the &gt; Sentinel&gt;  project around, I saw first-hand how user needs were consistently not met by the software engineers. It wasn‚Äôt because the engineers didn‚Äôt want to meet their needs. On the contrary, non-technical users frequently had trouble communicating their needs to the engineers. Likewise, the engineers frequently misunderstood how the users actually did their jobs, and made inaccurate assumptions about what would and would not work for the end users. One of the keys to our success with the &gt; Sentinel&gt;  project was &gt; our unique dual roles as both end users and software engineers&gt; . There was nothing ‚Äúlost in translation‚Äù between the end users and the engineers, since they were one and the same. &gt; Not wanting to repeat the same mistakes, there was only one thing to do ‚Äî one of us needed to become a local law enforcement officer&gt; .</p>

Much like managers believe that they can manage anything that looks manageable. The application domain is not important, and domain experts are clients, not collaborators. That's mostly an attitude problem, not a competence problem. And the attitude can only survive because the victims tend to share the same belief.</p>

Which I think points to the priblem is systemizing. It's not the fact that we do it, because we have to, but that there are few big systems rather then many small ones. It's "the state", "the tech industry", etc. The implicit idea of universality. It was a big idea of the last century ("universal human rights" "universal truth through science", ...) but I think it's time is over.</p>

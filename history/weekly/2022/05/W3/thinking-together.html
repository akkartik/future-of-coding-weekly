<p>I tend not to worry about this question, because of how I think about this community. It's to bat around raw ideas, prototypes and experiments, but hallway usability studies here are not a replacement for getting out of the building and engaging with your target audience, whoever that is.</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[May 12th, 2022 1:35 PM] stevekrouse: Nadia recently published a fantastic new essay on "Idea Machines: a network of operators, thinkers, and funders, centered around an ideology, that‚Äôs designed to turn ideas into outcomes." The main example she uses is "effective altruism". She also refers to the "tools for thought" community (which we are related to) as something that could turn into an idea machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://nadia.xyz/idea-machines">https://nadia.xyz/idea-machines</a></p>
<p>I think our community is fairly close to being an "idea machine". We are missing some <em>funders</em> (though we do have some), as well as a shared <em>agenda</em> (though we do have some). I personally intuit that we're just a small amount of branding (I never liked the name "future of coding" all that much, and yes I came up with it) away from the status of the "tools for thought" or even the "effective altruism" communities. I feel like our community needs to be easier to "point to" in the way one can point to EA.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on branding or other structural changes we could do as a community to become more effective?</p>

<p>For a long time now, I've been moonlighting on the stuff that has the most meaning to me. I justified it to myself as "having agency over my coworkers, the people who give me feedback and may collaborate with me." But how's that been going for me? It's been sinking in lately that the answer is: not great. Institutions can provide a benefit I hadn't appreciated until now: funding acts as Schelling Points to help coordinate people. It's a bit analogous to how prices help transmit information in an (idealized) market to help coordinate production.</p>

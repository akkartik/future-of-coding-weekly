Since our source of truth is TypeScript code (as an AST) we can reason about the flow of React props and conditional rendering of elements/class names. The challenge is to provide a meaningful UI for a designer based on what's essentially open-ended TypeScript code. Same as the TypeScript compiler does flow analysis, there may be cases where code is too difficult to follow for the tool (which we would then tell the user), but there may be an 80/20 rule in there where just giving designers a bit of conditionals would add a lot of value.</p>

When code is too difficult for a good tool to follow, either (1) the code is bad, or (2)  it's implementing some higher order pattern that uses a different mental model than the flow that the abstraction layer ends up producing.</p>
<p>Rails filters come immediately to mind as an example of (2).  <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters">guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters</a> The mental model is pretty simple, but the control flow that leads to their execution is pretty much inscrutable.</p>

A small-scale knowledge graph with a lightweight interface looks very useful indeed.</p>
<p>From my first impressions, I'd say yours is already getting too complex. Example: the way you disambiguate "Bart" by context. For a personal knowledge database, I'd probably prefer to keep entities unique, implying longer names, and add a completion interface for discovery and for faster entry. You'd type "Bart" and the system proposes all the entities containing "Bart" for selection.</p>

<p>To clarify the underlying model,  <code>@Bart</code>  and  <code>@[Bart Simpson]</code>  are separate entities, marking it as synonymous just allows them to be switched in/out in a query. This was meant to be like Wikipedia titles. The canonical title will be something globally unique like "Queen Victoria (British monarch)", "Victoria (Australian state)", but will typically be referred to by a name ("Victoria") which is only contextually unique. This was my attempt to reflect how humans use names, but without introducing too much "magic" on the computer side.</p>
<p>A dumb example that might be more clearer of the point of this feature;</p>
<pre><code>@[My front door]

   !Door

   #closed



@[My garden door]

   !Door

   #not-open



@[Half open interval [0, 1)]

   ![Subset of the Reals]

   #not-open #not-closed



!Door

   #not-open = #closed

</code></pre><p>Then the query  <code>#closed</code>  with return the two doors, but not the set, because the rule  <code>#not-open = #closed</code>  does not apply in the context of  <code>!Set</code> , only  <code>!Door</code> .</p>

Most pull requests (about 2/3) get merged without corrections, and the idea is to have the bot detect and approve them. This was born out frustration constantly waiting for 'code review' for small and safe code contribution, especially since I believe in "ship small &amp; often. Also it allows you to focus on the trickier changes instead.</p>
<p>👉 Here's how it works: anybody can do a 'historical' test on any repository here - <a href="https://codeball.ai/">codeball.ai</a> to test out the accuracy. To do reviews on new pull requests, it's setup as a GitHub action.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what you smart people think! Happy to also share more about the model too (basically it's a neural net, the inputs include features about the code, the author and author experience with the code changed, trained on over 1M code contributions).</p>

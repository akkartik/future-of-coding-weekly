<p>Another word for structure is recipe. Recipes are difficult for most non-coders to wrestle with because they force a mental model of ‚Äúdo A, then B, then C to hopefully achieve the X that I want‚Äù. A recipe by its definition means that the outcome ‚Äì the thing the user is trying to achieve - is a separate thing, which usually divides the UI into two distinct and somewhat disconnected parts.</p>
<p>This brings me to outcome-driven coding (ODC). I‚Äôm making up this term, surely there is a term grounded in research? üòÅ With ODC, we‚Äôre flipping the script, and letting users work in a way that follows a pattern of ‚ÄúTinker and change until it (the outcome, not the recipe) feels right‚Äù.</p>
<p>By mostly hiding the program structure, and showing the outcome of running the program live, an ODC tool can be made on top of an existing programming language, leveraging an entire eco-system of existing work, be it open source, or existing code bases that a product team is working on. This is a big deal for adoption of such a tool, and the foundation for collaboration with developers using IDEs.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an interesting trade-off here that has to do with expressive power versus complexity in a VPL environment. With ODC, we can manage that complexity by deciding on which parts of a code base that visual programming is best suited for, and which parts to ‚Äúleave alone but still execute to show the real product outcome‚Äù. Parts of a code base are inherently about the human element and the user experience. Let's call this "design code". Design code naturally centers on using and defining design system components, the visual language, use of data, navigation flows, and pages. This is where visual programming shines.</p>
<p>The ODC approach lets us create a tool that is optimized to work with design code visually, in a way that UX designers prefer, while allowing traditional business logic code to execute unhampered inside the tool. The key is to allow collaboration on a single shared code base, with tools specialized for the unique skills and needs of the people in a cross-functional team.</p>
<p>Would be great to hear what this group thinks of this hybrid approach, and whether there is existing work that is similar. Thanks üôÇ</p>

Start with the concrete, gradually abstract.</p>
<p>How similar/different is outcome-driven coding to programming by example?  Certainly, normal people don't follow recipes, let alone write them.  They have a sense for what a good outcome will be, and if it's not going that way they'll double check, tweak, and outright ignore the steps.  Is improvisation what makes us human?</p>
<p>Good programmers, on the other hand, generally have two uncanny skills:</p>
<p>1) Can play computer, can model, often in their heads, what the steps will actually do rather than what they should do, it's like how an artist can imagine what a subject actually looks like rather than an simpler abstraction.</p>
<p>2) Can sense edge cases and complicating interactions.  Yes, but when you combine this with that what happens?</p>
<p>Liveness helps to address (1).  There are challenges certainly, but what do we do to help a person with (2)?  You could say static checks try to address (2).  I have a recent example in mind.</p>
<p>Trying RubyMine for fun, it flagged an  <em>obviously</em>  fine stretch of code:</p>
<pre><code>@instance_variable = [an, array, of, things]

@instance_variable.map(&amp;:whatever)

# ... later in the method ...

@instance_variable = nil</code></pre><p>as potentially raising "NoMethodError: undefined method for nil:NilClass."  Smart tool not so smart?  Typing  <code>@instance_variable</code>  based on all its uses ignoring control flow?  Replace  <code>@instance_variable</code>  with  <code>local_variable</code>  no error.  Why the difference?  Thread safety!  Would be nice if the tool explained as much, but there you have it.  (Of course, no sane person uses threads in Ruby, or ever, but that's another conversation.)</p>

<p>You can definitely get the feeling of a "spreadsheet on wheels" from it. Brad Cox, the creator of Objective-C, really admires it as the highest stage of programming modularity, basically as a super-object level that is directly manipulable and visible.</p>

<p>The article is about how ubiquitous search and cloud storage have meant that young folk no longer have a mental model of file systems, or really understand files and folders. I had suspected I was observing this in my work, with some of the questions I was getting in our introductory content about CLIs. The educators confirmed they're also seeing this and it's a big problem. </p>
<p>That struck me as a big issue for CS education. If students are coming in never having interacted with an app that deals in files, saving files, or organising content in directories, that's a huge hurdle to beginning programming, or interacting with most tools. Everything we do and use still has the file system at the centre of the experience and the interface. </p>
<p>Whether the ‚Äútabletification‚Äù of computing is a positive thing or not, it's interesting to me that unlike many categories of applications, developer tools, even for young learners, have resisted it </p>

The only real benefit (or unfair advantage?) it has is that every programming language/environment has built-in APIs for interacting with the app.</p>
<p>I think the right path forward is for OS developers to abandon the idea of a file system as a ‚Äúblessed app‚Äù, and create better and more general ways for apps to share data directly with each other. Mobile OS‚Äôs have been heading in this direction for a while.</p>
<p>This will make the ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù metaphor entirely obsolete, but that's ok. I'd say its time has passed.</p>

<p>Dev tools face a pressure to be low-abstraction, because we never know what weird detail is going to get picked up and branched on by our eldritch runtime stack of OS, language VM, etc. For that weird detail to be  <em>invisible</em>  because of our shiny UI is intolerable. This kind of thing already happens far too often for my taste. My dev tools need to be an anchor in this ocean of insanity, not another contributor. So I think dev tools, at least for professionals and those who wish to be such, are unlikely to change and absolutely should not change until the underlying OS does.</p>
<p>I also reject the notion that "smart college students" are incapable of learning a hierarchical file system. If they're not getting it, you're doing a bad job teaching it. (Granted, the attempts of mainstream OSs to split the difference don't help, with multiple dumbed-down views onto the same tree. Funny how devs gravitate toward OSs that make that tree easier to see.)</p>

<p>Or did you mean a file explorer rather than a file system? Calling file systems apps feels not even wrong. Syscalls are not apps.</p>
<p>The big difference between system software and application software is one of incentives. An OS maker needs people developing apps, and so has an incentive to standardize and maintain interfaces independent of products or apps. Two apps interchanging information often lack such transparently aligned incentives.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My vision for inter-app communication demands that apps exist in a wholly new (i.e. not-yet-invented) operating environment that offers a novel model of data communication. The model will  <em><em>not</em></em>  be message-passing (i.e. syscalls, APIs, etc); it will be something closer to shared immutable state. But the details are unimportant here (and I'm still working on them). My main point is: this would be the "standard" you are speaking of, but it involves no "intermediary app", and it involves no "central file system". (After all, have you ever heard of an immutable file system?)</p>

Files and directories, especially in the Unix tradition, are the simplest level of object that can be meaningfully shared between programs. The issue is that a file is just a stream of bytes to whoever reads it; the knowledge of how to turn that into information stored separately, which makes interoperability buggy yet still feasible. Instead of a stream of bytes, maybe files can contain the behavior that makes them information bearing objects, so that an unforeseen consumer doesn't have to write more string munging routines, just send a message. This has to be consistent and ubiquitous from the bottom up in order to work, which requires an operating system alien to the current ones we use and more like Smalltalk.</p>
<p>Filesystems are really just trees (DAGs if you add in symlinks (that don't create cycles please!)), so representing, traversing, and serializing them shouldn't be infeasible in a language that elevates the file to an object. This also opens up the possibility of distributed object spaces in the vein of Jini/Plan9, where access across machines/networks can be mediated mostly transparently, especially with some notion of capabilities, which file systems already have a primitive level of in W/R/X permissions. The possibilities are endless, which is probably why so many people get lost and we remain in the enduring 70s frame of Unix.</p>

<p>Here's a case where multiplayer undo-redo becomes interesting for visual programming.</p>
<p> <em>(This would be visual programming, e.g. via a blocks/node interface, but I'll use JavaScript and React to express the states)</em> </p>
<p> <em>Initial state:</em> </p>
<p>Empty div.</p>
<pre><code>return (

 &lt;div&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;

);</code></pre><p> <em>User A:</em> </p>
<p>Inserts a new Dialog component, which uses an "open" state to control its rendering.</p>
<pre><code>const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

return (

  &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;Dialog open={open} /&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;

);</code></pre><p>Now, an undo by User A at this point would rightly remove both the  <code>useState</code>  statement and  <code>Dialog</code>  element. But, lets say user B does this before that:</p>
<p> <em>User B:</em> </p>
<p>Inserts an expression that references and displays the open state:</p>
<pre><code>const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

return (

  &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;Dialog open={open} /&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Open: {open}&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;

);</code></pre><p>If User A now wants to undo, removing the  <code>open</code>  state would break User B's use of said state.</p>
<p>Are there any examples in research or open source of how to gracefully resolve this? I assume that node based programming could run into this dependency challenge, but I'm unaware of any node based tools that support multiplayer with undo/redo.</p>
<p>One approach I can think of is to check whether there are dependencies on nodes that would be removed by undo, and simply aborting the undo with an error, but I'm curious if there is a more elegant approach.</p>
<p>On a related note, the UI would also have to prevent a traditional delete operation on the  <code>open</code>  state, since this would leave the program in an invalid state.</p>

If A creates something, B builds on it (more generally, makes a dependent change), and then A hits Ctrl-Z it should register a conflict in exactly the same way as if A manually deleted the thing. Maybe the only difference would be that the parent state of the undo op is guaranteed to be the result of the op it's undoing, rather than incorporating other changes (this sidesteps the question of whether A's client has seen B's edits). But the basic idea is that you need to handle all those cases anyway, so just use them for Undo. Ed: I guess I should be explicit that in this scenario the undo stack or whatever is probably private state, scoped to the client.</p>

We already use reverse ops for undo, but they don't have the concept of a blocking conflict error. I guess the thing that tripped me up was the search for conflict-free ops, but it seems like if program structures are dependent, yet can be independently removed (or at least attempted to), it's unavoidable to run into blocking conflicts since the program would otherwise end up in an invalid state.</p>
<p>In practical terms, these will be edge cases, but they still need predictable behavior. For user A there is still the option to first delete the  <code>open</code>  state expression that user B added, and then remove the Dialog along with the  <code>open</code> state that no other elements depend on now.</p>

<p>Incidentally, for me the idea of explicit conflict markers is tied to my ancient ideas for an editor for prose/poetry that lets you keep around various possibilities for a line or passage. So I guess if you go that route, and also use it for conflict markers, uh, let me know. :)</p>

<p>If it's a platform where users can see different states locally, then I think User A's local state should roll back to as if they had never created the Dialog, and User B should now be treated as having implicitly created the Dialog the moment they made a dependent element.

<p>For real time, the program must always be in a valid state, otherwise we can't compute the visual outcome that needs to be rendered onto the canvas where the designer is doing their work and interacting with the program. Multiple designers viewing the same canvas should be seeing the same thing (converging on it at least, as updates cross the network).</p>
<p>Then, once the design work is ready to go into the shared git repo via a push, a traditional conflict can occur, e.g. if developers renamed a component that the designer added new instances of.</p>
<p>While we could technically have diverging local states for the canvas for each designer (visual programmer more generally), I suspect that would amount to mind-melting complexity that these "end-user" programmers would rather do without. The way we can go about exploring different design choices (program structures) would be driven by creating separate branches, where each branch checkout has a single shared + converging canvas.</p>

<p>I've had the idea in the back of my mind for a long time that UI sucks. It's bad for us as programmers when we have to build an app across 5+ form factors (more when you consider the possibility of AR, VR, or voice assistant applications). It's bad for the consumer when we develop a bad UI. It's bad for the consumer when we build a good UI, but it's not talored to how individuals use it. For example I use about 5% of the potential functionality of my IDE, but it's extremely tedious ranging to impossible to customize the UI for myself. Yes, keyboard bindings exist but for the most part let's ignore that. Most casual users won't learn Keybindings. And, that ignores that I'd like to comstomize the application state I can view.</p>
<p>OK, the problem established, I'd like to think about a solution: stop writing UI. Instead, write api descriptors so an agent can design a UI for you, knowing the capabilities of your application. Early versions of an agent will require massive amounts of hints, but that's probably still easier than writing UI. Having an agent (ai maybe?) would also allow input from individual users to the system with hints as to how they want to view the app. "show the buttons in this order. " "show the status of this in that box." etc. Graphql is the closest approximation of such an api descriptor I can think of.</p>
<p>On to the questions: Has this been considered before? What prior art is in this space? Are we near technical feasibility of such a project?</p>

It was written in the late 90's and so didn't really grasp how the internet would come to work over time.  Its premise was that a lot of the world was immersed in virtual reality worlds, but one group of ultra rich folk had built a secret system that was impossibly realistic, and well, it got weird from there.   Still, it had some interesting concepts that really inspired me.  Two in particular:</p>
<ul><li>Sellars, and older guru-like figure, had a garden at his home on the military base which was secretly his access to his file system.  Eg, each leaf and stem on the plant was representative of files and connection between them, and they could only be accessed by being in the physical space with the plants.</li><li>The assassin character had a generative music implant in his head, which allowed him to mentally tweak the inputs on the music playing in his head, triggering swells in the orchestra, or moving from slow to fast rhythm, or changing keys or genres.  Not playlists either, but properly generative, with inputs from his own subvocal commands, but also from the environment (eg, light or other sounds)</li></ul><p>I think there are probably a wealth of future-of-coding ideas in older scifi novels.</p>

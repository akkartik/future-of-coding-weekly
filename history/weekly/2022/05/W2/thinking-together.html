<p>Loewy‚Äôs secret was essential to design for the future ‚Äì but delivering the future gradually. He designed his famous logos, some of the most recognizable cars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, refrigerators, and locomotives for his users‚Äô present needs and skills while pushing the boundaries of design and technology beyond his users‚Äô expectations. He called this approach the MAYA principle. Maya is an abbreviation for ‚ÄúMost Advanced. Yet Acceptable.‚Äù which means that Loewy sought to give his users the most advanced design, but not more advanced than what they were able to accept and embrace. Loewy believed that:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The adult public's taste is not necessarily ready to accept the logical solutions to their requirements if the solution implies too vast a departure from what they have been conditioned into accepting as the norm."</p>

<p>When we think about the data structures our programs use or the execution flow of our programs, I‚Äôm pretty sure we all think visually and if we had to explain it to someone we would be drawing diagrams on a whiteboard. Yet pretty much all our coding and debugging is text-based. We are forced to visualize things in our minds.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been debugging the PostgreSQL codebase to better understand how things work. I think a lot of people treat it like a scary magical black box, but it‚Äôs quite easy to debug a query‚Äôs execution path, and start to understand how it works.</p>
<p>When we learn about databases, say from Andy Pavlo‚Äôs CMU database course, there are a bunch of core diagrams used to explain things. Like the parse tree, logical plan tree, physical plan tree, disk storage layout, btree/bitmap/hashmap index, etc.</p>
<p>So what I was thinking was to instrument the PostgreSQL C codebase (via LLVM-IR), and then visualize some of the key data structures and stores. Imagine how easy it would be to teach database internals, if you could type in a query, and then visually step through the actual execution of the query with visual diagrams. I would imagine that any PowerPoint slides and diagrams could be replaced by this visual interface with a slider and some filtering options for what to show.</p>

There is an embedded video of it working though.</p>
<p>The bit I am working on at the moment is explaining causal consistency &amp; at-least-once semantics. But I hit a fairly hard wall there as creating bespoke diagrams for each concept is quite a lot of work and each is quite a difficult concept. Consistency is super important for a DB but it does not so much manifest in data-structures but why components are connected in the order they are. Checking for causal consistency is kinda hard but it would be a visualization of each participants history on some load testing data.</p>
<p>Anyway, my broader point is that I am super interested in collaboration with visualizing DB concepts. Very interested in what topics you will focus on.</p>

<p>It depends. If you take the idea of following biology really seriously, you end up with layers of organization in which each layer's complexity does not mess up the layers above it, because they work in terms of emerging phenomena. This approach has never been tried in computing, as far as I know. All our computing technology is based on the idea of assembling ever more complex formal systems from ever more rigid components. The biological approch would aim for informal systems, systems that adapt to context.</p>
<p>If that approach works, which we don't know, it will probably solve different problems than today's formal-system computing. So I think there is a place for both in our future.</p>

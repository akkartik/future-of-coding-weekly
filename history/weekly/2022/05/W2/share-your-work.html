<p>That... can't be true!? That beggars belief! It's a cute story, but there are countless geometric things that kids learn long before they get to play with compasses.</p>

<p>(1) Categorizing objects based on their properties e.g. a quadrilateral is a figure with four strait sides, in a trapezoid one pair of sides is parallel, in a parallelogram both pairs of sides are  parallel.</p>
<p>(2) Constraint propagation e.g. line a is parallel to line b, line b is parallel to line c, so line a is parallel to line c.</p>

When I loaded up other projects, I saw much wider files, deeper ‚Äòstacks‚Äô, and without seeing the code itself, I felt like I had a sudden familiarity.

I can and I will happily. I even made another small demo gif. I‚Äôm going to try to put some more samples on the github page to help too, because it‚Äôs got a few more bells and whistles that kinda fit together.</p>
<p>In that screenshot, the blue rectangles are directories. They are ‚Äústacked‚Äù by their depth in a directory tree, and every file is a simple long black rectangle rendered like a big sheet of paper. The trick, though, is that each glyph of text on the sheet is a 3d node - it can move and interact in space!</p>
<p>In the gif, you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm grabbing some directory out of a new rendered stack. Then, I turn on ‚Äòhover info‚Äô, which shows the results of hit-testing the nodes underneath the mouse arrow. Finally, it does some syntax tree walking to figure out what the syntax/semantics are of that individual glyph, and all of its associated nodes. As I click in the AST node list, you can see the text that represents that piece of the syntax tree ‚Äòhighlighting‚Äô and gaining some z-depth and color. And, as more nested stuff is selected, the nodes are free to move even further away to demonstrate that deeper nesting.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs one of the first pieces of none-2d-only sample I‚Äôve got. I‚Äôm not too far away from doing things like, ‚Äúgive me all the nodes for class declarations and make a grid out of them‚Äù or ‚Äústack up all the functions and order them by width then height‚Äù. This is where you come in - help me make more! üòâ</p>

Something like ‚Äúclasses are cubes, protocols are spheres, functions are pyramids‚Äù and then having them hierarchically organized in a similar manner to the directory. All ways to get ‚Äúquick visual insight‚Äù into what‚Äôs currently rendered. Then, of course, there‚Äôs things like ‚Äúdraw a line through these functions to show their execution order‚Äù - I‚Äôm working on that with the execution trace now, and the flashing text is showing each traced call happening in order. Making a directed line from that dealing with loops and the like is a burning goal..</p>

I‚Äôm very curious if you have some ideas to bounce my way - what kinds of features would you like to see? (no pun intended. ok maybe a little.)    Let‚Äôs say sky‚Äôs the limit - what do you wish you saw this doing?</p>

It can be dramatic!  I'm into visualizing execution traces.  Imagine each step as a little wooden strip, a popsicle stick.  Now you have a chain of them, a ribbon, millions of links long.  Use rules to fold that ribbon.</p>
<p>For example, here's a standard view that I like.  Developed in stages:</p>
<ul><li>Put each step below its predecessor.  The ribbon goes from the sky to the underworld.</li><li>If a step is a call, put it to the right of its predecessor.  Now, the ribbon zigs from left to right.</li><li>If a step is a return, put it to the left of its predecessor.  Now, the ribbon zigs and zags.  It's still quite tall.</li><li>If there's a gap between a step and the one visually above it, collapse it.  Now this structure is compact with lots and lots of overlap in the middle.</li><li>If some steps are on top of each other, put earlier steps in front of later steps.  Now we a nicely oriented 3D tree.  Left to right shows call stack depth.  Top to bottom is order of execution.  Front to back shows things at the same depth with the stuff the executed first in front.</li></ul><p>Walking around the tree gives you some perspective.   More comes from, say, making distances smaller the deeper you are in the stack.  It still looks like a mess.  But for me the real, real mind blower was to add a breeze.  Suddenly the connections in this elaborate structure are as easy to see as the separate branches of a real tree.</p>

I'm trying to think how I would implement this with my current structures. The library currently traces entry and exit of calls, so I could handle the left/right distinction. The list is a set of ids, so theoretically it's not too hard to pull from the list as many times as can be rendered. The sky's the limit indeed.</p>
<p>This may sound simple, but I could render the persisted UUIDs that represent the call stack into a text layer. Then, stack these text-popsicle-sticks, and arrange them with the left/right pattern. The ifs have a static length so that's easy to make basic assumptions on for layout. It'll look like a big block of code, but indeed, with all those gaps and zig zagging, little mountains. I have a few questions about implementing that sort of packing algorithm! Haha.</p>
<p>You mentioned introducing a breeze - I'm not sure about that one, is that a technique for some kind of graph interaction? This is a first for me all around for this tech and these ideas, so I have a ton to learn and absorb.</p>

Would love any and all feedback, do you think this could be a more accessible style of programming for beginners? Also as it's a "vm" it may be well suited to low-code programming environments. My next milestone goal is to integrate the language into a REPL. Note that this is a very rough draft, you can't even make strings! But the concept should be clear.</p>

<p>I didn't design <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">github.com/akkartik/mu</a> to be read aloud, but now that I think about it, it feels a bit nicer to read aloud since statements really occupy a single line and are therefore constrained to be short. The cost: lots more temporary variable names, so you'd have to ensure they're don't sound too similar to each other.</p>
<p>Have you considered creating just a style of JavaScript that is convenient to read aloud?</p>

I keep getting confused by the structure of it as the semantics of the at/call/push paradigm are nearly inside out from the standard ALGOL style procedure call. The simplicity of your approach is very refreshing compared to JS; however, I only wish it could sit under it rather than above it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the most "readable" languages look like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk</a> or Ruby - quite verbose, though with linguistic affordances carrying a lot of context. We have communication hard-wired into our brains, but inventing languages that take advantage of this is more of an art than a science. The more whoever is learning it knows a different type of language, the more the impedance mismatches between them will trip them up compared to an absolute beginner.</p>

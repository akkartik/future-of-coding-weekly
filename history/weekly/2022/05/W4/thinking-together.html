One comment from Dan Ingalls that has stuck with me is that while the PARC systems that Alan Kay's LRG group built were slower than software from other groups (like the Bravo editor, which was written directly in BCPL), their turnaround time for experimentation was so quick that it more than made up for the slower system speed. Now with computers as powerful as they are now (even the PineNote boasts a 64 bit 1.8 Ghz quad core chip with 4Gb of memory and a GPU), there is no excuse not to have live editable systems directly on the devices we use.</p>

You could create a Smalltalk with no UI other than an input text stream. In fact, GNU Smalltalk is almost at that level. Given such a Smalltalk, you could then build different UIs on top of it. It's not fundamentally different from other dynamic languages. The real difference is that the Smalltalk community has since the beginning valued good UIs and development tools.</p>

<p>I've actually been struggling with this question a whole lot outside this community. Perhaps I should bring y'all in:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/i1b6tw/computer_science_was_always_supposed_be#c_2mffpq">lobste.rs/s/i1b6tw/computer_science_was_always_supposed_be#c_2mffpq</a></li><li><a href="https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/35/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-38">forum.merveilles.town/thread/35/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-38</a></li><li><a href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/107896035093628757">merveilles.town/@akkartik/107896035093628757</a></li><li><a href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/108043961340591227">merveilles.town/@akkartik/108043961340591227</a> (and thread)</li></ul><p>The conclusion I've currently arrived at is:</p>
<ul><li>The kind of computers we have today prioritizes large organizations that pay people with money. The influence of this mindset is deep and infects almost all our tools. This "computer industrial complex" is often useful on short timescales, but it is also blind to a lot of the value people create with it. As a result, future decisions by the computer industrial complex often destroy value at people scales.</li><li>Right from the start (suspense alert), there's been a shadow computer with a different, more convivial purpose. Confusingly, this shadow computer often looks just like other computers. You have to look closely to look past the camouflage.</li><li>It's hard to see what people would do with these shadow computers if we weren't immersed in a world created by organizations. After some time thinking about it, I can't find a better answer than the one (drumroll) Vannevar Bush arrived at, right at the start: one thing convivial computers are  <em>definitely</em>  for is to externalize our brains. Paper expands memory. Computers expand both memory and modeling.</li></ul><p>This is a surprising, even shocking, conclusion for me to arrive at. I've always slightly looked down my nose at all the "tools for thought" conversations in this Slack. It's felt too close to productivity porn most suitable to avoid doing anything productive. Suddenly they're super relevant.</p>
<p>But it's not enough to build more tools for thought. We have to think also about the process by which they're built. We have to ensure that the people-factory generating the convivial iPhone is also convivial. Because if it isn't, the conviviality will be short-lived as organizations kill or coopt it for their needs. The most important property to preserve, IMO, is to keep the raw code as naked and free from packaging as possible. It should be literally begging to be opened, inspected, tinkered with. Most software today fails to fit this bill. C programs come without source code by default. Browsers require big honking machines to be built from source. We write lovely naked Ruby code but then package it up into gems that go hide in some system directory where nobody can go look inside them.</p>
<p>This is what  <em>my</em>  future of software looks like.</p>

Paraphrasing here, the computer is a communications medium that allows us to share simulations of our ideas with other people which they can then run, modify, and test in order to better understand and question the ideas being communicated. It is personal in the sense that anyone can use it to create simulations of their ideas and share them. It is dynamic in that the simulation can respond to the recipient of the message who is attempting to understand it. The recipient can ask the simulation "what if?" questions of the sort that have only historically been possible when conversing directly with the person who has the idea.</p>
<p>It can also allow others to respond to and critique messages by pointing out flaws in a simulation and publishing an improved version.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by allowing us to think and communicate more deeply about complex issues, this could help bring about another enlightenment in the same way that the printing press helped bring about the last one by allowing people to communicate ideas and arguments that were too long to remember all at once.</p>

<p>When someone builds a tool, it’s because their brain is attempting to do what you said: externalize a thought. They’re building a representation of their brain’s wiring. It’s amazing. It also means there are trillion-billion-billion ways to organize thoughts and ideas, which is also amazing but daunting.</p>
<p>This is why I’m building my project. My version of “tech” is that everything is a cog in someone else’s machine.  <em>Everything</em> . I used to flip boolean flags in iOS world hoping for views to come out differently, and would be surprised when they did - because there was no mental map I could rely on to help me understand  <em>what the hell this was actually doing</em> . I wanted -  <em>need</em>  - the ability to and  <em>for myself</em>  look as arbitrarily deep or as shallow as a system allows. Big corp hates that, because then you understand what they did, and then you don’t buy it anymore. Boohoo.</p>
<p>I want to click a file and see code. Then, knowing that  <em>every single token</em>  has a meaning - either as an identifier locally or someone else - and understand it in whatever context I wish. If you’ve seen the movie Arrival, with the Heptopod ink language, this is what I mean. Every curve and contour of your software does something and has a direct cause and effect. That’s what all the computer science research did for us, and is doing for us. Codifying cause and effect and strengthening the guarantees that paradigm offers.</p>
<p>I want “the mechanic that grows up around a family shop” to be in  <em>exactly the same space</em> as “the techie that grows up around a computer store”. These people are not different - they’re experimentalists.</p>
<p>The difference is the tools they have and can create, and who - in this current world - owns and  <em>allows</em>  new ones to be created.</p>

<p>The first moment I ran my project and saw the code that was running it fly up in space and just.. stare back at me, I had a feeling I didn’t understand. I still don’t understand what it was. It was kinda accomplishment, but my brain just… did something. I felt a click. I saw every single individual glyph and line of code all at once and just went, “…huh”.</p>
<p>My brain had never before that day used its optical nervous system to simultaneously process the entire visual representation of a codebase other than as a list of “files” and “directories”, already abstractions I had to come up with visual metaphors for.</p>

The development of computing in modern times has followed the same driving force as all other industrial technologies. From the absurd keurig coffee maker to the ever-present WalMart (in the US) to the roadways that consume land to the very design of cities themselves. It all serves one primary purpose: profit. The only reason PARC and Vannevar Bush were able to get as much amazing work done in so many creative directions was a relatively absent profit motive (read: mostly unhindered research). I shudder to imagine what the computing world would look like if early development were dominated almost exclusively by the profit motive via corporations, as it is now.</p>

<p>You see the first case much more in universities, it's there, but its not connected to business. You get random software that a prof made for enumerating mathematical objects in  <em>such and such</em>  space. Thats the computer as a mind extender. Its lovely. I prefer programming computers for science but society as a whole finds more use in the second case, and rewards accordingly.</p>

There's nothing wrong with profit. The trouble arises when our assessments of potential profit lack imagination. In particular, as group size increases groups have a tendency to focus on  <em>short-term</em> ,  <em>stable</em>  profits. They're easier to defend in debate, and probabilistic investments become risky.</p>
<p>It's not just that ARPA gave us the internet while corporations couldn't. PARC at its peak was similar, and it came out of a for-profit company. I have a hard time imagining DARPA today accomplishing as much, though I'm not an expert.</p>
<p>Power = Resources - Accountability. Sometimes people with power do amazing things. Sometimes they don't.</p>
<p>(Sometimes they're Robert Moses who we thought for decades did amazing things, until Jane Jacobs opened our eyes.)</p>
<p>(I also saw something recently that the rhetoric about companies having to maximize profit is a recent thing, going back perhaps to the 70s: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html">nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html</a>. So while maximizing profit is always a difficult problem, perhaps we've made it harder for ourselves in recent decades by forgetting the value of long-term vision.)</p>

Suffice it to say for this conversation that the profit motive has given us an extremely twisted major use for computing: social media. If profit above all else is the motive, then Facebook/Twitter et al will do whatever it takes to increase their profits. They do this by way of advertising money. The suggestion / content algorithms maximize "user engagement." And since we humans are hard-wired to pay attention to extremes ("if it bleeds, it leads"), the algorithm has no choice but to suggest more and more extreme content. We have witnessed this again and again in mass shootings and in general political divisiveness around the world. This barely scratches the surface.</p>
<p>And if you wonder "why doesn't Facebook do something about it," an internal FB group was instructed to research the extent of FB's influence on extremist activity and came to the conclusion that yes, FB is contributing to global instability and that the best course of action for the benefit of humanity was to fundamentally change FB's business model. Mark Zuckerberg waved the warning aside and told them to never bring it up again.</p>

B2B sales certainly doesn't lend itself to optimal purchasing decisions either, so we are all left waiting for revolutions while the products that we're stuck with gets moderately better over the decades that it's around. More than anything else, the discipline of engineering struggles to find a foothold in computer software, partially because it's so lucrative and powerful that "agile" unscalable tinkering wins out, and partially because making well-engineered software is especially hard in a rapidly transforming medium - at least now it seems Moore's law has migrated to GPUs!</p>
<p>It seems we're stuck with Capital and all that brings, including the systemic drift to low performance that is only corrected by aperiodic paradigm shifts. What's exciting is this community seems as poised as any to offer one! I, and I think most others here, agree with your axiom to make software as free as possible - an important part of that, to me, is to extend that freedom to the end-user even if they aren't a "programmer" in the traditional sense. There are performance and complexity costs associated with that as well as the standard ugliness of proprietary systems, but things seem to be moving in the right direction, and the idea of such a system now isn't pure fantasy. Now, we just have to compete with AI-fueled black boxes that seek to forever murkify precious computing.</p>

<p>I've worked on a number of different systems that you could call a realization of the kind of functional relational programming talked about in Out of the Tar Pit and it definitely didn't seem to be that much better. </p>
<p>The system I worked on most recently was in clojure, with a datalog database for the relational part. </p>
<p>Without going into details, the system has not been a success. Trying to achieve our goals, with reasonable performance was hard. The mapping between the inner frp world and the world around us was messy and lossy. </p>
<p>I think there are many great insights in that paper. But having lived in the clojure space for a while, (a space I love) I've cooled on the paper a bit.</p>

<p>A second deep goal I see here is to reduce the effort of programming. That can help either beginners or experts, but for contrast with the previous one, call it the "raise the ceiling" goal.</p>
<p>My preferred deep goal is to make programs easier for anyone to look inside. "Lower the floor for reading." I'm less concerned about the writing experience.</p>

<p>The way I think about it is programming is a skill that can support any activity. Bending the computer to help with whatever you do. So while some tools are more specific, it seems reasonable to be general-purpose. I'm fairly flexible on the initial product. My plan has always been a small "empire" of little products.

<p>In programming and in my other hobby (philosophy). I’ve found that as I learn more, my tastes change, morph, and expand. What I see in philosophy that I think is wonderful is the incredible diversity of views and yet persistent dialogue going on between these views. Philosophy becomes this rich discussion of trade-offs, of clear conversations driving to find where the true disagreement lies. Programming on the other hand seems to lack this depth.</p>
<p>So if I have a deep goal, it is a meta goal. To explore many different deep goals. To see many different approaches flourish. To push and understand. To find where real disagreement is rather than superficial. To find connections where others see difference.</p>
<p>I think the things that make us different here are much less important than the things we have in common. What I think matters in those difference is to understand them and to find out the strengths in each approach and to find a way, not to combine them all into some multi-paradigm mess, but to see them all from their perspectives.</p>

I do agree that with programming we can’t say where the true disagreement lies. I mean “static types vs dynamic” and “functional vs OO” seem somewhat narrow and fuzzy debates that aren’t quite getting to something rich. Perhaps there are some key notions that could make these discussions feel more crisp? Often I feel I am in this boat as well.. “seeking perspectives” that connect and sever other ideas. What came to mind after reading your reply was</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>Not All Who Wander Are Lost</em> </p>

<p>(I mean.. I know  <em>I</em>  am lost, but not all who wander are.)</p>

<p>Finding useful collaboration (and avoiding unproductive colab) is one reason I’m thinking about this goals stuff.  Another (ulterior) reason is just so I have ideas on how to formulate goals and approaches for myself. Say if each one of us in the community puts the answer to this question on our site.. it may make it easier to know even what one might want to read more of? Since there are many levels of goals, I’m also curious to see how people think about this.</p>

<p>I think my overall goal is to shorten the development loop. Remove everything that is not strictly necessary, this included build tools, but also switching to reactive hot code reloading and other technologies that make iterating much faster. I build on Observable because it solved most of the main issues already, but I was thinking along these lines when I tried to develop a functional reactive animation system called Animaxe in 2016 <a href="https://github.com/tomlarkworthy/animaxe">github.com/tomlarkworthy/animaxe</a></p>
<p>I see observable as the proper realizing of what Animaxe was ineffectively grasping at, so I just need to upgrade Observable to be able to program the things I am interested in i.e. backend programming, hence webcode.run</p>

I’m actually a bit emotional, heh. I have been struggling so.. damn.. hard to find people that can succinctly put in to words the different ways the sides of the programming and development worlds all are trying to converge on one thing: Seeing what the hell you’re doing.</p>
<p>If I may be allowed a minor plug, the <strong>#share-your-work</strong> has a link to my project where I try to tackle this very thing. It’s specifically the idea of viewing  <em>code</em> , but I’m working on finding and building the tools that let you do the analysis - Swift is really, really lacking in this respect so far. That means things like runtime state poking, type lookups and definitions etc, are all gated by the big barrier between the high level language and all the goodies that C provides.</p>
<blockquote><p> In Python there are readily available viz modules, and people use them. They suck because they’re mostly not interactive and are effectively stuck in the 70s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the sentence that does it for me. I feel it viscerally, and I just can’t write, think, or learn fast enough to get my ideas into code.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://webcode.run">Tom Larkworthy</a> Have you used any systems with faster feedback than hot-reloading?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>maybe?</p>
<p>Just to clarify what I mean by hot-code reload vs live-reload. Live reload is a full restart on a program on change, which loses state, vs hot-code reloading where only changed code is reloaded which maintains program state between partial restarts.</p>
<p>But I would say Observable is a little beyond hot-reload because it's also the notebook format so program output and code is interleaved, so it that removes a context switch between IDE and program output and gives you a REPL vibe inline too. But thats as advanced as I have got so far for fast feedback. Can I do better?!</p>

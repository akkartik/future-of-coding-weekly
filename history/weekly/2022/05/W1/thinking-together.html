In some instances the lack of semantic meaning from mutating the dimension, such as order, is "correct", if you want to visually communicate that order is irrelevant. So not using a dimension may be desirable. Making visual interconnections provide more information by providing shapes also runs into problems when using un-typed or dynamically typed language. Doing it in typed languages, you quickly run out of useful shapes. I've seen people try to use color to solve that problem, and it's visually jarring.</p>

Zoom could make all kinds of nested graphs easier to navigate. Vlojure does a version of this.</p>

For example, you might search for a "user", but then refine that search to a "banned user". Note that "banned" and "user" are not necessarily independent tags. Just because someone is a "banned user" and a "father" doesn't mean they're a "banned father" as well. The adjective "banned" could specifically relate to the noun "user".</p>
<p>Or a slightly clearer example: someone who is both a "skilled baker" and a "writer" is not necessarily a "skilled writer".</p>
<p>I'm now wondering whether an understanding of (basic) linguistics is necessary to develop a good tagging system. After all, our mission is to adapt programming languages to the human mind ü§î.</p>

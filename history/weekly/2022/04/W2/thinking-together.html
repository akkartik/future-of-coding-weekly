<p>I came up with the idea of using areas and line segments of 2D shapes as inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>For example, a rectangle gives us addition (the half circumference), multiplication (the area), square root (using area as an input and measuring one of the sides):</p>
<p>(image 1)</p>
<p>One could imagine an iteration construct ala the one in Bret Victors computational drawing program, or similar to the one in Crosscut, that allowed expressing e.g. Fibonacci iteratively:</p>
<p>(image 2)</p>
<p>Here the green arrows connect inputs lines to output lines, and the dots show where line segments begin and end.</p>
<p>The dotted rectangles represent iteration, where the first rectangle is used to specify the relation to previous rectangles (exactly how is a bit vague, I know). The green line sets the distance between each iteration.</p>
<p>Similarly, a unit circle could show the angle as a bent line (in radians, as the circumference is 2*pi), and sin/cos as shown. Using sin/cos as inputs and measuring the bent line you get asin and acos:</p>
<p>(image 3)</p>
<p>Thoughts? Maybe it already exists?</p>

<p>Take your Fibonacci example. I don't think representing addition as the half-perimeter of a rectangle provides me with any intuition or insight here. To me, this particular diagram would be better off if you just stacked the input segments to form the output segment.</p>
<p>Better still might be a Fibonacci spiral construction, as shown below. No clue (offhand) how to represent this construction in a programming system, but it says a lot more, geometrically, than half-perimeters of rectangles /or/ stacked segments.</p>

The freedom to draw "whatever" at the concrete level is really pleasing; being able to manipulate the "whatever" using a dynamic system is appealing. But having vector math be the only way to do that dynamic manipulation is such a narrow channel through which to work ‚Äî it's very unlikely to match the character of the "whatever" you drew.</p>
<p>I'd like to lean away from geometric representation entirely. That means no vector math ‚Äî probably no math at all. I want to see what that dynamic / programming system might look like.</p>

Clojure, on the other hand is generally admired for being more "practical". One of the main things Clojure introduced is vectors <code>[a b c]</code>, and maps <code>{:a b, :c d}</code> as first class syntax. I was reading <a href="https://git.eta.st/eta/intertube/src/branch/master/trackernet.lisp#L93">some Lisp</a> this week and my brain kept grating/complaining because I was seeing what are conceptually hashmaps written as what I was interpreting as a lists of pairs, something which I "know" to be different.</p>
<p>Conversely, I have always thought it was annoying that C++ has three different operators (<code>::</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>) that all essentially mean "member of". Would C# be better if you had to say <code>System::Console.Print()</code> instead of <code>System.Console.Print()</code>? No, I think most people would rarely feel the need to conceptually distinguish between these things, the C++ syntax is just annoying noise to me.</p>
<p>What is it that distinguishes Clojure's brilliant decision to expand the syntax, from C# brilliant decision to compress the syntax?</p>
<p>It implies to me that if there is a scale of simplicity-to-expressiveness, then humans just happen to sit at particular point on it. There's no particular "reason" for why these changes were right other than "they'd gone too far that way, go back this way". There's a local maximum somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about this simplicity-to-expressiveness scale recently as it irrationally annoys me that on WikiData, "instance of" is "just another relationship" (it's <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31">P31</a> - <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27">"citizen of" is P27</a>!).</p>
<p>I think that RDF is far too far towards the "elegance" end of the spectrum and would greatly benefit from a Clojure-style acknowledgement that some things are more different, and should be more differentiated. Yeah, it's mildly interesting that Node-Rel-Node triples is all you need to describe an ontology, but that's not actually how people think about the world...</p>

If you keep two the same you can find a local maximum for the third. But what you learn doing that isn't transferrable to different tasks, tools, and people. And maximizing only one would have to be justified by expecting the other two never to change. It's never just one spectrum, like "elegance". With Clojure and C#, it might be that they were opposite sides of the same local maximum, because the task and people are similar. Maybe not. RDF has a completely different triple, so the lessons aren't transferable, I would expect. I would also say that if a tool doesn't reflect how people think about the world that doesn't necessarily mean there is anything wrong with the tool. It might suggest the utility of another, different tool, aimed at different (or just more) people.</p>

Lists and hash maps do not have the same signature; a list is flat, but there are internal relationships in the arguments to a hashmap. So it helps to have different syntax to remind you of that.</p>

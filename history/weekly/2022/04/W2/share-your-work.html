<p>As for "backsolving," constraint satisfaction is a good way to approach that kind of question.  Read <code>line = plane1 ^ plane2</code> as establishing a constraint.  The semantics of how to fix <code>line</code>, <code>plane1</code>, and <code>plane2</code> depends on an objective function and other constraints.  When read as a definition, you have the implicit constraint that <code>plane1</code> and <code>plane2</code> are already been fixed.  In some contexts, a satisfying way to satisfy constraints is to make them kind of springy.</p>

It's a fount of FoC-relevant ideas. For instance, combining the place where the programming happens with the place where the program runs, but even further using the same tools for building and working inside the program. Also, Crosscut tries to not feel like programming, and present a minimalist interface that is ruthlessly focused on emulating the best aspects of traditional pen &amp; paper. If you haven't taken the time to read the essay, you're.. probably busy, I shouldn't bother you, sorry. I'll just leave a note on the door.</p>
<p>Before working on Crosscut, I had been slowly chipping away at my own FoC project called <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-time-travel/">Hest</a> (yeah, still just that one blog post). I also made a podcast just to think out loud about the project, so that I could self-reflect and thus hone my ideas and goals, and maybe someday build another prototype. But when the Crosscut project started, it drew all my attention, and the podcast stopped.</p>
<p>Today, with Crosscut done and released to the world, I'm here to share a new Hest podcast episode ‚Äî 46 minutes long ‚Äî in which I compare and contrast Crosscut and Hest.</p>
<ul><li>How are their prototypes similar and different?</li><li>What goals do they share and disagree on?</li><li>How has my work on Crosscut shaped my thoughts on visual programming generally?</li><li>What effect will that have as I continue pursuing Hest (or any other FoC projects)?</li></ul><p>To find out, kindly use <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss">this hand-crafted RSS feed</a>, search for Hest or Ivan Reese in your podcast player of choice, or click one of the buttons here: <a href="https://pod.link/1559446316"></a><a href="https://pod.link/1559446316">https://pod.link/1559446316</a></p>
<p>And stay tuned for more episodes. They won't be on a schedule, but they will be about as relevant and entertaining as this fine slack message. So, fifty-fifty, eh? ;)</p>

When thinking of this community, I always place Tofu as more of an attempt at the near-future-of-programming. It does not aim for revolution as much as many of the cool things here (booo incrementalism boo boo).</p>
<p>Anyway, after years of working on it and using it on my own, I want to slowly start letting people in and this community is prime for me there. It is currently an experimental extension for VSCode for structurally yet fluidly editing JS &amp; TS. If you don't have VSCode installed, you can also use it within your browser <a href="https://vscode.dev/github/Gregoor/vscode-tofu-starter/index.ts">here</a> (there should be a pop-up asking if you want to install the Tofu extension). If you do have VSCode, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=watware.tofu-vscode">here's a link to the extension in the marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback of all kinds wanted and welcome (here or over in the <a href="https://github.com/Gregoor/tofu/issues">GH issues</a>)!</p>

<p>How do you know how hard it is to build if you don't know what it is? How do you know the right idea would be well recognized without first being constructed and experienced? How do you know the person with the right idea is also the person who can easily implement all the missing software layers to build it, or to convince others to do so? How do you know if the right idea is something that pops into one's head completely formed, or is instead discovered through an evolutionary process of building, testing, and seeing what feels right and where it leads them?</p>

To "know" what to build is to know what code needs to be written. If you know what code needs to be written, you can simply press all of the correct letters on your keyboard, in the correct sequence, and then you're done.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is: programming is entirely about figuring out what code needs to be written (or modified). That's what I was implying in my last message.</p>
<p>As you say, oftentimes you have to experiment (many, many times) to figure out what code needs to be written. One hardly ever writes the right code on the first try. But writing code (which forces you to deliberate every little detail) is the last step in the design &amp; discovery process.</p>

Actually making the changes to an algorithm or a data model is not too hard, in isolation.</p>
<p>I think data models in practice are typically harder because other code depends on it in a way that I have to understand that other code too. That other code may not even be accessible to me. (A customers codebase for example). Algorithms can have that implication, but not as often.</p>
<p>Since I’m guessing this question is asked partially to motivate which problems to solve, I do think there are ways to tackle this.</p>
<p>First, since others code in my scenario is a blackbox, we can’t just make tools for actually understanding that code, it isn’t accessible. But what we could do is make it easy to explore implications of changes.</p>
<p>Take an algorithm change. Instead of sending a request for every one message, I aggregate every 10 messages and send them. What are the implications of this? What if I never get 10 messages? What if I overflow some bounds? What about retries? Would my accuracy decrees if my failure rate increased? Would this change be effective? Would it reduce my downstream costs?</p>
<p>Consider a data model change. I have data structure A and I want to have data structure B. Is there a bidirectional mapping between them? What will the increase in my storage be? If I need to convert between the two, at what do I need to support? I know that I need X,Y, and Z access patterns. Are those efficient with the new data structure?</p>
<p>All of these things are questions we have to ask ourselves as we are making changes in systems. But we have no way to watch them play out. No way to tweak the parameters.</p>
<p>Really there are two tools trying to help us 1) Whiteboards 2) Formal models.Surely there is a nicer middle ground here.</p>

<p>I know this doesn't account for differences in how easy it is to use the programmability of a given app (mailx is much easier to automate than Gmail) or the importance of individual features that can or cannot be automated, or the ease of integrating applications with different built-in scripting languages, but I think this is a relatively well-defined metric that might still contain some meaning.</p>

<p>Personally, I think mine has trended downwards, and I suspect it has something to do with the increasing roles played in my life by mobile apps, web apps, and services that make their money from advertising and want to maximize user engagement rather than productivity.</p>

<p>Even on programmable devices the picture feels worse. Every single open source project has gotten larger and more complex and harder to build over the last 20 years. Pine is defunct, but observe:</p>

<p>Emacs in 2022: 405kLoC C, 1.25MLoC lisp, 1780 lisp DEFUNs defined in C, 42k defuns defined in lisp</p>
<p>This is pretty blunt, of course. I'm just counting <code>DEFUN</code> in the <code>src/</code> directory and <code>^(defun </code> in the <code>lisp/</code> directory. Let me know if there's a more accurate approach. But my impression is that Emacs pays so much attention to backwards compatibility that you are able to ignore new affordances for add-ons and customization until you need to go find something.</p>
<p>For completeness:</p>
<p>Vim: 275kLoC in 2006 (v7.0) -&gt; 390kLoC now</p>
<p>Neovim: 167kLoC in 2015 (v0.1.0) -&gt; 238kLoC now</p>
<p>Very interesting that Neovim is smaller now than Vim was in 2006.</p>
<p>tl;dr - <code>sloccount</code> is a useful tool!</p>

I do look at Emacs source code (the Lisp part) quite often, but I get there by navigating from my own code to layers below. As long as the number of layers I have to go through doesn't increase, the size of the Lisp code is irrelevant for me.</p>
<p>As you note, Emacs values backwards compatibility highly, which is something I do care about. Perhaps even more importantly, Emacs values programmability, and therefore offers good support for exploring its own source code.</p>
<p>So a good metric would perhaps be "number of navigation steps until you hit a primitive" (which for Emacs would be a function implemented in C)&gt;</p>

But if you're just using the elisp primitives, the surface area of names (which I'm estimating by counting <code>defun</code>s) does seem to grow a bit slower than the total volume of Emacs code.</p>

I suppose Emacs' size made a jump when org-mode was adopted into the core distribution, but this had no impact on people not using org-mode. They could (still can) simply ignore it.</p>

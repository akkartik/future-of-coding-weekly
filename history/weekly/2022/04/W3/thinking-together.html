In recent years more and more sharding solutions are implemented you can see that with polkadots parachain model, Cosmos, RChain , Cardano,  even in the Ethereum Ecosystem there are are many "satelite" Efforts like Gnosis Chain. These Efforts point not only to technical difficulties but in my opinion its a cultural thing. Human beings are not like a global bee hive cluster, or bork cluster for that matter. We have distinct cultural and local history backgrounds. We are still looking for ways to express this with technology and its accompanying patterns of behaviour ( what seymour papert called computing cultures)</p>

some short experience report dOrg from the US
paragraph head lines:
There is no management team, and everyone owns the company
Developers choose their own projects and control their own budgets
The company outsources health benefits
Conflicts are mediated and then voted on.
Salaries are transparent
Skill-building is still a work-in-progress.
==========&amp;gt;
My question for you: What do you think about this? Would you work for a DAO? Why would you not? Why would you? Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

I once tried to point out to the unison people that at the ethereum dev0 conference in berlin 2015 there was a talk/proposal to create a dev environment not unlike to what they have build now. But they weren't really interested in looking for connections to that space. Of course a projects needs supporters to supports its identity. But remember when I talked about self-awareness?  Some DAO and other projects in the web3 space now realize that: There is a significant importance on how you build and its not so much important what actually you build. Eventually these two form a living relationship, but it is the awareness of that relationship that can change our(humans) relationship to technology. I'm curious how, if and when eventually all these communities will touch each other eventually.</p>

<p>... my own project (the <a href="http://Object.Network"></a><a href="http://Object.Network">http://Object.Network</a> ) has two core attributes: Declarativeness and Decentralisation which I think correspond to these two elements in the OP (FoC and Distributed). Both capital-"D"s derive from a single deeper concept: the Big Inversion ðŸ˜®</p>
<p>That basically entails turning the current, pervasive "code-on-the-outside-data-on-the-inside" programming model inside out: thus "data-on-the-outside-code-on-the-inside".  This means data is freed from the traps of Imperative, Service-Oriented architectures.</p>
<p>And the opposite of an Imperative, Service architecture? A Declarative, Decentralised architecture, of course!</p>
<p>In this programming model, you see and interact with data first - before functions, like in a spreadsheet; it has "internal behaviour" (Declarative).  Imperative is "how over what"; Declarative is "what over how" - the detailed mechanisms of behaviour are hidden behind a declaration - i.e., more data - of the required behaviour. It's basically like a virtual world of data - if you enter Minecraft, you see stuff before you see its behaviour - things are internally-animated.</p>
<p>In the Object Network, all our stuff is sewn together into a kind of Metaverse, using links between data chunks. Data is held locally (Decentralised), so that we have full control over it, instead of imperative data-wrapping, techie programs and Big Tech services.</p>

Yes, we can implement decorators with macros etc, but that's just one small feature related to this area.</p>

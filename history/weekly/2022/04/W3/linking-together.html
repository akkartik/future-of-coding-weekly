I would argue Light Table would qualify - it was used daily by 50k+ people and downloaded 1M+ times. It's ideas found their way into Xcode, Chrome dev tools, VSCode, IntelliJ, etc. So while I imagine it doesn't see much continued use today, it definitely went out into the world and was finished enough to be the daily driver of many folks that weren't us.</p>

<p>For what its worth, when I say "finished" I just mean usable by someone other than me. So light table most assuredly qualifies. In fact, I think light table is almost certainly in the top 10 (if not #1) of the most successful "future of coding style" projects out there.</p>

That creates a temptation to teach for the test, etc.</li></ul><p>Lately I tend to think of the tech company notion of "culture" as "things people do without being directly incentivized to do them." I wonder if there's value in chasing profit but not too closely. The problem, of course, is that this is not very actionable. How do you create a metric for "how closely someone tracks a metric"?</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't think it's a negative correlation exactly. There is often some overlap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those two statements don't conflict üòõ Negative correlation just means that I get paid more for the things that are less valuable, not that the things I get paid for have zero or negative value.</p>
<p>Often the tradeoff is very explicit eg if I publish in paid newsletter instead of on an open website, fewer people get value from it but I get to capture some of that value. Similarly for proprietary vs open-source code. The system actively encourages me to make things less useful.</p>

The culture of a place is the set of behaviors that are rewarded and punished.</p>
<p>It's not the mission statement, charter, or list if values. It's not what the CEO says.</p>

<p>Many of the things I think of in the category of "things you do without being incentivized" include not penalizing things that there are no legible incentives for.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can reward and incentivize people for not chasing profit too closely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge is that a company has objective functions fractally at all levels. Profit at the company level is influenced by people chasing their own objective functions too tightly.</p>
<p>Tying it back to my original statement about capitalism, the inside of a firm isn't that different from the space between firms in this respect. Long-term value is often generated in the spaces between legible incentives. Chasing <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a> too closely can be self-limiting.</p>

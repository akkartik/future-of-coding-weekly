<p>I mean in terms of impact on our lives. On our future. A piece of transformative UX design and engineering work that was done‚Äîwithout any chance of knowing how massive it would become.</p>
<p>I think hyperlinks are bigger than the Internet. The Internet isn't the Internet without hyperlinks. Yes, hyperlinks don't work without a running internet, but the Internet isn't "the thing", it's "the thing that let us create the (many exciting) things".</p>
<p>It's wild to think that once the idea of hyperlinks formed, the UX design that arose was the application of text color and an underline. With that, semantic color and an underline, we got:</p>
<p>Hyperlinks as sharing.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks as social currency.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks as digital neural connections.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks as the connective tissue of civilization.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks as the most transformative tool in use by humans today?</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, cats had this planned out all along üòÅ</p>

<p>It's remarkable how often people online don't link to those they are arguing against, or even give the name of the person or publication they're criticizing, because they don't want to "promote" the web site or account of their intellectual opponent.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to follow many of the most important social dialogs in our culture, and makes it easy to commit straw man fallacies when one is concealing the original text being criticized.</p>
<p>Treating hyperlinks as social currency has also encouraged an explosion of link spam that has made search engines much less useful than they were 10-20 years ago.</p>
<p>Also, the epidemic of broken links means that knowledge keeps being lost at a frightening rate, which makes the shift away from paper dangerous because it so dramatically increases the danger of any given piece of knowledge being lost.</p>
<p>So yes, hyperlinks are awesome, but we haven't perfected them yet. Not by a long shot.</p>

A "better" solution is likely much more complicated, maybe 10X, which hinders adoption and "I just created a link using Notepad" kinds of UX.</p>
<p>How would Hyperlinks 2.0 work? How much of the internet and other enabling technologies would have to change and be improved?</p>
<p>A few things that came to mind as I read your comment:</p>
<ul><li>Semantics for a link, e.g. to enable links with semantics such as "counter argument" instead of blindly being "social currency". Maybe the identity of the linker needs improvements as well.</li><li>Versioning/snapshotting of linked-to resource to prevent dead links, but how to reconcile that with the distributed nature of the Internet and dynamic pages?</li></ul><p>A lot of added complexity, which makes it interesting to think about, but also super challenging in terms of what the adoption story looks like.</p>

<p>I suspect something like Xanadu built on something like IPFS would be a good starting point, but it would require the ability to index documents not just by their own hashes, but also by the hashes of files for which they describe links and files for which they contain updates.

<ul><li>The greatest human minds invented informatics to allow them parallel interaction with shared knowledge. They knew that knowledge is a dynamic semantic network and network is a set of nodes interconnected by links.  <em>So of course yes, links are hyper... important</em>  üôÇ See also, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As we may think</a> (Vannevar Bush, 1945). A practical implementation of such a system was <a href="https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY">NLS created by Douglas Engelbart</a>, who spent decades on trying and failing to explain <a href="https://youtu.be/_OSspHZICOg">what it means for any human organisation</a>.</li><li>The focus moved towards text-oriented environments because it was easier to <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#3b4">explain</a> and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262120166/libraries-of-the-future/">measure</a> (also because it separated the syntax from the model it describes, but that's another story). So, instead of working on shared mutable networks (that  <em>is</em>  knowledge), we turned to texts (a serialized, final form of a current knowledge) that can refer to other texts. The competing ideas of referring were Dr. Ted Nelson's transclusion in Xanadu and Sir Tim Berners-Lee's implementation of hyperlinks. The second was simpler and more acceptable by business that could not handle <a href="https://xanadu.com/tco/index.html">transcopyright</a>, so it became the de facto standard. The much better Xanadu failed for 50 years because it contains three fundamental flaws, ironically the cure was there in Dr. Nelson's other idea, the Zigzag database all the time (but that's another story).</li><li>As a conclusion, the current thinking of links is that they point to, and sometimes into a stream. If you see it written in a sentence, it tells you why it does not work: this approach can't handle changes and versioning. That requires an opposite approach, accepting that knowledge is a constantly changing network of which we create persistent snapshots and through the links you must be able to see the momentary state and navigate through the changes. Of course, this is much more complicated than books, this is why computers are still just paper-simulators - but <a href="https://youtu.be/KdnGPQaICjk">Dr. Nelson is much better at explaining it</a>.  <em>Those damned cats!</em></li></ul><p> <em>That's my (bit more than) 2 cents.</em> </p>

By definition, the second is more popular but at the same time much less reliable... Or in other words: Xanadu would support the hard work of learning and contributing to our common improvement, while the current hypermedia supports acting smart, "creating popular content".

<p>In a way, that's a symptom of the mess that the tech world has become. As <strong>@Lorand Kedves</strong> nicely summarizes in the beginning of his "science of being wrong".</p>
<p>My analysis of this mess is "too much interaction". If you look back at the history of technology, on a century-to-millenium timescale, it has relied on a equilibrium of tinkerers, scientists, and engineers all taking inspiration from each other but mostly working according to their own logics, solving the problems they most care about. In today's tech world, tinkerers dominate so much that scientists and engineers can no longer do their long-term work of identifying fundamental concepts and principles and of developing mature technologies. The tinkerer's ecosystem churn and low-reliability products are not a solid basis to build on, and require so much attention just to keep running that society has no attention (and resources) left for long-term study and design.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone somewhere is working on ideas like Xanadu, but if that someone is actually productive, they have isolated themselves so much from our tech world that we are unlikely to ever hear from them.</p>

I‚Äôd have to politely disagree about the point on language servers. I‚Äôve tried interactive development and I think it‚Äôs a valid set of tradeoffs but not my personal cup of tea. </p>
<p>Tree sitter generating C is probably the right call, but I would be interested to see if generating Rust or Zig would be worthwhile, as you could keep the C ABI but make the build process way way easier. I‚Äôve been trying to compile a rust codebase with tree-sitter to wasm and because of the C code, I can‚Äôt compile to wasm32-wasi without some messy patching, and wasm32-unknown-emscripten appears to be going out of date and has ABI incompatibilities with Rust compiled to wasm. If tree-sitter could generate rust it‚Äôd make the composability a lot nicer.</p>
<p>As for your last point, yeah fair. I‚Äôll try to come up with good examples. Bison has quite poor documentation and an extremely poor dev experience but you‚Äôre right, I need to iron that out concretely. Racket is almost worth an entire blog post on its own. I like it a lot but it‚Äôs kind of too large and encompassing of an ecosystem to simply be a tool inside a compiler. You either use racket or you don‚Äôt. </p>
<p>Thanks again! </p>

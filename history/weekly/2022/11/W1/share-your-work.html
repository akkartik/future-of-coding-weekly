The rhythm, in both the audio and the video, is very compelling. How did you fall onto this idea of making the demonstrations valuable art, in their own right? Do you have advice for people who aspire to be this compelling in how they demonstrate their experiments?</p>

It's really been an iterative thing - my <a href="https://youtu.be/zLP4ZwudAKs">first video</a> was quite different+basic üôÇ</p>
<p>and with each video, I've experimented a bit more!</p>
<p>I covered the journey a little bit in <a href="https://youtu.be/nER7-DVLEjA">this video</a>!</p>
<p>I guess my backgrounds in performing+teaching influence my videos a little bit, among <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/KnowPond/blob/main/influences.md">a lot of other influences</a>! I go to quite a few trance gigs, and the v<a href="https://youtu.be/oUq9Io3hXKc">isuals they use alongside the music</a> is a big influence too! (as well as the common combination of <a href="https://youtu.be/IrzO9GqS8BY">nature+electronic music</a>)</p>
<p>My advice would be: Make a lot of stuff for fun, and try one new thing each time (no more, no less)!</p>

Between storyboarding, scripting, producing, editing, it took the better part of a week, and it just felt so inefficient. I think I might need a different medium, or a more compelling target. Or maybe just more practice. But I will try new things, and try to incorporate other esthetics that I value.</p>

I feel like I go in cycles - sometimes I'm trying to be more ambitious, and sometimes I'm just trying to make the video more quickly! üí®</p>
<p>The only other thing I would add is that: The main thing I aim for with the demos/videos is to give the user a certain feeling, rather than give them some knowledge/information. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's what I always focus on as goal number 1!</p>

After a 5 month break, we have resumed our activities.</p>
<p>We haven't officially released the product yet, but I have written a draft of introductory articles. I would be happy to hear your feedback.</p>

There's a lot of stuff in the draft that feels like far-future goals. I'd like to see more writing about the thing you've actually built. What would I use it to do? What other things is it most similar to? How does it differ from them?</p>
<p>You've already got some things that  <em>seem</em> like they'd answer these questions. For instance, you have:</p>
<blockquote><p>Desk is: [...] A coding environment for the next 100 years. It blurs the line between living and coding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I don't know what that even means, so it doesn't actually answer the question "What is Desk?"</p>

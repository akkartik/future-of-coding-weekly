I often feel that if the editing sucks, the whole project just won‚Äôt feel nice. But recreating a decent text editor (by this typically mean for code) is always a reasonably big undertaking.</p>
<p>What I‚Äôve started working on is a headless editor. There are some that exist like xi, but I‚Äôm aiming for something a bit simpler. Right now I‚Äôm dealing with proper cursor and multi-cursor support. I‚Äôm going to be working on a few implementations for textbuffers. Going to add treestyle undo and redo. Going to get syntax highlighting working. </p>

<p>While not headless (and perhaps I should have made that split more obvious), it does separate the buffer management from the rendering (which can be either ImGui or Qt).</p>
<p>I wrote lots of little unit tests, which I found invaluable when things got complicated and I didn't want to break stuff.</p>

<p>This is another ImGui based editor; it is in a single file; although it has a UI, there is much in there to do with handling standard editing modes &amp; syntax highlight; you might find it useful.</p>
<p>FWIW: in my day job I work on source editors &amp; some UI parts of debuggers too.  But we use Scintilla under the covers (<a href="https://www.scintilla.org/">scintilla.org</a>).  It is a pain to integrate, but it has a lot of features.  We use another layer on top of it, since our tools are Qt based.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure exactly the shape it will take, but I want it to be fairly lightweight yet customizable. Customization though would come from using the parts differently, not configuring things.

Pensieve's 2D surface isn't actually very good at giving me a sense of space like say <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone">inkandswitch.com/capstone</a>. I just spent some time trying to cross-link stories far apart in space and blowing my stack, copying ids laboriously into a scratch space outside pensive, then pasting it into hyperlinks in the right place in pensieve.</p>
<p>Then I realized, I should just use new kinds of links. The value of hyperlinks is when they're inline, whereas links just line up at the bottom of each note. But I currently can't linkify arbitrary text anyway. (<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/">Potluck</a> style automation might help me get there.) For now, links are the best way to do hyperlinks in Pensieve. I also get back-links for free.</p>

<p>That said, I see the space of what is often called "end user programming" as really two spaces: "domain expert programming", and "daily life progrmaming". The latter is to-dos, shopping lists, smart home automation, writing letters, etc. The realm of HyperCard.</p>
<p>These two categories almost coincide with desktop vs. smartphone use today.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed but also <strong>@William Taysom</strong> showed in another channel, Open AI - Chat Gpt seems to generate a lot of buzz. </p>

<p>Looking at this I‚Äôm questioning myself if ‚Äúframework‚Äù rewrites will be less common in the industry now?</p>
<p>Will it have a deeper impact than this?</p>
<p>Is this a development in the lines of Peter Novig‚Äôs - as we may program?</p>

<p>A feedback loop could result in a quick improvement to these systems.  I've just looked at dozens of Twitter threads where people prompt engineer ChatGPT into giving extremely good answers.  Use that as training data and in short order, this software could be as uncanny at answering questions as... as... a well trained 20 question answering AI.  For example <a href="http://www.20q.net/">20q.net</a> guessed "koala" correctly with my son a moment ago despite him saying a koala weighs less than a duck and would be a good gift, which 20Q says it did not expect.</p>

<ul><li><p>Programming, like all automation, is an amplifier for decisions. This makes it difficult to foresee the consequences of the decisions, and that is the root cause of all the trouble humanity has had with industrialization and now with computing.</p>
<ol start="2"><li><p>In the interest of safety, decision amplification requires one of</p>
<p> a. a limited scope of automation (sandboxing, ...)</p>
<p> b. regular validation of execution by an agent that has an incentive not to do harm (liability, ...)</p>
<p> c. provable predictability of consequences (matematical proof, ...)</p>
</li></ol></li></ul><p>So... which amplifiable decisions can we safely delegate to today's AIs? I'd say none. So the questions becomes: how do AIs need to evolve so that we can safely delegate amplifiable decisions to them?</p>

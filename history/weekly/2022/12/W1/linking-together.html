<p>For those who haven't heard, Inkbase was a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/szymon_k">Szymon Kaliski</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/qualmist">Joshua Horowitz</a> and James Lindenbaum. They prototyped a programmable drawing tool which unified some of the nice qualities of dynamic software with the tactility and freedom of good ol' pen and paper. It was the precursor to <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/">Crosscut</a> and the upcoming Untangle. All three projects were featured in Szymon's excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifYuvgXZ108">Strange Loop talk</a> this year.</p>

<p>I wish that like the e-ink Remarkable/Onyx set would decide to be the next Apple, swoop in and say "these will all come together into the next star trek computer we're making, watch this" (oh yeah and "we'll stick to the local-first, malleable principles because they're right on")</p>

No, this isn't a link to a parser library or a tech conference or a blog post about concatenative langs. But to me this is just as interesting and relevant when pondering what the future of programming ought to be.</p>
<p>For instance, one could think about borrowing this aesthetic, or  <em>an</em> aesthetic. What would it take for a code visualization to make use of detailed geometry and lighting/shading/depth cues and other expressively artistic aspects like the ones on display here? At the moment, code "visualizations" tend to consist of line graphs, grids of numbers, flat little circles with text centred in them, straight lines or simple s-curves, all rendered without light. The way we visualize code isn't even, like,  <em>Gourad shaded</em> . And here we see something that crams incredible detail and depth into every pixel. The  <em>images</em>  themselves aren't of interest ‚Äî if someone wants to make a programming language out of skulls and leaves and reefs, my god, go as hard as you can! But for my money, it's the way these  <em>semi-</em> abstract shapes are given an impression of tactility and physicality that interests me most.</p>
<p>Another angle would be to think about the process. Mikael generated these images using an AI. I find myself wondering "what if this aesthetic, but for structured data?" (When I say "structured data", I mean source code, cyclomatics, spreadsheets, pages in a book, ASTs, whatever you want.) Perhaps one way to approach answering that question would be exploring the space with the help of an AI. You don't need to come up with something perfect, just something worth running with. We're programmers, so we have a sense of what structured data is  <em>in our bones</em> . That probably limits our thinking. It helps to get someone outside the field, someone whose bones are data-hollow, to <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md">reflect your thoughts back at you in their own language</a>. I'm sure one of the Oblique Strategies is "Ask an AI to do it".</p>

Which is not to say you couldn't employ it for aesthetic purposes, but I can't think of how you would use high-res detail like that for representing the semantics of a program. (There are those digram heatmaps you see in binary analysis and the like, but I'd put those in a different category, certainly more syntactic). To be a little more precise, it will be hard to make small details meaningful in proportion to their visual weight, neither too small (hiding things) or too big (distracting). Similar for 2d topology vs whatever passes for topology in a program.</p>
<p>Maybe that's an angle to approach the question: how do you visually represent something small but impactful like a logical negation? A region with visually changed properties, maybe different color?</p>
<p>You could use visual texture as an information channel in a broadly discrete visualization, in a similar role to color. Definitely needs a careful hand to avoid horrible visual clashing, but if you're really clever you might even be able to weaponize it to make bad patterns look bad.</p>
<p>Organic-looking shapes would be cool, no clarity problem as long as they're distinct. Is there a way to make subtle changes in the outline of an object meaningful? My FSM node is kind of bean-shaped because... something.</p>
<p>Visual media are really high-bandwidth, and programs are pretty low-bandwidth. The way you get lots of data from a small program is by running it, maybe a bunch of times, so maybe incorporating runtime data into the visualization is the key. When you look at the code, you're also looking at all possible runs/outputs. Flame graphs are already in that region, but still resolutely rectangle-based.</p>
<p>Only marginally related: I would like to see a continuous visualization for music/audio creation, where you sort of paint in (time, frequency) space, e.g. chords are parallel lines running along time. I feel like that has to exist, right?</p>

The trick with any good visualization is making important features of the domain pop in the diagram.  When you say "[size] emphatically [does not matter] for anything close to math or logic," I can only assume you have in mind the fact that a small change to an expression "like a logical negation" has a big impact.  However, if the visualization  <em>is</em>  faithful to the effect on, say the shape of possible runs of a program, then a negation can cause part of that shape to change significantly.</p>
<p>As for non-aesthetic smoothing, well the simplest example I can think of is using a line of best fit as a summary for a bunch of datapoints.   In cases of strong correlation, you can mostly ignore underlying points.</p>
<p>I've got a good musical example handy of the interplay of continuity, aesthetics, and emphasized dimensions.  Here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMtjlaDEMdI">youtube.com/watch?v=OMtjlaDEMdI</a> smalin diagrams a performance of the Art of Fugue, which has, more or less, one repeating structure subject, primarily using a fancy piano roll with horizontal for time, vertical for pitch, and color for voice.  Sometimes the subject is delimited using a sort of axis L.  Starting at 1:00:46, he tries something a little different.</p>

I think what <a href="http://github.com/andrewf">Andrew F</a> meant was that a function from logical expressions into logical expressions (notably the substitution function) is not continuous (whatever it means, you'd have to provide a metric on logical expressions). Since programming as done today is performed basically only using substitution (everything can be modelled by untyped lambda calculus), there's no point in trying to make visualisations continuous. Therefore, it makes more sense to give the colours more of an "algebraic" meaning, which I think is what he describes in the mid-to-latter part.</p>

<p>Another approach: what kinds of useful information exists about structured data that can be expressed in such a detailed, real-number-oriented way?</p>
<p>Statistical summary is an interesting angle for structured data, like <strong>@William Taysom</strong> mentioned with regression. Summary, being inherently lossy but still useful, seems like a good way to get useful fuzzy data from structured data. Like if the representation of a database table gave you a pretty good idea of the distributions of its columns. Can you have a good graphical representation of the row that just stacks in the z-axis (with transparency) to get a passable summary? Can something like that work for less regular structures? (Of course this kind of merges with showing summarized runtime results if it goes far enough.)</p>

<p> <em>Apple are pursuing perfection, but should they be?</em> </p>

<blockquote><p>Apple have produced a series of beautifully near-perfect products - honed, polished, focused,  <em>designed</em>  to be "one-reading-only". For this, their team is rightly lauded I think. However, as a result of this near-perfection, the effect of each slip will be grossly amplified, as each product feels so  <em>finished</em>  that users don't think they can adapt; they don't feel part of a process of evolution. Apple need to find a way of retaining their quite brilliant pursuit of simplicity and attention to detail whilst also enabling change in their products -  <em>visibly</em>  enabling adaptation and seeing design as an experiential process after point of sale. In this way, they'd not only engage a generation who need a way in to technology, but nurture a generation who want to get involved in the product, modifying it over time.</p>

<p>...since adaptation is <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/2001monkey.jpg">what sets us apart</a>, adaptive design is the only design strategy which will enable these increasingly sophisticated devices to remain truly meaningful.</p>

Maybe their hardware and software look pretty, but they're a UX nightmare.

I was an Android user for many years, but actually trying an iPhone got me convinced. The breathtakingly simple design of icon on desktop = installed app. The folders that show what's inside when they're closed. Consistent navigation between apps. The lack of preinstalled third party apps. The proper app isolation. The consistent design throughout the whole OS and hardware.</p>

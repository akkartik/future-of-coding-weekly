Programmers only have domain expertise in programming, not in running medical offices, nor accountancies, nor ...  I use(d) a book-writing tool called ‚ÄúScrivener‚Äù.  One of its selling points is that it was not created by programmers.  Having experience with software, I see all sorts of warts in Scrivener, but, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to invent Scrivener.  Spreadsheets, Hypercard, VB, etc., etc. are like gateway drugs.  Non-programmers used these tools to express automated versions of their processes.  Later, expert programmers cleaned up the ad-hoc messes.  This effect can even be seen in programming itself.  The ‚Äúexperts‚Äù tell everyone to use FP, recursion, monads, etc., etc., but the majority of ‚Äúreal programmers‚Äù prefer HTML, JS, Python, Perl, etc.  There /should/ be a huge market for enabling invention, but, it must not appear to be complicated, nor expensive.</p>
<p>Borland targeted developers and disappeared.  VisiCalc did not target developers and its ideas morphed into Excel, etc.  Did the VisiCalc company have an exit strategy or was it simply overtaken by newer versions of the ideas? (idk).</p>
<p>The inventions came from so-called non-programmers.</p>

<p>I wouldn't think about the Future of Coding in terms of "apps". An app is a hard boundary that discourages interoperability and thus inhibits creativity/flexibility in programming. This is by design: companies want to lock you into using and paying for the programs they <u> write and the services they </u> provide. There's no commercial incentive to break down the artificial boundaries.</p>
<p>Apps aren't natural. CPUs don't execute apps ‚Äî they execute instructions. Apps are a result of companies trying to adapt the notion of a  <em>product‚Äî</em> something you can put into a box and sell to a customer‚Äîinto the digital realm. In fact, until the late 2000s, most apps were literally sold in physical boxes with a price tag attached.</p>
<p>The Future of Coding is  <em>not</em>  about encouraging companies (in vain) to allow their users to make modifications to the apps they sell. At least, not if I have anything to say about it. Software should feel like a continuous fluid, not a collection of impenetrable boxes that have small holes for a user's data to trickle in and out.</p>

I just now realized that the language I'm using knows how to deal with multiple worlds, and five different truth values are possible in each, but no one has ever built a user interface for collecting structured data that way!

I'm intrigued by the idea of more humanistic thinking being represented in computational interfaces -- but can't quite wrap my head around why this is a gap in current user interfaces.</p>
<p>Is it, for example, a pesto recipe --  <code>definitely</code>  basil and garlic,  <code>maybe</code>  pinenuts,  <code>maybe</code>  walnuts,  <code>maybe</code>  parmesan,  <code>not</code>  ginger? Is every other option that's not  <code>definitely</code>  and not  <code>definitely-not</code>  a possible  <code>maybe</code> ? Or is  <code>maybe</code>  in fact a  <code>suggested-maybe</code>  and not an  <code>unknown-maybe</code> ? i.e. parmesan is a valuable  <code>maybe</code>  in pesto and worth calling out, while anchovies are not... but they're not a  <code>definitely-not</code> !</p>

<p>b) I have very strong opinions about VPLs.  #1 is that I stay away from VPLs and go for the middle road - a hybrid of text+diagrams+overlapping (anti-grid-based languages, like just about all text-based languages).  SVG seems to have more than what is needed (rects, ellipses, lines, text, (x,y)).  #2 is that you need to think 0D+Simultaneity (AKA Concurrency (0D == zero dependency)) to draw sensible diagrams of programs.</p>
<p>c) No, I don‚Äôt know of any IDE that makes VPL construction uncomplicated enough to use.  I roll my own.</p>

In limited experience with IIRC Jupyter, I remember having to think a lot about cell dependencies and cache invalidation, which would have been prohibitive if the cells had been laid out in every direction. If all that stuff is automatic, then you can get away with making data flow less brutally visible.</p>

So on the rephrasing, it's the second half.  How can there be "other inputs" not included in the list of "all inputs"?  (I mean there is more than one way to try to interpret "other" here.)  What follows doesn't "the same result as if you had asked the original program whether the inputs were valid" help.  Here "the" is ambiguous since we're talking about all the ones that led to a given output  <em>and</em>  other inputs too.</p>

I neglected to mention that the answers from the first question are abstract, expressed as constraints. For example, if your code is the rules of Rock Paper Scissors, your first abstract query might be "how can someone win a two player game", and the abstract answers are in the form " the first player throws rock, and the second player throws scissors, and the first player wins". That would be one of the three possible abstract models that answer the hypothetical query. Now I know William and Jason played a game, and I know William threw rock. If what I want to know is who won a game, I have two options. I can run the same query again against the rules, with the concrete facts I have, and ask it to presume only that Jason threw something. Or, I can attempt to unify against the abstract models returned by the first query. Either way, the same two results will be returned. The one where Jason threw scissors, and the one where Jason threw paper. The complexity of the first query is exponential with regard to the complexity of the rules and the number of hypothetical inputs. The complexity of the second query is linear with the number of models I got from the first one, and exponential with the number of hypothesized inputs only. All the complexity that comes from the rules is avoided. I think. Maybe. üòÇ</p>

<p>The advantage of talking about the ‚Äúmodels‚Äù like you have here is that matching against a given one is easy.  The disadvantage is that most programs, even not very interesting programs, are associated with a large number.  So you‚Äôre better off using a more compact formalism.  Probabilistic graphical models come to mind.</p>
<p>Often there‚Äôs a sweet spot where rules in the code are relatively simple and the data structures encode irregularity without being too big.  I shared a good example the other day.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a grid of squares and each square can be part of a path.  So seven labels: ‚îó,  ‚îÅ, ‚îì, ‚îõ, ‚îÉ, ‚îè, and blank.  You want to enumerate all closed loops.  You can simplify the problem by increasing the grid size to just represent horizontal edges, vertical edges, and intersections.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Yoneda Lemma formalizes the idea that you can characterize a thing by its relationships to similar things.  In practice you can use it to help figure out the right category of similar things or the right features to characterize or both simultaneously.</p>

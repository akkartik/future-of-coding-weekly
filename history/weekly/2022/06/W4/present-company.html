We're building a low-code platform for internal tools, based on what we think is the key technique for democratizing computing - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_by_example">Programming by Example</a>.  There's a ton of promising products that use this technique, from Excel macros to OSX macros to RPA.  Plato is perfecting it for web apps.</p>
<p>We're hiring our first designer to help us build the many novel interaction patterns we need.  If you know someone great, I can offer a $10K referral bonus in cash or equity: <a href="https://jobs.plato.io/founding-designer-at-plato">jobs.plato.io/founding-designer-at-plato</a></p>
<p>I'd also love to chit chat with anyone interested in our approach! DM me!</p>

The idea is that actions in the game can have real world effects, like turning on the lights. (Gig is US-only unfortunately, due to grant funding restrictions).</p>
<p>Prototype overview:</p>
<ul><li>basic single player 2D platformer mechanics (move, jump, item/platform interactions)</li><li>browser based interface built with PixiJS or Three.js</li><li>deployed on local network; server controls light bulbs via LIFX LAN API</li><li>remappable keyboard/mouse controls</li><li>three short levels showing basic navigation, control of in-game lights, and control of LIFX lights</li><li>basic in-game level editor mode</li></ul><p>We‚Äôre looking for someone who‚Äôs handy with a WebGL framework like PixiJS or Three.js. Even though this prototype will be fairly simple, experience developing &amp; deploying a fast-paced multiplayer game is a plus, as it‚Äôs important for interactions to be fluid and game state/networking to be robust. If the future of coding tie-in isn‚Äôt immediately apparent, don‚Äôt worry I can talk your ear off about that üòÑ. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested or know someone who might be!

<p>Hello everyone! </p>
<p>Y Combinator is starting a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/announcing-startup-school-2022">Startup School cohort</a> on Monday, June 27th, and it would be amazing to have a Startup Accountability Group focused on Dev Tools.</p>
<p>If you're also an early founder looking for your first users, raising money or planning to launch your MVP, we'll be meeting weekly to keep each other accountable and share feedback on our progress. We'd love for you to join even if you're not participating in the classes!</p>
<p>Join us by sending me a message or filling this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/TjfKaGs9BYoDTEGx5">forms.gle/TjfKaGs9BYoDTEGx5</a></p>
<p>And don't forget to register for Startup School!</p>
<p>And if you want to help organize the group, or you're past the ‚Äúearly founder‚Äù phase and want to provide mentorship, please reach out to me!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

I myself currently use a hybrid-canvas based approach where the wires are drawn using the konva library (canvas wrapper) and I calculate the controlpoints for the curves in custom code. For the nodes themselves I use react. To get higher performance I do direct manipulation of elements using references to elements (a lot of useRef usage in react). </p>

I have plans todo a big rewrite/refactor and will use this library as an inspiration source. I dont want to use the library myself because I want to try keep the dependencies limited and also be in control as much as possible. One thing that I do wonder:</p>
<p>Svg is used here and not canvas. Performance is still very good there. Do you think svg is better performance wise for node and wire interfaces in a web interface?</p>

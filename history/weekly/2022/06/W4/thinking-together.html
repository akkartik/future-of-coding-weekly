<p>The specification is declarative but the data arrives incrementally. Due to the huge maintenance issues of trying to upgrade state on an incremental streaming solution, I tend to recommend just recomputing from scratch every X mins and throw horizontal compute at it (e.g. BigQuery). The system remains stateless then, plus you always need the from scratch computation anyway to recover from disaster, so it's the first thing to do anyway.</p>

<p>Back in the day, folks like Dijkstra, Hoare, Wirth, Knuth, and Naur did a lot of work on figuring out how to write imperative programs that did what they were intended to do.</p>
<p>However, nowadays, I get the impression that much of the energy being spent on making programs better is focused on alternative ways to structure programs, like object oriented design, distributed and/or parallel and/or concurrent, event driven, reactive, etc. However, most of these design disciplines still involve executing chunks of imperative code, they just involve new and different ways of deciding which imperative code runs when.</p>
<p>This may be a dull and boring idea, but is it possible that part of what we need in order to improve software is wider distribution and study of the old ways of writing correct imperative programs, so that more of the little chunks of imperative code that get executed during an object oriented or event driven program will do what they are supposed to do?</p>

<p>However, what certainly happens in all paradigms (even functional and logic) is that inbetween ‚Äúcybernetical parts‚Äù (parts that do stuff: function applications, rules, statements, message sends, ‚Ä¶) you get to play with lexical variables containing state. These aren‚Äôt easily analyzed, even when the state is ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù (immutability doesn‚Äôt imply discoverability or predictability).</p>
<p>So what is needed, in my view, is better handling of lexical variables (what they contain w.r.t. cybernetic elements of the program) and their evolution through control flow (imperative control flow, but also repeated message receives / function applications). One can imagine that a better understanding of imperative programs might lead to this handling of variables and control flow, since both are present in almost all paradigms in the form they had in imperative languages (an exception I can think of is constraint-solving).</p>

It was rather born out of the limitation of early computer architectures (single ALU, single memory bus, everything has to be synchronized, etc.) When multiple operations are happening in multiple places, imperative programming will no longer be suitable. Another thing to consider is that modern software needs to take care of thousands of different conditions (hardware configurations, user preferences, access controls, GUI events, network inputs and concurrency!). In a purely imperative style, it will blow up if-thens. We somehow needed to "abstract away" those conditionals. Programming styles don't evolve in vacuum. It's constantly reacting to ever changing needs from external forces like these.</p>

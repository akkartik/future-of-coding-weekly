<p>I‚Äôd argue that the most impressive ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù are being made and examined by mathematicians. However, the most useful/advanced ones fail to reach even a moderately sized userbase, since actually using the tools requires a long time of specialized training. An undertaking focused on creating a good ‚Äúuser interface‚Äù to these mathematical tools would be greatly beneficial for the society.</p>
<p>This would have the potential to raise mathematical literacy, which I believe is partly a prerequisite for advancing computing literacy.</p>

After all, contemporary mathematics is just one framework built atop conventional literacy. Of course, that criticism depends on whether or not you think computing can be a truly literate-like medium in the first place.</p>
<p>I stand by the analysis that conventional literacy is the most effective, internalized, and consequential ‚Äútool for thought‚Äù yet devised. It‚Äôs an open question whether computing can fit alongside it</p>

Of course, these are just agreed upon terms, so I'll try to explain just my personal view.</p>
<p>"Literacy" denotes, for me, the ability to use written language (of any kind, even graphical) to store ideas and to aid in communicating them.</p>
<p>"[Adjective] literacy" denotes the ability to appreciate and make use of ideas that make up knowledge generated by the field of [adjective]. It doesn't prescribe any medium through which the ideas should be communicated.</p>
<p>"Tools for thought" I view as any "stuff" that strengthens someone's ability to  <em>think</em> . Thinking is a process, so I don't recognize eg. Obsidian as a tool for thought (it's a knowledge base; it doesn't transform your way of thinking). I'm aware that this is very different from the self-description of the TfT community.</p>
<p>Mathematical objects (some of them) do qualify as tools for thought because they  <em>actively</em>  enable new ways of thinking / they transform your thinking. Mathematics itself is concerned solely with the study of mental objects, mental tools, and mental processes.</p>
<p>I'd say that mathematics and literature (and their corresponding literacies) are complementary, being examples of "thought-toolmaking" and "knowledge-toolmaking", respectively. The latter is concerned with preserving and representing ideas, the former is concerned with manipulating and generating those.</p>
<p>Computing can be used to realize both of these, although it's being used mainly for the latter (proof assistants don't really provide a good math UI, simulations aren't composable). Perhaps this is what I should've said, as it more reflects my view of the real potential of computing.</p>
<p>Please, feel free to challenge these views, descriptions and relations. Also, be aware that the term "tool for thought" / "thought-tool" is overridden here to mean a different thing, the original meaning being replaced by "knowledge-tool". However, the notions of "literacy" and "[adjective] literacy" aren't meant to replace their "actual meaning" - so they in particular should be challenged!</p>

Admins fell free to delete or move]</p>
<p>A language construct terminology question:  <em>What is a good name for the  ‚Äútransposition‚Äù of a Case expression?</em> (see below)</p>
<p> <em>Motivation</em> : The idea is to integrate some more expressive language patterns into e.g. JavaScript using Continuation-Passing Style (CPS), in a friendly way by putting the CPS functionality in predictable places in readable  constructs. The Case expression is similar to Haskell pattern matching in intended usage. The corresponding JavaScript syntax needs a few extra parens and commas.</p>
<p> <em>Clarification</em> : By Case expression I intend:</p>
<pre><code>Case

    &lt;pat p1&gt; &lt;fn succ1&gt;

    &lt;pat p2&gt; &lt;fn succ2&gt;

    ...

    &lt;fn failAll&gt; -- optional</code></pre><p>Success at p#n means choose succ#n.</p>
<p>Failure at p#n means continue with clause n+1.</p>
<p>By ‚Äòtransposition of Case‚Äô I intend:</p>
<pre><code>CaseTransp

    &lt;pat p1&gt; &lt;fn fail1&gt;

    &lt;pat p2&gt; &lt;fn fail2&gt;

    ...

    &lt;fn succAll&gt; -- not optional</code></pre><p>Failure at p#n means choose fail#n.</p>
<p>Success at p#n means continue with p#(n+1).</p>
<p>Note: &lt;pat&gt; are CPS constructs in the form of functions that can succeed or fail. &lt;fail&gt; and &lt;succ&gt; are ordinary functions.</p>

<p>As an aside, there are two things that make CPS worthwhile and fun IMO:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>One can implement any control structure in any language that has first-class functions.</p>

From a mechanical standpoint, those are just human-friendly tags on regular ol' control flow paths. If you strip that away, the only difference I can see is that you've made the default case mandatory. If anything, I feel like you have syntactic sugar for a case expression where all cases but the default get wrapped in some domain-specific failure indicator.</p>

<p>Anyone know of visual programming projects where the user can execute their program, interact to change program state, pause program execution, edit the program to make changes, and then resume execution from that point on with a modified program?</p>
<p>My current thinking is that there's a lot of potential edge cases where the program could break or fail due to undefined semantics, but there could be a sweet-spot for doing minor edits and staying productive due to not having to restart the program from scratch. Hot module replacement has become widely used, but that's limited by having to do traditional text-based coding, and it's only able to replace code at the module level.</p>
<p>I'll illustrate one use case where I think there's a good tradeoff between complexity and reward for the user:</p>
<ul><li>Open a page in the product being coded in a VPL environment</li><li>Open some kind of overlay, e.g. a dialog</li><li>Pause the program</li><li>Tweak the appearance of the dialog while remaining in the context of the current program state</li><li>Add new UI elements to the dialog (non-breaking changes)</li><li>Resume the program</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2022-06-15T15:06:42.563Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Tom Larkworthy</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2022-06-12&amp;toDate=2022-06-18&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2022-06-15T15:06:42.563Z" class="date">2022-06-15 15:06:42</a> <div class="message"><p>yeah I literally just posted a livestream of me doing it.

<p>With Observable the trigger to enter edit mode is focusing the code editor and typing. With a visual canvas, it's a single interaction target, so I don't see how we'd understand whether the user is looking to interact or edit without a toggle button for interact/edit mode. Still, that toggle button is only a single click, same as focusing/clicking in the code editor in Observable, so not a significant friction.</p>

<p>Thanks to hot code reloading, in server programming, we can remember an incoming request in a cell THEN write the implementation AFTER we observe the schema in the external request. We can lazy code against reality, without waiting on fresh requests to arrive</p>

<p><a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> what form of debug output are you thinking of in a Smalltalk program?</p>
<p><a href="https://dekorte.com/">Steve Dekorte</a> it isn't an IDE, but I have this tiny framework for emitting logs with an associated stack depth, along with a tiny tool to zoom in and out of such logs. <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/basic-whitebox-test/tree/main/item/browse_trace/Readme.md">git.sr.ht/~akkartik/basic-whitebox-test/tree/main/item/browse_trace/Readme.md</a> The basic idea is totally language agnostic.

I just set a breakpoint and get the stack trace plus access to an inspector on all the data from the debugger.</p>
<p>If you want to do the traditional style of debug output, Smalltalk systems have the transcript tool for that. In older systems, it captures a character stream. In Pharo + Glamorous Toolkit, I can send arbitrary objects, including stack frames.</p>
<p>There's also the Beacon system (<a href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-beacon">github.com/pharo-project/pharo-beacon</a>), a framework specifically made for logging events, with stack frames if desired. You can even open a debugger from each stored stack frame.</p>
<p>The real message here is that Smalltalk provides (1) an extendable IDE and (2) full introspection on program execution. Capturing a stack frame is a pretty standard operation. The main barrier for newcomers is understanding what a stack frame is, not the technicalities of capturing it.</p>

It's certainly how I work today. My startup configuration file loads all my projects that are not already in the image. Which means that I can start up a fresh image with very little effort. And I end up doing that about once a week. Not necessarily because I messed up my image (though that happens), the main reason is staying up to date with Glamorous Toolkit development.</p>
<p>From that point of view, the image is more like a cache than persistent system state. In line with that view, I don't back up my images, as they are not really valuable. The persistent version of my code resides in Git repositories, just like with code in any other language.</p>

<p>There's no double work really‚Ä¶ You make your changes inside the image. If it's something you want to preserve, you commit it via Iceberg and associated tools, which automatically snapshot the modified modules as text files and commit those to Git. The image startup configuration is a list of module repos and commit IDs, which recreates the image state from the Git committed snapshots.</p>

Another is that you can really leverage packing.  Like, suppose we have a 3D object in front of us.  Just seeing its shape uses up three dimensions, so how do we inspect its attributes?  One way is to pack them next to it.  So when I look at the thing, it receives focus gets a little halo around the outside edge.  Like a shell going around the backside.  Grabbing from the natural angle of my hand to the object, I pick up the object, but if I come in from a weird angle, I grab the shell instead which folds out revealing attribute inspectors.  You can repeat those.  So, I don't know, suppose you have a material sharer with a bunch of color attributes.  You unfold a few. Unfolding a color gives you a color-space cylinder or sphere.  Moving your hand through the space previews changes.  Pulling the trigger selects one.  How to draw a space?  Well, since it's the interior of the volume that's interesting, you certainly don't want to draw it's surface!  One idea is to have a bunch of particles inside wiggling around changing color based on the value of the field in there.  Each particle could have a different way of exploring the space (one favors orbiting around hue, one wiggles back and forth along saturation), so by delegating your selection to one of those, you could sit back and watch the material properties shift in some organized way.</p>

Mutability as a language construct is well trodden ground, but there‚Äôs another kind of mutability that exists at a systems level which isn‚Äôt tied to language design or specific language. Things like filenames would fit in this category. These are often to do with naming but there are many cases where the mutating thing is structural, such as filesystem hierarchies, pointers to digital objects (latest X, agreed-upon version of Y, etc).</p>
<p>This kind of mutability appears more varied and common than the concept in PL, but I don‚Äôt want to refer to it as just ‚Äúmutability‚Äù because this could be misleading. ‚ÄúState‚Äù is not a sufficient notion either, as this is just referring to the value of a thing in relation to time.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm doing some work on ‚ÄúMutability as Governance‚Äù which argues that mutability (at least the kind I refer to here) is best understood as a digital governance problem, as it necessarily involves coordination between multiple systems in ways that mutability within a single language does not. Even pure functional languages interact with a stateful environment and require mutability in this sense (e.g. naming and structuring of source files)</p>
<p>Terms like systemic/emergent mutability, inter-systemic mutability, or multi-party mutability have popped up but I don‚Äôt know if these really do a good job.</p>

<p>My reasons for finding a qualifier are to better communicate the connection between mutability and governance, which I‚Äôve found to be more clear when constraining the examples to ones where coordination among multiple systems/agents/people/programs is clearly necessary, even though ultimately I think my argument holds for all forms of mutation in sometimes less trivial ways. </p>

<p>Although I think authorization is going to be a critical corollary of whatever definition you come up with, if it's not actually part of it. In a single-node/single-actor context, the closest thing to authorization is the type system, so you can get away with ignoring it. It's in the multi-actor context where you start having "governance" problems (if I'm understanding your usage correctly), and it's also right about where authorization starts sneaking (almost subconsciously) into our concept of "changing things"; that is, authorization starts to play a role at just about the same place on the scale axis of mutability as the (beginning of) the interval on that axis that you're trying to name. Again, all assuming that I'm on the same page as you, which I'm still not 100% sure of...</p>

If you merely want to make a distinction between "single agent" mutation and "distributed" mutation, then you might like one of these dichotomies:</p>
<ul><li>[local/solitary] mutation &lt;--&gt; [coordinated/distributed] mutation</li><li>[local/solitary] state transition &lt;--&gt; [coordinated/distributed] state transition</li></ul><p>Or to be even more succinct: the term "coordination" (used standalone <em>)</em>  is essentially a synonym for "distributed state transition". The sole purpose of coordination is to get multiple agents to agree on some kind of "state", at which point they all transition their models of the world to reflect that state. (The term "consensus" is also used for this, but it refers to the outcome moreso than the process.)</p>
<p>If you want to refer to situations where there is a  <em>power imbalance</em> , e.g. the operating system has the privilege to store persistent state, but the user does not, these terms won't cover it. You might want to use terms like "ownership", "privilege", and "permissions". Coordination becomes "requesting".</p>

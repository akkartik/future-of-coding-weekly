L. Parnas</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623">dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623</a></p>
<p>This is one of my favorite papers, and the basic concept that each design decision should be hidden within a module of some sort, where "module" can mean anything from a collection of procedures to a language specific feature, has served me well for many years.</p>
<p>Also, the principle that programs should be broken up by concern and not by the order in which things happen has informed my design decisions for a long time.</p>
<p>Has this paper's approach informed anyone else's design over the years? If so, how?</p>
<p>What principles do the rest of you use to make your programs more resilient against changes in the specifications?</p>

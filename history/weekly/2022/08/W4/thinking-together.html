PoC (Present of Coding) languages, e.g. “static languages” like Haskell, Rust, C++, etc., and, compiler-appeasement dynamic languages like Python, Racket, Scheme, Smalltalk, Common Lisp, etc., are used to optimize and to structure FoC ideas, but, they inhibit out-of-the-box-thinking.  Writing the program twice (or more times) is more efficient than writing the code once only in a PoC language.  What is “efficient”?  At one extreme: all Design and no optimization, at the other extreme: all Production Engineering (optimization) and no Design.</p>

I used to create rube-goldberg type frameworks that would enforce various constraints via metarpogramming, but then I read this article that showed compile type checking could be reduced to runtime checking and we just keep moving the same undecidability problem a level outwards... and it clicked, that all this type stuff was almost pointless, I was trying to do runtime computation at compile time, but with worse debugging tools. It was silly.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<pre><code>I write a bug, I try to compile it, and the computer refuses to, and highlights a line with an error</code></pre><p>vs</p>
<pre><code>I write a bug and I run it, and the computer crashes and highlights the the line with a stack trace</code></pre><p>Anyway, I shifted my focus to visibility at runtime and I think it's a better tradeoff for than types for smaller programs. VERY large software spans the network and database and those are untypes so everything becomes dynamically typed  eventually at the other end of the scale too.</p>

I merely wanted to suggest that speed of execution might be faster if you use the tools you know best. I've found that, while fun to try different languages, there is a knowledge wall which eventually inhibits progress. Sonic Pi comes to mind. I've been a core contributor to that for a while. It is implemented in no less than 4 languages; C++, Elixir, Ruby &amp; Erlang; with significant code in each one.  While a great project, progress is inevitably slow because Sam is really the only one that comes close to understanding how everything works. One thing I've heard Sam say is that ‘Elixir gives me this nice real time scheduling which is great for music’. My personal opinion is that you can achieve that just as easily with most languages. They are all just deep stacks sitting on your CPU.  The down side of the approach is, as I say, speed of implementation. The barrier to entry for Sonic Pi development is huge; it requires technical abilities in many areas to make significant contributions.</p>

<p>Certainly not; just a too-brief reaction to the post!</p>

<p>That is a very fair point; maybe using a C extension 😉 Perhaps 'you can achieve the most in the quickest time using a language you know'.  i.e. I could probably build a scheduler the fastest in C++; and you (speculating) might build one faster in Lisp than Ruby.... etc.</p>

The correctness of distributed databases has improved dramatically in the last 5 years. Multi-language text editing barely existed 20 years ago and is now workable in most UI toolkits. Individual workflows might be more buggy, but overall integrity is a lot better - it's been a long time since I lost data to eg disk corruption.</p>
<p>We also expect a lot more from software than we used to. The entry level nowadays is a web app - an always-on distributed system with cross-platform UI. We haven't really figured out how to make that easy yet. It's not like there is generational knowledge that is failing to be passed on - we've never had a culture that consistently made reliable distributed systems with significant shared state.</p>
<p>A lot of his examples also seem to be from companies that used to be better at software but are now going into some kind of senile decline. But that has been a pattern throughout history.</p>

<p>I think we try too hard to generate software factory workers instead of competent craftsmen. </p>
<p>We create people who can assemble big blocks they don't understand in certain standard ways to solve certain common problems, not people with a deep understanding of their tools and how to solve new problems and create new tools.</p>
<p>This is described well at <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers">wiki.c2.com/?PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a></p>
<p>And the prioritization of sticking to some made-up schedule and shipping "on time" over software quality has created a proliferation of bugs at every level of the stack.</p>
<p>In the days before the internet was widely available, shipping software on physical media, such as a ROM cartridge, floppy disk, or optical disk, automatically created an incentive for the developers to get the software as correct as possible the first time, because distributing updates was slow and unreliable. Bugs were less common than they are today, and they generally had a smaller impact on the user.</p>
<p>The mad rush to ship now and fix later, which comes from the illusion that fixing it later is cheaper because we can just require the user to be connected to the internet and installing updates all the time, leads to code being written more quickly without understanding or planning, and shipped while still error prone and unreliable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as anyone can tell you who has run older operating systems or programs on modern hardware, we have on average gained small amounts of functionality over the years while the software has become drastically slower and buggier.</p>
<p>I suspect that the only way to solve this in the long term is to push for a broad societal migration towards Free Software. Free Software authors seem to take more time getting their code as correct as possible before they make an official release. In fact, it's common for them to spend years getting to their 1.0 release, upon which they stake their reputations. On the other hand, 1.0 releases of proprietary software are sometimes broken to the point of being unusable.</p>
<p>However, using Free Software will not, by itself, solve the problem. It has its own issues with bloat and complexity over time, but Free Software authors seem, on average, to do a better job of taking the time necessary to pay down technical debt and perform necessary refactoring, so for the moment it seems like our best hope.</p>

<p>If we consider only projects that take years to get to their 1.0 release because the authors are refining their craft - then yes, I would expect it to be high quality. But very few open-source projects that I've seen meet that bar.</p>
<p>Most of the repos I come across on Github were started several years ago, worked on for a few months, and then abandoned.</p>
<p>I think whether it's open-source or not, Sturgeon's law applies - "90% of everything is crap."</p>

<p>On the other hand, many Open Source projects are just toys that people choose to share or projects that people choose to develop more openly for pragmatic reasons.</p>
<p>Of course, these are generalizations and there are many exceptions. My comment above remains mostly true if one substitutes something like "quality Open Source" for "Free Software."</p>

<p>Can you elaborate? I'm not sure what you're saying here.</p>

<p>There is almost no market for paid frameworks and programming languages, so market forces don't work to improve the quality of the parts we build on.</p>

<p>I would add that the quest to always be using the new shiny thing combines with this to drive people away from a language or framework once it has finally become mature and stable enough to build reliable software upon.</p>

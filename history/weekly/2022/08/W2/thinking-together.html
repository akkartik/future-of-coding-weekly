You may not like it, but testing these separate is necessary - someone might want to use a different tool for one of those activities, keeping the rest of the toolchain. You might argue that they can just adjust the development environment, but that requires reflection, and still locks you in the environment.</p>

<p>However, maybe we‚Äôre just using different words for the same idea. I can‚Äôt agree with the idea of making editing/compiling/running/testing/debugging a single  <em>thing</em>  (= a single artefact), since that might not suit many people. It also tends to produce a monolith. What one should do is to design a common coherent mediating protocol around edit/compile/run/test/debug, which enables the flow, but which doesn‚Äôt limit the tooling decisions. Maybe this is what you had in mind.</p>
<p>PS: In the monolith approach, if you want to change some tool, you can never do it drop-in style (you always have to integrate it by programming it yourself or by resolving a merge conflict). I don‚Äôt know how the Smalltalk community goes about this issue; if you were dealing with this, tell me your approach.</p>

Jack's point, as I understand it, is that for him the activities "editing/compiling/running/testing/debugging" aren't really different things.  Then Jan's point, as I understand it, is a concern that if all the activities are one activity, then how do you deal with the resulting, single monolithic tool?  A fair question with a potentially interesting answer.  So let me phrase it this way...</p>
<p>Jack, having worked  "this way for decades," where are the natural module lines with what you use?  What can be upgraded independently?  What's pluggable?  For parts of your process are there alternative/multiple tool choices, and do you ever pick both?</p>
<p>An example: for Git, I sometimes use the command line but generally use Sourcetree.  Occasionally unstable, it went very, very wrong yesterday: constant crashing.  So I downloaded and finished with Sublime Merge in the middle of staging changes, with little interruption.  I didn't configure Sublime Merge.  I didn't read any documentation.  I commented to myself "my, my, my, this looks hideous" (read "unfamiliar"), and I was in no mood to learn anything about what might be better/worse/smoother about Sublime Merge.  One tool broke, I picked up another, kept working.</p>

The qualitative difference from a REPL is that you start a query then let it run in the background without caring so much about when or how many results it would produce.  Immediately, you fall into using it for streamed data processing.  Live notebooks become a sort of special case where you just show each expression's most recently enumerated result.   I'm keen to explore the possibilities here more.</p>

Don't know if he's still working on it.  He wouldn't show the tree just answers appearing below the query.  Let me try to conjure an image.  You're at a terminal window.  Run a command.  See a bunch of log nonsense scroll by as it executes.  Hit return.  Now you have a command prompt.  You can run a second command.  The first one is still going, still printing.  It's like you opened opened a second terminal window below the first.  That's what it was like to a first approximation.</p>

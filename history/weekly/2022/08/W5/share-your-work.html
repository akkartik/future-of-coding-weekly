<ul><li>Domain Modeling - A tutorial to learn the skills of analyzing domains and encoding them in software.</li><li>Leverage Machines - A series of compilers for languages that give you high leverage: FORTH, OOP, Lisp, and Logic, each built on the previous one.</li></ul><p>I don't think either will be super popular, but I think you may be interested in them.</p>

<p>Beside your working project, did you pick up any other interesting tid bits youâ€™d take away? New thoughts on how to refine your ideas on the topic, that kinda stuff.</p>

Any time you run such an app you also have all the tools to modify it, right there within the app.</p>
<p>For a while during the week I thought, "this is just a silly experiment, this isn't going to go anywhere because people can't use their own tools." But it might work if it provides a lot of convenience over the status quo.</p>

Itâ€™s exactly what made me enjoy Python and even a bit of Ruby way back when, Iâ€™m that the interpreter let you basically do whatever you want to definitions, functions, what have you. I want that ability in Swift.</p>

Iâ€™d love to apply this technique when developing physics algorithm work (like for network diagrams), especially to watch what happens in the frames before a crash, like in a comic strip. thereâ€™s a VSCode extension that lets you build custom renderers for program state when you drop into the debugger made by Hediet that you may be interested in.</p>

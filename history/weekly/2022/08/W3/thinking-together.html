I don‚Äôt pretend to know which alternatives would be better (and like to think there doesn‚Äôt need to be a single answer) but the explanations for the success of software and the failure of alternatives always seemed pretty underwhelming, often leaning on the fact that software  <em>did succeed</em> as proof of its own <em>.</em> However <em>,</em>  finding an argument to be weak isn‚Äôt really an explanation, even if it suggests the need for one.</p>
<p>Recently I was wondering if there is explanatory power in ‚ÄúConways Law‚Äù if applied to large socio-technical systems. Conway was thinking about the internal structure of software as produced within an organisation in <a href="http://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf">How Committees Invent</a>. The paper has much more nuance, but the adage roughly states: </p>
<blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we apply this line of thinking to computation at large, we might ask questions on the impact of communication mechanisms inherent to capitalism and their structuring effect on the computing landscape. This maps quite well to software, as there is often a correspondence between software production and individual firms. We might imagine a different economy (e.g. some highly federated, anarchist society) and think of what the organisation of computing might look like. This is something I think is interesting to explore on its own, but it lead to a different idea I find quite compelling:</p>
<p>That the success of software is a result of a drive to make computing economically ‚Äúlegible‚Äù to capitalism. </p>
<p>(I‚Äôm appropriating legibility here from James C. Scott‚Äôs <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq3vk">Seeing Like a State</a>)</p>
<p>This makes some sense as an explanation for software, but it might also offer a new explanation for things like app stores among others. </p>
<ul><li>Platforms could be seen as (among other things) exertion of control of legibility, where legibility is much higher for those who control the system (e.g. Amazons view of their own services vs a users view).</li><li>The apparent success of software over alternatives such as open document systems, or composable (non-software) GUI systems, or "computational media" efforts,  <em>might be explained as not a technical or conceptual success, but as providing legibility that alternatives lack.</em></li><li>More interestingly to me, is wether legibility is even something desirable in the first place.</li></ul><p>[This is a slightly rehashed line of thinking I passed around at work that I thought might be interesting to this crowd. This isn‚Äôt thought through, so just read it as casual speculation. But I  <em>do</em> think we need an explanation, if we are ever to move beyond this current way of interacting with digital systems]</p>

<p>However, what I see as the social foundation of the package-based structure of today's computing environments is not capitalism, at least not directly, but the concepts of intellectual property and legal responsibility. A software package is a unit that is owned by someone (person, company, OS community, ...) and may create liabilities for their owner.</p>
<p>For a different architecture, consider (human) language. There are ownable units as well (books, articles,  etc.), but nobody owns English or Chinese. The evolutionary processes are thus very different than for owned units.</p>

<p>I suspect part of the cause is historical, since personal computers couldn't handle more than one focused task at a time for over a decade, which was long enough for a way of thinking to become deeply entrenched.</p>
<p>I also suspect that part of the issue is security. Sandboxing each app by itself, like on iOS or Android, is much easier than allowing untrusted code from multiple sources to all coexist in the same object space, in the Smalltalk or Open doc or NewtonScript sense.</p>
<p>I think we could learn something from multiuser games here, since they've been dealing with the issue of letting untrusted bits of code from multiple sources interact with each other for a long time. Second Life, LambdaMOO, LP Mud, and object capability systems all seem like potential sources of inspiration here.</p>

As for the language example, that‚Äôs actually exactly the counter-example I used at work! I‚Äôll definitely fold ownership or ‚Äúownability‚Äù into future discussions. </p>
<p>The reason I like ‚Äúlegibility‚Äù is because it doesn't point to a specific economic concept like private property, and so might translate more easily to analysis of other economic systems (or variations of our current one). Hence the federated/anarchist example.</p>

End users appreciate legibility, too. It's a lot easier to say/think/believe "I installed Instagram" than "I picked out and copy-pasted/linked to/configured one of several pieces of code, each of which has slightly different interfaces, that lets my computer connect to one of several decentralized image sharing services, each of which have several entry points that might link to different subsets of the network..." </p>
<p>So if you want to get rid of "apps" or whatever big chunk of code/assets you're thinking of, legibility for the end user is something you need to think about. One of the goals I've kept in the back of my mind is for end users to be able to install  <em>and uninstall</em>  something like a layout and attendant keyboard shortcuts, macros, etc for a complex program. I'd like there to be something of a spectrum between that and installing the large program itself. But there needs to be a "thing" there, with a name and a handle to manipulate. Otherwise you start feeling like grime is accumulating in corners and seams of your system that you can't see.</p>
<p>To be fair, even "apps" are an improvement over the unix model of a script that splatters files all over your system.</p>

<p>To understand tech in China, I cannot recommend The Great Firechat enough <a href="https://www.greatfirechat.com/">greatfirechat.com</a>.  It just so happens that Kevin and Adeh started the podcast shortly before the Chinese Communist Party introduced major changes to how it regulates tech.

<p>To sum up the China tech antitrust situation... With consolidation, like one dominant rideshare company (DiDi) and two dominant digital payment systems (Alipay, WeChat Pay) especially with Jack Ma touting how payment data was enabling Ant Financial to outcompete any bank at assessing credit worthiness, the Party felt it was high time to intervene.  No one institution should have too much influence on the Chinese public ‚Äî except the Party itself.  So IPOs have been blocked, Ant Financial was nationalized, apps can no longer collect more data than they need from people.  What else has happened recently?  Online tutoring is no longer a thing.  A huge industry dissolved in about a day.

It is ultimately about different scales of implication/engagement with something.

<p>Human language is defined by locals (speakers) and makes no concessions for outsiders (everyone who doesn't know the language). They have to deal with whatever is there, or use services (translators/interpreters). Legibility is low.</p>
<p>Scientific theories have locals (scientists) and outsiders (everyone else). Like language, they are defined by and for locals. Outsiders have to learn the science, or use services (science journalists, ...). Legibility is low.</p>
<p>In a complex society, there is room and need for both approaches, and probably an intermediate one that remains to be discovered. What I think matters is awareness of the trade-offs, and that's not yet very well developed.</p>
<p>Open Source is a nice illustration. There are OS projects that deliver industrial products just like software vendors do, only with a different commercial model. Firefox is a nice example. Legibility is high, but locals (developers) don't profit from their work other than through income. There are also OS community projects, with communities seeing themselves as working together on a shared asset, i.e. by and for locals. But many of them (the well-known ones: Linux, Python, ...) are much more about a legible product for outsiders, in return for mindshare/idealism/fame/whatever. That doesn't work out well for those locals who believe in the community story, and we get maintainer burnout as a result.</p>

Individuals and communities solving their own problems don't contribute to GDP, so their work doesn't count as valuable. That's clearly a mistake in my opinion. As postmodern thinkers correctly point out, legibility lays the basis for power structures that do a lot of harm (James C Scott's book "Seeing like a state" is the classic on this topic). On the other hand, anonymous exchange does produce a real contribution to well-being. It just shouldn't have a monopoly.</p>

It really seems so darn trivial, but I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt get it! Let me type it out, and if it‚Äôs helpful, I can upload some of the sketches I have trying to break it down. So, here‚Äôs the gist:</p>
<p> <code>Keywords: Texture / glyph atlas, macOS, Swift, Metal, iOS, vector space transforms</code> </p>
<p>Given: I‚Äôve got a set of ‚Äúvertices‚Äù (x, y) in normalized space, from (-1, 1) on the domain and range. Just a simple cartesian space. I‚Äôve also got a set of ‚Äútexture coordinates‚Äù (u, v), which instead map to (0, 1) on the domain and range, with (0, 1) on the range an x-axis flip. This is apparently really common, and it‚Äôs the way the Metal shading language defines its coordinate spaces.</p>
<p>I also know how to convert from vertex-space to uv-space:</p>
<pre><code>u = (x + 1) / 2

v = -(y - 1) / 2</code></pre><p>Also given: I have a texture in UV space where I want to define arbitrary rectangles. These rectangles are glyph-stamps in the [(0,1), (0,1)] bounding box range. These are easily computed given the full size of the texture I am creating rectangles from.</p>
<p>The problem: I have a single set of vertices that define a quad. Top left / right, bottom left / right. These are always centered around the origin. Meaning, I can have a square that fills the vector space with these coordinates:</p>
<pre><code>(-1,  1)

(-1, -1)

( 1,  1)

( 1, -1)</code></pre><p>Assume we will ‚Äúresize‚Äù those in some way by symmetrically bringing in the sides as needed - again, all around the origin.</p>
<p>Given that I have those precomputed coordinates above which map to UV space, how do I take those arbitrary vertices in vertex space and map them to the ‚Äòrectangular sections‚Äô of uv-space?</p>

<p>Is the question how to define a transformation that sends four coordinates v1,v2,v3,v4 to the four coordinates (0.25,0.25), (0.25, 0.75), (0.75, 0.25), (0.75, 0.75)?</p>

<p>I think that‚Äôs my question, yeah‚Ä¶ The target coordinates will vary, but that‚Äôs the idea. And the reason being that the same vertices (v1-4) will always pipe through the graphics pipeline, but the vertices for each constant that defines the instance being drawn will be unique. I want to take an input vertex which is at one of those coordinates, and say, ‚ÄúThis coordinate is at ___ u,v position within the bounds given by the constants that define this instance)‚Äú.</p>
<p>I think I haven‚Äôt define the problem correctly, because the more I write it out, the more I think something is missing.. I‚Äôm just not sure.</p>

The mapping can be expressed as the composite of three simpler maps:</p>
<p>(1) Translate the original rectangle to the origin. This is achieved by the mapping sending an arbitrary vector x to x-v1.</p>
<p>(2) Scale the resulting rectangle so it is the same size as the rectangle w1...w4. In the horizontal direction you have to scale by |w3-w1|/|v3-v1|. In the vertical direction it is |w2-w1|/|v2-v1|.</p>
<p>(3) Translate the resulting rectangle from the origin to w1. This is the mapping sending an arbitrary vector x to x+w1. Composing these three maps will map  v1...v4 to w1...w4.</p>

OCaml's  <code>utop</code>  is better, and the implementors have recently suggested that the current state of the compiler admits further improvements to its interactivity. The team working on Hazel have told me that they'll be exploring live coding in an environment with typed holes in the near future. There are also Lisp dialects ‚Äî most notably Shen ‚Äî  that support an interesting hybrid way of working; definitely worth checking it out.</p>

<p>With modern logging frameworks it's non-trivial to determine if a debug print is working like it should. You don't see a test print, do you have the right logging level, is it logging to the right sink, are the logs from the container making it out of the container, etc., etc. So  <em>not only</em>  are we still living in the mainframe+teletype era, we're actively moving in the  <em>wrong</em>  direction. At least when we programmed with teletypes on mainframes we didn't have to worry if a print was getting intercepted before it got on paper.</p>

<p>&amp;gt; In this paper, we describe how creators of systems that support intellectual work like design, writing, or organizing and interpreting information are particularly at risk of expecting too great a level of formality from their users. To understand the effects of imposing or requiring formality, we draw on our own experiences designing and using such systems.

<p>We don't know how to keep working things working over time, how to keep things from sucking with scale (more users, more use cases). Without that technology --  <em>for the sorts of large applications one typically deals with in commercial settings</em>  -- it still seems worth being minimalist with the stack one depends on, that one's application sits on top of.</p>
<p>Like, I'm not sure it's even realistic to expect progress in software tools. Moloch evolves, but in ways that are inscrutable to human values.</p>
<p>(I'll still work on these ideas on the side. But only because I can control application size when I'm working by myself. Moloch ignores me cowering behind my tree stump.)</p>

<p>We have been building more and more complex software over the decades by piling up layer after layer. That makes the lower layers a kind of basic infrastructure that becomes impossible to evolve, because lots of people's uncoordinated decisions depend on it.</p>
<p>Put differently: we still use terminals emulating punched cards for the same reasons that constrain cars to the width of a horse carriage (which is what defined the width of roads).</p>
<p>You can avoid the inertia of the past in a small controlled environment (just you, or a small team). But evolving the mainstream to better infrastructure is a collective action problem - and those are well known to be hard.</p>

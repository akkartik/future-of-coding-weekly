<p>But I haven't used Fossil for code so far. The main reason is that it doesn't have decent Emacs integration. Git has Magit, which is the best UI I have ever seen for a VCS. I'd rather fight git now and then than give up Magit.</p>

No matter how useful the warning is, how insidious the situation it protects you against.</p>
<p>The reason for this seems to be that not everyone who sees a warning is empowered to fix the underlying cause. You might use a library that does something warning-worthy. You can't change the library yourself to fix the warning.</p>
<p>Question for live-program enthusiasts like <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a>[1][2]: I wonder how much this problem is caused by overusing batch-programming and an insufficiently expressive communication channel for warnings.

It's more an issue of dependency handling in the Open Source world. In the world of artisanal and industrial products, clients deal with a single supplier, who is responsible for the product sold, including all its components from the supply chain. Commercial software works much like that as well. In Open Source, everybody is responsible for their piece of code but not for its dependencies. In theory, it's the end user who installs everything who is responsible for the correct working of the assembly, but the typical end user can't really do much about technical problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's the ambiguous self-image that Open Source developers (both individuals and communities) have. They want to be part of a network of like-minded developers who share code, but they also want large-scale adoption by end users. They end up advertising their products to end users while at the same time proclaiming in the small print not to be responsible for any problems. That's a mismatch between advertising and hard promises that's not so different from commercial vendors.</p>

So it's the user who is the manager of the top-level software assembly. BTW, the idea of free software (Stallman's famount printer driver story) goes back to the same context. Neither free software nor live environments have been adapted to today's context of software as an industrial product for non-expert users.</p>

In fact, there is little difference between the two other than the interface technology (linking vs. process calls). In both cases, the issue is not bad will nor incompetence, but insufficiencies in both the social structures and the technical infrastructure for software development. The only way an OSS developer can take full responsibility for dependencies is by maintaining forks of everything, and that's beyond most developers' means (but I suspect that this is what Microsoft etc. do).</p>

Now, assuming that such a dependency is used only by that one program (it's properly isolated, not being a shared library), then any defect should only come from the dependency itself or from the interaction between the dependency and the program. In the former case, the programmer should have chosen something that works; in the latter, it's probably his fault it doesn't work (unless it's a bug, in which case he unfortunately has to work around it). Yes, I know that in some environments, even isolated dependencies might clash (I've seen this happen with npm packages), but then, why bother using such environments?</p>

<p>An example from my own past: in the 1990s, I was part of the team that launched the Scientific Python ecosystem. Our main sustainability worry was "what if Guido is hit by a bus?" We had doubts about Python's survival chance for lack of community support. That turned out to be no issue: Python became immensely popular in the 2000s and developed a large developer community.</p>
<p>But then... Python 3 came along, and the Python developer community ended up actively killing Python 2. Lots of domain-specific scientific libraries (including one of my own: <a href="https://github.com/khinsen/MMTK/">github.com/khinsen/MMTK</a>) have become very hard to use because of everyone dropping support for Python 2. And we typically don't have the means for a porting effort to Python 3. So were we negligent in the 1990s for adopting Python 2 as a dependency?</p>

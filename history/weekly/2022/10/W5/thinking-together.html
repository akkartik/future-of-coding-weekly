Didn't get to the part of how that'd actually work given the messy nature of people, but sure would be an interesting situation 😄</p>
<p>Where's all the ambition, the sense of adventure, that drove funding in the 60s? A time where the mother of all demos was possible to achieve with a small team that thought outside the box. Have VCs, researchers and funders become disillusioned. Have marketing teams cried wolf too many times. Have people given up on solving the really hard problems at the core of code. Who's picking up the mantle from the Engelbarts and Victors? Who's willing to fund their work and have it become products that changes people's lives.</p>

Unfortunately, it's going to be difficult to get them to diverge from that, unless there's a hype craze like the recent crypto/web3 one. The closest success right now to the ideas here is probably Replit - though it isn't yet huge, it clearly has a strong product velocity and is something of a darling (and the sponsor of this podcast). Even new languages like Unison and Dark have been funded, but they both still look fairly similar to those in use now, and don't address end-user applications. Now, the narrative has shifted to AI, and I think any project here seeking funding will have to answer to that as well. VCs at least know that "worse is better" and successful innovation requires compromise - all else is storytelling.</p>

To <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a>’s point, ARPA funding dried up in the 70s and completely closed off in the 80s, pushing the responsibility for development to industry, academia, and hobbyists, none of which could deliver on a cohesive vision of a programming environment like PARC managed to.</p>

It's like the 60s and 70s thought of code and coding tools as critical infrastructure that everyone needs access to. I guess the problem is that takes it into political territory, and then it becomes a discussion around the degree to which it needs to be privatized. Everyone agrees (mostly) that roads, police, fire dept. etc. is paid for and used by everyone. Beyond that it's a divisive mess.</p>

I don't think the medium is the problem. I think it's the way we've been asking end-users to interact with it:</p>
<p>So far, 99% of human-to-code interactions have been code-as-text, an interaction paradigm with unforgiving syntax and symbolic mental models.</p>
<p>Investments in interaction paradigms for code have almost exclusively focused on code-as-text and code-as-export, but there are other more end-user friendly ways of interacting with code that we can explore.</p>
<p>Let's break down the interaction paradigms for code (tell me if I missed any!):</p>
<ul><li><em>Code-as-text</em>  (massively explored): You type, the code editor helps you type. Examples: IDEs, Low-Code</li><li><em>Code-as-export</em>  (mostly explored): Code is treated as a secondary source of truth via one-way export flows from some vendor-specific data you're editing. The tool cannot manipulate or understand the code it just exported, and the interaction ends here. Examples: Vector-based UX design tools, No-Code</li><li><em>Code-as-programming-portals</em>  (moderately explored): <strong>@Maggie Appleton</strong> wrote a great breakdown of this at <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/programming-portals">maggieappleton.com/programming-portals</a></li><li><em>Code-as-data</em>  (largely unexplored): Direct manipulation of code ASTs/code visualizations/code output. The tool responds to non-textual interaction from the user and reconciles their intent with a corresponding change in the underlying code-as-text storage.</li><li><em>Code-as-executable</em>  (largely unexplored): A code engine/runtime executes code-as-data changes that result from user interactions to give the user instant feedback, closing the feedback loop of the interaction. Related to live-coding, but where live-coding is tied to code-as-text, code-as-executable can respond to changes from code-as-text as well as code-as data.</li><li><em>Code-as-source-of-truth</em>  (massively explored): IDEs, version control systems. The primary interaction consists of reconciling your code interactions with those performed by others, e.g. through merging, pushes, conflict resolution.</li></ul><p>There's so much unexplored territory outside the traditional code-as-text and code-as-export interaction paradigms! Would love to know what you think and whether I've missed any 😄</p>

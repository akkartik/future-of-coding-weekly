Of all of the node-based tools i’ve seen, imo it has done the best job at bridging the gap between text based and node based programming, while also (most impressively) embedding a fairly rigorous notion of time into the whole environment</p>

<ul><li>the data-flow paradigm forces me to to think in terms of inputs/outputs/interfaces up front (but lots of little UI quality of life things make doing this VERY fast)</li><li>the visual-scripting, 2D paradigm makes it easy to have a “continuum” of modularization - i can stick a bunch of nodes in their own region as a “section”, and treat them loosely as a module, but still leave them open for fast hacking. This, combined with the first point, still leaves things pretty organized and makes “on the fly” component creation very organic</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div></div></div>

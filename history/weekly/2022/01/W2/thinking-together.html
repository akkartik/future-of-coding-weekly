<ul><li>Ad hoc event handling and state management</li><li>An exercise left to the user</li><li>‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry dave, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt do that‚Äô</li></ul><p>I think we tend this way because the underlying substrates (CPUs, peripherals, ISAs, PL grammars) are so well characterized as to allow formerly unthinkable consistency with open-loop methods.</p>
<p>It seems like there‚Äôs a lot of low hanging fruit here, and it gets at the heart of what ‚Äòliveness‚Äô is about. I‚Äôm curious if anyone here has experience working with controls/dynamical systems, or pointers to FoC type projects being approached in this way.</p>
<p>PS if you‚Äôre not familiar with controls, a wikipedia trip makes it seem like a lot of daunting math, but the basics are actually pretty simple. Basically you‚Äôve got your current system state, a function to compute the next state, and then whatever parameters you can actual directly control (‚Äúdirect manipulation‚Äù). If you‚Äôve ever used React or FRP, they get halfway there, then overcomplicate and oversimplify it at the same time. Here‚Äôs a friendly intro if you‚Äôre curious: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-OqgFE9SD4"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-OqgFE9SD4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-OqgFE9SD4</a>.</p>

<p>You may be interested in my project, the Mech programming language, which is designed specifically for these kinds of systems. I actually posted an update about it here just yesterday! <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1641347451138200"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1641347451138200">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CCL5VVBAN/p1641347451138200</a></p>
<p>My background is in robotics, so I am designing Mech to be the ideal language to use on robotic systems, which of course make heavy use of control! You are right, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit here:</p>
<ul><li>Units are a big one. Control systems operate in the real world, which has all kinds of dimensions. Adding units to type systems can be a big win, allowing you to verify correctness and improve reliability (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">this</a> should never happen again).</li><li>Handling time explicitly is important for control systems. Having temporal operators (whenever, until, before, followed by, as soon as) can help programmers reason about control systems.</li><li>Asynchrony be default. The real world is asynchronous, so control systems must be as well. There's no blocking when it comes to reality.</li><li>Parallelism by default. A lot of algorithms for control systems are highly parallelizable.</li><li>Distributed programming by default. Control systems are all about coordinating disparate physical machinery to achieve a desired outcome. It's often the case that this system is composed of upwards of dozens of processing units. Think of all the computers that are in your car. A robot might have a dedicated computer per limb, networked with a CANN bus or ethernet. IOT control systems might have sensors that span a building or an entire town.</li><li>The same kind of math that GPUs do on games is done for control systems, so native GPGPU support is critical.</li><li>The real world is continuous but computerized control systems are discrete. It's important to take this into account as well. Consider a real-world control system that handles money. You don't want to use IEEE floating point for that.</li><li>Data is everything, so logging, searching, slicing, and visualizing data need to be first-class. Visualization is one of the most important debugging techniques for these kinds of systems. Logging must also be built-in and robust to failures. Typically the development cycle for a robot goes like this: 1. write some code 2. run the robot 3. watch the robot crash 4. look at the logs and figure out why the robot crashed 5. goto 1. So automatic logging and replay-ability of logs is also crucial. Once upon a time when I was in gradschool, I heard a tale from before my time of woe due to forgetting to set the logging flag to on. The goal was to make scans like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8YKShFlKvY">these</a> of the town using the remains of <a href="https://vimeo.com/373043">Little Ben</a>, but parked cars obstructed the sidewalk view from the road. The solution then was to go out at 3 in the morning when all the cars were gone to take these scans. But one tired grad student forgot to set the logging flag to true, so they drove around all night collecting data, but it was all immediately lost. People were not happy with him.</li></ul><p>Current approaches rely on middleware to enable some of the above features. <a href="https://ros.org">ROS</a> is one such middleware for robots. It's called an operating system but it runs on top of Linux. It provides a networking api to publish and subscribe to messages produced by control nodes. But the problem, aside from the fact that ROS is nigh unusable even for experts, is that the actual programming is still done in C++ or Python. I don't think I have to explain to this crowd how much of a letdown that is. C++ and Python and any other imperative language is the exact wrong kind of tool to use in this scenario.</p>
<p>Parallel, async, distributed code is way easier to write if the whole system is designed for it. Parallel/async code got a reputation for being a nightmare to write because it's a nightmare to write in C++. But that doesn't preclude other systems being better! I think you see a general recognition in the industry that things are going this way. But I don't think they have realized yet that it's better to use a system designed from first principles to support these features than to bolt them on to C++ or Python or Javascript.</p>
<p>Mech is still really early, so even it doesn't support all the features I laid out above. But that's one of the goals for the project: to be a better language for robot systems.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm happy you brought this topic up, because I love talking about it!</p>

Thanks for sharing, you‚Äôre in my neck of the woods too (Philly). Everything you laid out here is great. What I‚Äôm most interested in is a layer down I think: reifying the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FvrON0OmYc">dynamics</a> of the systems being programmed (which FRP is silent on). A corollary to this is being able to work easily with data-driven models, which is necessary when practically designing this systems but can also be easier than closed-form equations for beginners. Is this something you‚Äôve thought about incorporating into Mech?</p>
<p>I have a hunch this approach could scale nicely from beginner games, robots, and websites all the way to some very cutting edge stuff based on <a href="https://diffprogramming.mit.edu/">differentiable programming</a>.</p>

<p>I think control theory is very applicable to distributed system because failures have to be considered, and not in PL research because a single computer is considered error free (or unrecoverable at least).</p>

<p>There's just such a big chasm between the voices in the space that get millions-billions in VC funding vs the really interesting work going on a bit under the surface.</p>
<p>E.g. Ceptr, Holochain, Protocol Labs/IPFS/IPLD, Commons Stack (as one of many groups oriented around commons and public goods), etc.</p>
<p>So many really great researchers and research communities that have a lot to offer our community here. And vice versa.</p>
<p>It's about a lot more than decentralisation or currency and <code>Web3 != crypto</code>. it's sad to see so much public attention around the least interesting parts of the space like bitcoin or etherium or the many predatory businesses that have emerged.</p>

And honestly I think/hope we‚Äôll discover that many in these two worlds are trying to push in very related and complementary directions.</p>

As people in the FoC world I think many of us can empathise there.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to try and build bridges between our community and related research communities in the Web3 space let me know, always up for a chat!</p>

But some of them seem to be clearly riding on the "web3" wave, perhaps because of the visibility this gives. IPFS, for example, is a project I have been following for years with much interest (and I am even using it a bit), but I am not so happy about their communication which is very much "IPFS is a complement to blockchains".</p>

Can't see it happening though, it's similar to some in this community preferring the term ‚Äúmedium of thought‚Äù or something other that ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù, it's just got so much momentum it's hard to see it changing.</p>

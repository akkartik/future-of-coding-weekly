<p>A thing that surprises me slightly seeing some knowledge workers who try Matlab or Mathematica is that they sit down and just think that they should be able to use the thing.  (On this front, Wolfram|Alpha input is the one thing that comes close.  You type in a simplified version of what you want to ask to lookup the obscure syntax for doing that sort of calculation.)</p>

Partly it was, because some things were misaligned, the problem in the first place, but properly aligned it didn't look much different to the untrained.</p>

<p>I was initially motivated by the vague feeling that something about software development today is wrong and that there has to be a better way. My working hypothesis was that programming is too complicated. If we made it more accessible, everyone could create precisely the tools they need to solve their problems.</p>
<p>Is this true? If we gave everyone the ability to program overnight, very little would change. People still couldn’t quickly build tools to solve problems. I know this because I currently don’t use any tool I’ve created for myself. Most of the time, it’s just not worth it to build a tool for myself. Making programming easier isn’t sufficient to create an ecosystem of DIY tools. The shape of the artifact that we produce when we program has to change as well.</p>
<p>The next question is: Do people even want to create their own tools? The answer is most people probably don’t. B Nardi [1] surveyed how people use applications that support end-user programming like spreadsheets or CAD software. What she discovered is that most people only used basic features. If they wanted to do something more advanced, they relied on the few people on their team (10 - 20%) that had an intrinsic interest to tinker with computers and read manuals. She called these expert users local developers because they helped raise the technical sophistication of everyone by supporting their colleagues with questions and by sharing macros or formulas that they’ve created. We can see the emergence of local developers also in the no-code movement. There are now dedicated agencies that focus purely on creating no-code applications [2].</p>
<p>My initial hypothesis that we have to make programming easier was naive and too focused on the creation process. In the future, I want to focus more on the shape that applications should have once they are built. So, for example, I’m less interested in finding more user-friendly abstractions than the EXCEL formula language. Instead, I want applications that you can take apart into recombinable parts.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A reason that the people who can program often don't feel the need to program is that many of their software needs have already been met by the mountain of past work from people similar to them — programmers. But people who can't currently program will have needs they face in their work that are less likely to have been met by software, because "people similar to them" are also presumably not able to program.</p>
<p>But that's just a quibble with this one supporting argument. I still agree with the conclusions you draw.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with this assertion, assuming I'm interpreting it correctly. I think we can make it practical for end users with technical aptitude to make apps.</p>
<blockquote><p>My working hypothesis was that programming is too complicated. If we made it more accessible, everyone could create precisely the tools they need to solve their problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by "make it more accessible"? There are many ways you could interpret that goal. Oftentimes when people say this, they mean making programming easier to learn. Other times, they mean making the programming community more friendly and diverse. Personally, I'm focused on re-inventing the very foundations of programming to make it simpler.</p>

Many companies are already doing this with their "no code" and "low code" apps, but of course these are closed ecosystems. If you want an open, universal ecosystem of combinable code snippets, I would call that a (distributed) programming environment.</p>

<p>Needless to say, both <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a>'s history browser and mine are examples of programs we've written for ourselves. They're kinda idiosyncratic, and we often work around their limitations rather than fix them. But they've both allowed us to treat this group's history as part of our exo-brain. I consider them great examples of the sorts of programs people would benefit from (without learning machine code) if they learned programming.</p>

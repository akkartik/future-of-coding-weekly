There‚Äôs a parallel with the popular ‚ÄúType I/Type II‚Äù thinking analogy: deep learning is great for Type I thinking (pattern matching, interpolation, ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù), while there hasn‚Äôt been much progress yet with Type II thinking (generalization, planning, ‚Äútopology‚Äù). The idea is that you need both: a perception layer that goes from continuous to discrete, and a ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù layer to work with the results. A recent example of program synthesis is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381">DreamCoder</a>.</li><li>IMO we‚Äôre about to see all the wrong assumptions that are encoded in current software systems recapitulated in this new trend in AI research, since these efforts will use existing programming languages for the program synthesis component (DreamCoder uses a lisp).

<p>Ha - I certainly am more averse to AI, specifically the trend of slapping ML on anything and everything. Consider copilot, which autocompletes textual code, without modeling any semantics. It kinda seems backwards.. first we make something hard to do, then try to work around it by heavy ML / statistical models. No wonder when its wrong it is totally wrong: secret keys, joke code etc.</p>
<p>Having said that, I got a few very good responses to a tweet once <a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1312073013194493952"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1312073013194493952">https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1312073013194493952</a></p>
<p>I'll summarize:</p>
<ul><li>instead of putting ML into production directly, use it to find a function that does what you want, then render it out as human-readable code for deployment</li><li>exploratory programs - write a program to generate some shapes, then use a DNN to generate shapes you did not think of</li><li>given some requirements in a constraints language, do a ML driven search in a very broad solution space</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments">
<blockquote><p>üê¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/@chatur_shalabh">Shalabh</a>: Using ML to read, generate or otherwise manipulate code has always seemed absurd <em>to me</em>.</p>
<p>We don't teach the machine to compute mean() or sin() using ML. We just 'implement the algorithm'. Ok, these algos are easy but we also implement more complicated logic.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

To me the responses you got are nice but just scratch the surface. For instance, <a href="https://fluxml.ai/blog/2019/03/05/dp-vs-rl.html">differentiable programming</a> is a very rich area to explore, even without introducing ‚Äúheavy ML‚Äù, and can mesh very well with existing domain knowledge.

<ul><li>AI community is SOTA oriented, if a method leads to good metrics, it will be adopted despite we do not know how it is working. Program synthesis generated human readable program can not outperform unreadable blackbox neural networks, so the interest of it will be limited. It might be useful to distill pattern to detect anomaly, such as seasoning effect of time series. Still, do not know if any program sythesis approach can achive SOTA in anomaly detection tasks.</li><li>Program synthesis might be viewed as a form of unsupervised learning. It can help human to interpret the data, finding deep statistics about the pattern. But synthesis program might not be a good representation of knowledge learned from vast amount of data.</li><li>‚Äúprogrammer/end user‚Äù dichotomy to me is about the producer of big language model (such as GPT-3) and users fine-tune them for downstream tasks. Most "end user" will not have access to the software/hardware to produce another GPT-3, they will be forced to reuse whatever was given due to cost. Just like we reuse excel for everything.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2022-01-19T13:58:29.095Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Dalton Banks</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2022-01-16&amp;toDate=2022-01-22&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2022-01-19T13:58:29.095Z" class="date">2022-01-19 13:58:29</a> <div class="message"><p>Hi <a href="https://github.com/taowen">taowen</a>, have you looked at the ARC Challenge paper above? So far, program synthesis is the only competitive approach for that benchmark, which is part of the charm of how it was constructed. To me it‚Äôs a good illustration of the limits of today‚Äôs SOTA methods.</p>
<p>The way I see it informally, whether you use program synthesis, NNs, or any other approach in designing your system, it needs both ‚Äúlookup table‚Äù and ‚Äúinductive reasoning‚Äù modes for robust real-world operation. Type I vs Type II thinking, if you will. Lookup tables are what you get from (nonrecurrent) NNs, and they beat inductive reasoning for performance (and usually accuracy) if things never change and you have enough data to train with. However, results from chaos theory show that lookup tables can‚Äôt be a universal approach when navigating real-world dynamical systems. On the other hand, causal chains are very effective tools for generalization under novel (sparsely sampled) conditions. So inductive reasoning beats lookup tables in new or changing environments, but in most current systems this is left to the engineers designing the system or offloaded to end users.</p>
<p>As a brief counterexample, classical mechanics is a program synthesis approach (as nicely illustrated in <a>Structure and Interpretation of </a><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/sicm-html/book-Z-H-4.html">Mechanics</a>), and is a preemiment example of knowledge representation learned from vast amount of data.</p>

It's the same issue we have with Bayesian modelling and many other data-heavy methods: there is some basic layer of assumptions baked into the system before any data flows in, and those assumptions cannot be tested, no matter how much data is available. I suspect it's the same with human learning, but our basic assumptions about the world have been shaped by evolution to be reasonable (perhaps I am overly optimistic here!).</p>

Anyone built any apps designed to be exclusively self-hosted? What could that mean for the future of SaaS?</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2022-01-19T21:49:12.099Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Andrew F</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2022-01-16&amp;toDate=2022-01-22&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2022-01-19T21:49:12.099Z" class="date">2022-01-19 21:49:12</a> <div class="message"><p>I think it's more important that it be easy for "everyone" i.e. non technical users to transfer their data and apps from one host to another. I predict that literally running your own server will be a minority activity forever. But if the app hosting is properly commoditized, then the bulk of users retain similar levels of control over their digital lives as they would if they were fully self hosting, and can switch back and forth as desired.</p>
<p>That implies data portability first and foremost. Anyone should be able to sync their app state to a plain hard drive, and upload it to a different provider on a moment's notice. This further implies a certain independence from IP addresses. I'd like to see apps identified by the public keys of their owners rather than a thin veil over an IP address (yes, this means someone needs to solve asymmetric crypto usability).</p>
<p>But if all that works, putting up an app could be as simple as editing some of "your files/data", in a designated directory or whatever, and a general-purpose sync/backup algorithm deploys them, the same one that syncs files between your phone and laptop (data portability strikes again). Further deployment sophistication can be added later.</p>
<p>There are also security concerns if the software has state; some kind of sandbox abstraction will mostly do it while being user-friendly. I do expect that to be the fundamentally tricky part, though.</p>

And then made it very OS friendly (so far on iOS, and soon on Android). Which means strong integration with Siri, shortcuts, and widgets. Along with the ability to  rapidly build mini apps and share them. The platform can also respond to silent push notifications which in essence gives us server like capabilities.</p>

"Hosting and publishing your own content" should be as simple as running up Minecraft on your phone and opening it up to the LAN for other players to join.</p>

<p>Programming languages assume all code they run is trustworthy. Browsers assume all connections they make over a network are trustworthy. I'm starting to experiment with alternatives to these approaches. Here's one early, extremely caricatured sandboxing model that's already more flexible than both conventional languages and browsers.</p>

I am not sure if this is the case here.</p>
<p>I think the right model is decoupling file selection (done by a trusted computing component, from set of files) and file access - authority is granted by the actual transmission of the selected file to the app (as a capability).</p>
<p>i.e: Instead of passing a file string/id into a global namespace, and separately giving permissions into that namespace - there is no globally accessible namespace of files, and you give the open file itself to the app.</p>

Yet üôÇ</p>
<p>Like I said, I'm not an expert and would appreciate someone going over what I come up with. What I had in <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu"></a><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a> (really <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu1"></a><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu1">https://github.com/akkartik/mu1</a>) was quite hokey.</p>
<p>I believe trusted components basically work by preventing automation and hindering discoverability. Is that accurate?</p>
<p>One thing I care about is being able to continue using an app without granting all requested privileges. For example, easily creating a fake file system with honeypot data. That feels orthogonal to capabilities. They don't preclude it, but they also don't make it easy by themselves.</p>
<p>So I feel like there are some trade-offs to weigh here. But maybe I'm wrong and it's all a solved problem. Pointers most appreciated.</p>

Anyway, I don't think it's a solved problem at all.  Object capabilities have never  made it, at least to the mainstream, as far as I'm aware. But I'm a big fan of the idea.</p>

<p>I think we can probably be finer-grained than a giant "Network" capability, too.</p>
<p>Probably a capability to connect to specific domains, or maybe all domains but only in specific protocols or only in limited ways.</p>

<p>One challenge with networking is that reads and writes become less obvious. Parsing packets may not be sustainable. But we can certainly track what host we're connecting to.</p>

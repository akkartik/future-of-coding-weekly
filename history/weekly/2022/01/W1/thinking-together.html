<blockquote><p> Linear optimization is a powerful modeling method for discovering the best solution to a problem among a set of available alternatives. It is one of todayâ€™s most important branches of mathematics and computer scienceâ€”and also a surprisingly rich medium for creating breathtaking works of art.&nbsp;&gt; Opt Art&gt; &nbsp;takes readers on an entertaining tour of linear optimization and its applications, showing along the way how it can be used to design visual art.</p>

Just one. Even 3/4 of one would be an improvement. Gah.</p>

Same thing we do every year Pinky.  ðŸ¤£  At the moment...</p>
<p>(1) I have a cute idea for a logic language somewhere between Prolog and Ohm.</p>
<p>(2) I would like to add a less definite, more probabilistic aspect to it.</p>
<p>(3) I want to continue exploring a notion of kinetic, non-symbolic, embodied programming where motions are used to define transformations of whole spaces rather than acting on discrete points.</p>
<p>Perhaps an even better question is what would success look like for each project:</p>
<p>(1) Allow for the definition of a game like rummy in about a page of code.  Likewise, for a serviceable AI player.</p>
<p>(2) It should be easy to turn a parser for a language like JSON into an error correcting parser, "You're probably missing a double quote here 'cus otherwise the rest of this doesn't make sense."</p>
<p>(3) Defining the gamma function should feel as natural in its own way as defining factorial in a functional programming language.  (See <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html">The Evolution of a&nbsp;Haskell&nbsp;Programmer</a>.)</p>

Framing its goal in FoC terms, it's a computational medium for a very specific audience, computational scientists.</p>
<p>(B) I'd not only work on Leibniz itself, but also implement a collection of computational tools (and/or interfaces to existing tools) on top of it, to demonstrate its utility.</p>

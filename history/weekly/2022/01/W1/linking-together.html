<blockquote><p>üê¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/@danluu">Dan Luu</a>: In general, I don't think it's very interesting when someone spends a lot of time talking about how much better the world would be if we all listened to them when they don't discuss specific details about what mechanisms would make things better and why. <a href="https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1474111409365655559">https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1474111409365655559</a></p>
<p>üê¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/@hillelogram">Hillel</a>: Vision and speculation are great, but Kay often criticizes modern computing for not matching his vision. But maybe it's his vision that was off? Maybe kids would never have used a Dynabook the way he imagined they'd use it</p>

But I could never find the source for it. That claim does seem plausible to me; my laptop (seems to) take as long to boot now as my desktop did 20 years ago. Maybe I'll buy Dan's patreon to get the details.</p>

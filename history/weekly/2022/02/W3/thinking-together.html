<p>I believe it was Jean Piaget who introduced ‚Äòschema‚Äô to psychology in the 1920s-1930s. </p>
<p>But schema had already been developed in philosophy (such as Kant in Critique of Pure Reason). Also developed in logic to specify rules of inference, mathematics to describe theories with infinite axioms, and adequacy conditions in semantics.</p>
<p>Point being that psychology was itself appropriating a prior term. So pinning down when this happened for computing is really hard. Many early computer scientists were influenced by the prominent theories of mind when thinking about the nature of information, knowledge, reasoning, etc.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd have to dig harder but my suspicion is that there'll be written accounts of ‚Äòschemas‚Äô in computing going back into the 50s, because the prominence of things like constructivism, first-order logic, and the theories of mind/knowledge/reasoning that used that term became prominent in the 30s, right as many of those people were in school/university.</p>

<p>The last link there is an interesting example, because even though the term ‚Äúschema‚Äù doesn‚Äôt appear it is exactly what is being described and developed. So perhaps the term was used post-hoc to put all the related ideas under a single term.</p>

<p>The term "program schema" was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/321203.321204">seemingly coined in 1958</a>. It means something similar to "pseudo-code" or perhaps an AST.

Provenance documents the inputs, entities, systems, and processes that influence data of interest, in effect providing a historical record of the data and its origins.

<p>Where provenance charts the history/past of data, is there a term that refers to its future, such as possible transformations, movement, etc, etc. My mental model here is something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone">light cone</a> where provenance defines a specific path within the possible histories of the data, its counterpart would define the possible, or probable future path.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm mostly just looking for a good term because I think it would be useful, I‚Äôve been trying to mush different etymologies to find something that sounds okay but nothing great has come out of that yet. I‚Äôm not expecting there to be much work on really developing the notion concretely, but if there is I‚Äôd certainly love to know about it!</p>

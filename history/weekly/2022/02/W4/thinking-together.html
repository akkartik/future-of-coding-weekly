He's looking for examples where the visual interface looks like the thing it is modelling, and the spatial relationships model relationships in the modeled world. Programming using a map instead of a diagram. It's an issue I have with Blockly, that the two dimensional space is available, but not meaningful, and when it is meaningful the meaning is opaque, and we would be better off without it.</p>

It's not an either/or, or a single dimension. My personal view is that symbolic representation is good, but we deserve amazing symbols used in powerful ways. No current visual programming system does a good job of this. Most of them don't even bother introducing their own symbolic meanings ‚Äî they just put text in boxes, use color or shape to represent type information, and are exactly as static as textual languages. Shame.</p>

If you give one a program and a condition, they're designed to give you example states the program can get into that satisfy the condition, but they're more general than that. If you input a model that describes graphs generally, and encode a condition that corresponds to "branching factor of 5" then a model-checker will give you an example of such a graph. Many examples, if you ask for them!</p>

<p>Imagine if you told someone having difficulty learning to write that others are lacking vision for expecting them to type letters into a keyboard. It feels confusing to tell them to wait for a technology that doesn't exist yet. I'd say it does them a disservice.</p>
<p>I agree instead with your previous paragraph, that I quoted in my previous comment. We can only teach people what we know, though we can try to stage the concepts to be easier to learn. Anything else is research, something we have to learn ourselves before we can teach others.</p>
<p>It feels a little dissonant that the two diametrically opposed views are so close together. Did you intend them as separate ideas, covering the space of possibilities?</p>

One thing missing from this analysis is the qualitative change in the end result. Someone choosing whether to invest more in what they know vs what they don't shouldn't just be considering effort but also risk, the odds that the thing you end up with is broken in subtle ways that warp your sense-making. The classic example of this is the bugs found in the spreadsheet behind Reinhardt and Rogoff's influential paper: <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646"></a><a href="https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646">https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646</a></p>
<p>This is why Alan Kay harps on the right representation. The problem with pushing on excel for functions and tests and version control isn't just that they're harder, it's that it is harder to trust the results.</p>
<p>Which is not to say the right representation has to be text or anything. But advances in representation are few and far between. The ones we know how to use are the ones we should build bridges to lead everyone to. Otherwise we risk building bridges to nowhere.</p>

<p>We can (and I would say, should) flip this question around: what would programming look like if we considered "using" a computer no different from "programming" it?</p>

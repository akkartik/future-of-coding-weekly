(the opposite of fregean according to Pygmalion is analogical, which I find to be an overloaded term to use)</p>
<p>The first post is about Pygmalion (1975), the next one will be on an older but non-visual one. Trying to find where the limit of No-code lies ðŸ™‚</p>

Such a different take on visual programming.</p>
<p>I actually think just building a modern day pygmalion would be interesting. The actual implementation was a toy, but I actually donâ€™t see a reason this couldn't scale up. </p>
<p>One of the things I loved about the paper was them actually showing the underlying instructions.</p>

An important aspect of blackboard discussions is a shared conceptual vocabulary. And that is domain-specific. I suspect that Pygmalion-like systems should aim at being DSLs rather than "general purpose".</p>

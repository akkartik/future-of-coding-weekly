I was thinking of Tim Berners-Lee and Alan Kay. Berners-Lee might be recognizable, at least in name, but he is not a great explainer or popularizer. Kay is much better in this regard, but never reached a wider audience. The ones who come to mind are Herbert Simon and Allen Newell, but they went much further than CS. The YouTubers are interesting, and possibly the closest we have in CS to a Carl Sagan, I am afraid.</p>

The most widely popular ones are for fields like astronomy and physics where you can feel awe and wonder without much effort. Pop math exists, but is less popular, and still in inverse proportion to how much effort is needed to appreciate it. An astronomer can just put up a slideshow of cool pictures.</p>
<p>Any interesting applications of CS tend to require a lot of effort to appreciate, and/or be too abstract or too niche to catch lay interest. This is in no small part due to the state of the ecosystem, which obviously a lot of people here are working on fixing. E.g. cool visualizations are nice but tend to be obviously toys, raw coding in mainstream languages is hard to follow, lambda calculus can be beautiful but demands a lot of effort even from pros, etc. Where it's not mind-bendingly hard there's a bunch of accidental complexity.</p>
<p>I suspect linking CS concepts with problems that people intuitively understand is key, ideally with concrete results/outputs, that don't feel too artificial. A program format that lay people can grok would also be great, but I think if people can link the explanation of the code or whatever with the problem or other question, then they'll take it for granted and come back for more. Perhaps a platform that let you livecode a non-trivial game, maybe even a webapp, or some demo that made theoretical CS feel more practical than just moving symbols around. Honestly there probably exist people who could do the game thing in Love2D or something, but I don't know if lay people could follow. Live music coding is a (niche) thing, but I don't know how far you could take that in popularizing CS concepts beyond loops.</p>
<p>I'm kind of obsessing over live demos here, which is probably not the only way to do it. However, I do think interaction is the best way to make CS feel computational, showing multiple runs and changes to the program, and if the common scenario is "speaking engagement", well, there you go, you're doing it live. :)</p>

Physics and Maths have hundreds and hundreds of years of history, a cohesive story and a sense of foundational understanding. As Alan Kay says (or at least I think he says)... the closest thing we have to a fundamental CS law is LISP. Turing equivalence and all that.</p>

The blocks in Blockly all have a default textual representation. You could build a blockly plugin that allows the user to type, but everything is auto-completed to the text representation of the blocks that are currently available, so you can't type anything that doesn't generate blocks. new line creates a new block in the current stack, increasing and decreasing the indent moves the cursor in and out of stacks and fields. You could also allow the blocks to define their own alternative name for use in the auto-complete field, so you could type "rule", and you would auto-complete to "when we know <em><u> we also know </u></em>". Whatever you have currently entered shows up on a scratch-pad. Hit enter twice in a row, and whatever you currently have (including spaces you haven't filled in the text version) gets dropped onto the workspace for you. Targetting is hard, so to start I would say put the first one in the middle of the workspace, and if the user continues to type without scrolling, put subsequent entries below that one. I think that could work, and I think it could be written in such a way that it would work for anyone using Blockly, not just for a particular block set, as long as the blocks all have text on them. But it might be a good idea to add details to the block definitions for how the text version should read, since internal inputs and fields can be named pretty arcanely. I think it would be a really smart way to combat the "visual programming is not for experts" nonsense.</p>

Fairly standard code completion techniques may play well with a block language: just show me what blocks would likely fit here.  Two other surprisingly nice Scratch things: (1) you can change the selector popups for blocks in your well, giving them more of a tool/template feel, (2) double clicking on lone groups of blocks in the middle of your workspace executes them.  Now I'm reminded of Acme's middle click to execute code.</p>

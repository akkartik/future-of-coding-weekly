The video below is the prototype demo from 2016 when I was starting my VR programming company <a href="https://primitive.io"></a><a href="https://primitive.io">https://primitive.io</a></p>
<p>In this original version of our VR code visualization tool, the focus was on functional graphical building blocks of a simple RSA encryption algorithm written in Lisp. You can see function stacks in the animated runtime. The version that then became Primitive changed to focus on visualizing file system structure and class/method parsing. I would love to get back to function body parsing at some point again. Please let me know your thoughts:</p>

Like, consider the usual tired debate about income tax rates. One side wants to tax more as income grows, one side wants to tax less, both sides are obscenely self-interested, and the result is a raw negotiation without good faith. Lost is any sense of how best to build our society together. What if instead we pinned down a few criteria:</p>
<ul><li>A family of 4 making X should be able to have a budget that looks like Y.</li><li>A single parent raising children on food stamps should be able to have childcare.</li><li>...</li></ul><p>I think it'll probably be much easier to agree on these tests, and might make for a better foundation for debate. And if the laws start with scenarios, it'll make it easier to update them as well. We just ask if the tests are still passing, and if not we think about ways to rebalance our portfolio. Or we might ask if a refactoring of laws makes any of our scenarios break.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of how naive all this sounds. I just like thinking about it üôÇ One problem I can anticipate is that the negotiation may then happen over which scenarios we permit to be included..</p>
<p>Another related idea: what if we included tests in Ethereum code? It would add legitimacy to code changes and forks when bugs are discovered.</p>
<p>Sorry, probably off-topic for this thread. But you've gotten my imagination to soar üôÇ</p>

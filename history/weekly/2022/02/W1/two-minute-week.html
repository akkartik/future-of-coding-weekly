<p>This week I am working on <a href="http://Observablehq.com">Observablehq.com</a> backups to Github, using my browser based super debuggable serverless environment. Here is a video of me intercepting production requests in the real system, which is so valuable when integrating two systems you don't control and who both have various assorted security mechanisms. To be able to freeze time and step through a remote process... its a huge productivity booster for me. Some of the requests are initiated by Observable thumbnail generation process (this is how I trigger the automatic backup on new version feature), I can intercept the living system as it exists on the internet.</p>
<p>On the topic of functionality, I hope exporting code from observable automatically to Github will reduce some of the concern about vendor locking. The backups contain ES6 modules, a package.json for linking to npm, and an index.html which run a single notebook locally without Observable servers. Here is what backups look like <a href="https://github.com/endpointservices/observable-notebooks"></a><a href="https://github.com/endpointservices/observable-notebooks">https://github.com/endpointservices/observable-notebooks</a> (they use Observables export code functionality)</p>

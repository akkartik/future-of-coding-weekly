I‚Äôm wondering how, if at all, this little community has been using these LLMs and advanced chat bots. People are playing Pokemon in a text/CLI form just by asking ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play pokemon but with text and skip all the boring parts‚Äù*. I have to conclude that a number of you folks have made some crazy strides in the work you‚Äôve been doing or how you‚Äôve been refining your ideas with these tools.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve no interest in using these tools as they exist today because they‚Äôre tightly coupled with corporate interests I don‚Äôt wanna tangle with if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, they‚Äôre also way more focused on generative work than I think makes sense ‚Äî having a tool based around the same modeling but more focused on making things explainable; or elevating context would get me a lot more interested. </p>

<p><strong>@Eli Mellen</strong> I feel you here, and I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. I actually spent the $20 to get access to ChatGPT Plus just to see what it was like in comparison. With  <code>llama</code>  above, I actually have that running on my M1 air too! It works interestingly enough, but I don‚Äôt have that tuning brain yet to understand what I can change to get better results for what I‚Äôm trying to prompt for.</p>

<p>I'm also done some code translations, mostly to understand code written in a language I don't read as fluently. Also found it is pretty good at suggestion approaches I knew nothing about (like algorithms for graph layout),</p>
<p>I've got some ideas for integrating it into the editor I'm building, but that's still in too early of a phase. I think proactive rather than reactive usage is going to be a really interesting thing to explore. Copilot is cool and all, but I really want it focused on code I'm not currently writing</p>

<p>I'm building a layout system - the usual stuff; vertical and horizontal stacks.  I wanted to visualize the hierarchy of objects in the system.  Since I'm using ImGui, I asked ChatGPT for an ImGui tree.  This has 2 benefits; firstly, I can never remember the syntax/approach of doing this, 2nd, it gets me pretty close to what I want:</p>

You can ask it for examples of things, ask it to write text with citations, convert them to bibtex, etc.  It is a phenomenal starting point if you are writing a paper.  As you allude to though; it is only a starting point, and you can't trust it; you have to do the last confirmation/reading yourself.</p>
<p>From the code generation point of view, it is amazing how well things 'just work', and how easy it is to modify things - such as saying 'don't use smart pointers', and have it rewrite the code, etc.</p>

<p>I think this is teaching us about those small changes again in context being key.

Interestingly, GPT-4 seems worse at this with the same prompts. It's like it's more "sensible" and can't stop reminding me that the language isn't real, offering up alternative languages instead. eg: "Here's how you do this in Python." If you ask it to add a feature to the language, its jokes seem a bit more tame and 'corporate'. But maybe I need to adjust my prompts a bit for it.</p>

In this case though, I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that thanks to AI we are headed towards a renaissance of the humanities. </p>
<p>Today‚Äôs LLMs and other AI technology will likely cost many jobs. A few years ago many professional language translators had to look for other ways to earn money, not because translation technology finally became great. It was (and still is) just good enough, but it‚Äôs cheap, so that you can have stuff translated for (almost) free. If you don‚Äôt need or want a proper high-quality translation, you can use AI for that. The result will likely be average at best, but there are a lot of tasks where mediocre and cheap is superior to excellent and expensive. </p>
<p>I think the same will be happening to most written and graphical content, quickly followed by all kinds of media assets. For instance, game studios will for sure soon replace most designers with prompt engineers, perhaps first just for prototype assets, but it won‚Äôt be long until that‚Äôs good enough for a mediocre game to be published with such generated assets. On the plus side you could also see it that way: Soon you might be able to create your own game and don‚Äôt need to pay for any artists and still get some decent assets for it.</p>
<p>Of course, what happens to all those people out of their jobs? I don‚Äôt know. Some will perhaps switch from programming or writing or graphic design to prompt engineering and kind of do what they did before, but this time directing AIs instead of doing it themselves. Some will go into other industries, those that seem further away from being automated for now. And some will try to figure out what we as humans can still do better than AIs. And I think that is an extremely valuable idea to think about.</p>
<p>There is a chance for another renaissance. Good art has a deeply humanistic quality that I believe AI hasn‚Äôt cracked yet, and won‚Äôt until we get to AGI, which I‚Äôm certain is still relatively far away (I can go into detail why, but that‚Äôs probably for another thread). And I‚Äôm not just thinking about the kind of art that ends up in galleries and museums. Something you created yourself for a loved one can be a piece of art. A really well-designed product can also be a piece of art. Heck, even a really well-produced TikTok or YouTube video can be a piece of art. We know it, when we experience it. And the really good stuff won‚Äôt be just randomly falling out of an AI model, because to make the stuff that makes our hearts sing you need more than just a bunch of algorithms and a lot of processing power. What you need for that, we all have deep within us. </p>
<p>I have to say from my own experience, going through a programming education and working in the tech industry usually doesn‚Äôt help in revealing it, and often causes it to be buried instead (because profit, speed, efficiency, metrics, etc.). But if more of us who are technically capable also find their way back to what makes us human, we stand a good chance of figuring out how to coexist with the mediocre domain-specific wannabe-humans that AIs are today. And wouldn‚Äôt it be great to have all the mediocre stuff be dealt with, so we can focus on the great?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also keep a ChatGPT browser window open and experiment with it. I enjoy using it for use cases where I basically let it prompt me with clever questions to push my own creativity. Relying more on the muse than on the oracle. There‚Äôll be a lot of people that will happily jump on the automation use cases and have their dull work taken care of, I think Microsoft is setting that up quite effectively for the business world. But with the right mindset, a healthy amount of skepticism and distrust in the generated ‚Äúfacts‚Äù, and creativity in how to let LLMs play to their and our own strengths, there sure is lots of opportunity. The future is going to be wild.</p>

The question then becomes, how low can we drive the training requirements so that people mostly trained in/occupied with other stuff, say cooking, can produce software useful to them "on their own" (without having to pay someone for custom work, that is; let's not think to hard about an airtight definition).</p>
<p>There's an even messier sense of "a programmer" which is roughly "person who write things in text files that a computer interprets" which is possibly closer to what's meant in the "let non-programmers program" type of goal statement. However this category becomes less meaningful if those goals are satisfied, for roughly the reason <a href="https://twitter.com/TodePond">Lu Wilson</a> said, and has little inherent connection with the first definition, except as a function of our current tools which are still, in actual use, almost entirely about editing text files...</p>
<p>...mainly because successfully programing by editing text files takes a lot of training. Hmm.</p>

And I doubt this will ever be achieved with a single idea or tool. It will require domain-specific approaches.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry I've just realised that a 6-year-old using Scratch isn't actually a programmer - because they're not writing any text files that the computer interprets. They're actually a non-programmer. A better example of a programmer would be a 6-year-old using google docs.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry I'm just being facetious. But I do think that the definitions used around "programmer" are often more for gate-keeping or to elicit a reaction, rather than anything else - like in the referenced tweet :)</p>
<p>The idea of what a "programmer" is has changed over time and will continue to change, and they'll always be some resistance to that. Just like with any sort of change</p>

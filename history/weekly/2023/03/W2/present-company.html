I'd say:</p>
<ul><li>Try to make sure you understand why you're doing it, and that the reasons aren't rationalizations for something deeper.</li><li>Be clear-eyed about the cost and ROI. It's hard to not over-estimate ROI. Make sure it won't bankrupt you if the ROI is 0.</li><li>Be very open to dropping out half-way. We all have some stigma attached to it in our heads, but it's important to realize it's only in our heads. Getting a few years of grad school experience may well be the most important benefit of a PhD.

<p>I managed to finish, but it didn't really get me much more. I knew within a few years that most of the people in my field were working on problems I didn't care about, so I spent my summers doing internships and landed in industry.</p>
<p>So my #1 recommendation is to figure out before you apply who is doing work that you find exciting.</p>
<p>And since you're asking here, I'll assume your interests  are somehow related to building the "Future of Coding". It would be worth looking into why some of the top people in the FoC community have chosen to do independent research instead of following the typical academic route (e.g., Andy Matuschak), and how other people who are in academia have made it work (e.g., Philip Guo's Python Tutor).</p>

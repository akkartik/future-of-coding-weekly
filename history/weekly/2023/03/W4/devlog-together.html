But question for you allâ€¦do you think we should auto-generate the connectors as soon as blocks reference one another? Or should we let the user decide which blocks should have connectors? Hereâ€™s an example:</p>

<ul><li>there would be no functional difference</li><li>Nothing happens when a connection is created--currently itâ€™s just a visual cue because folks have said they wanted to see the relationship between blocks and how theyâ€™re connected</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-03-21T21:55:19.901Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Mattia Fregola</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-03-18&amp;toDate=2023-03-24&amp;channel=devlog-together&amp;filter=#2023-03-21T21:55:19.901Z" class="date">2023-03-21 21:55:19</a> <div class="message"><p>cool! then i'd probably test the following with the same users:</p>
<ul><li>automatically add the connection when a relation is created</li><li>remove the ability to add connections manually</li></ul><p>i also imagine there being some more explorations about the behaviour of connectors (and relationships) with tables with formulas with multiple inputs, e.g.</p>
<ul><li>from multiple columns</li><li>from different tables</li><li>from multiple columns from the same table</li></ul><p>i see a  high spaghetti-clutter risk there ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>(if it's a difficult build and you are able to mock it up, you could even test just the final state screens and ask users what they think each variations means)</p>

<p>the connectors remove the cognitive load of keeping track of what effects what in 2D space -- so my inclination would be to draw them always</p>
<p>also, if a user draws some but not others, that inconsistency is even more cognitive load, where the legibility of the graph now depends on a previous builder (or even yourself 2 months ago!) making the right choices in terms of which connector to manifest</p>

<ul><li>I and others have had success asking it to work step-by-step and talk out loud.</li><li>I've also had success asking it to provide a better answer after it answers.</li><li>I've tried doing a de Bono's Thinking Hats scenario to answer questions.</li></ul><p>I think there's some interesting work there to be done, especially regarding "frameworks". Like ask it to use a framework to answer the question. Ask it to use several different frameworks then synthesize a single answer.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, it tends to already know the framework. You don't have to program it in, you just have to ask it to use the framework.</p>
<p>I also don't know if there is any advantage to using multiple chats (that don't share history) to collaborate on an answer vs using a single chat with a single history.</p>

I can send ya a link to my toy app that lets you edit responses and prompts, save conversations. I‚Äôm experimenting with a ‚Äústrongly typed‚Äù conversation where each message is a call/response to itself that we can push along by requesting a new message from the conversation tip each time. Works particularly well when requesting implementations of snippets given a built up conversational context, and then saving each context line to edit and request variants repeatedly z</p>

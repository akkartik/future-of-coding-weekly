He‚Äôs the literal architect whose concept of patterns inspired the software patterns movement. In practice, Java enterprise software patterns are a lot of the past-of-code that we want to get away from. I‚Äôve read that Alexander thought that community missed the point, and from  <em>Timeless Way</em>  I believe it. From the first chapter he gets into the concept that people should be able to build their own buildings, that it doesn‚Äôt take extensive planning, and that it resonates with something very natural within us and within the world. I don‚Äôt want to say more as I really think you need to read it in context for it to sink in; but I‚Äôd recommend picking up a copy.</p>

I have read it vaguely in the light of future of code.</p>
<p>I think it's unclear whether he's right about us being able to tap into something within us to design our own buildings. It's an unfalsifiable claim because whenever someone can't design well, you can say they aren't tapping into it.</p>
<p>However, I do feel a lovely feeling swimming around when I read the book. I turn to it when I need to get out of the engineer's mindset and into a more holistic/intuitive sense of the world. I think we all have that sense, but it doesn't always express itself as architecture.</p>
<p>I would love to see someone like Alexander in our community, someone who can defy convention and build beautiful things by seeking the life and humanity in the thing.</p>
<p>And don't get me started about the patterns movement. Alexander says it was a failed experiment even in architecture, let alone in software engineering.</p>

<blockquote><p>The thing people who just look at patterns miss, is that Alexander himself renounced them. He said so plainly in 1996, at a keynote address to a room full of software developers; you can watch it yourself.</p>

<ul><li>~<em><em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em></em>~  and  ~<em><em>A City is Not a Tree</em></em>~  we‚Äôre starting out extremely mathematically, although he quickly picked up that something didn‚Äôt quite work.</li><li>~<em><em>A Timeless Way of Building</em></em>~  and  ~<em><em>A Pattern Language</em></em>~  explore the other extreme and look for practical ways to bring about the quality without a name through process and focus on the human side of building.</li><li>But even the patterns didn‚Äôt ultimately help people create what Alexander had in mind and so he tries to synthesize both extremes in his magnum opus  ~<em><em>The Nature of Order</em></em>~ .</li></ul><p>Alexander went through these three distinct periods in which he changed his thinking considerably. Unfortunately, his most well-known books are from the earlier periods. Many ideas in them Alexander himself has deemed obsolete, and he has improved on them in more recent but less familiar works, like  ~<em><em>The Nature of Order</em></em>~ .</p>
<p>If you want to read a little more about these periods, I recommend this article: <a href="https://patterns.architexturez.net/doc/az-cf-218793">patterns.architexturez.net/doc/az-cf-218793</a></p>

</li><li><p>Too many icons</p>

</li></ul><ul><li>Arrows appear to poke through walls instead of being attached to well-defined Ports (aka ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù)</li></ul><p>The system probably needs all of that detail, but, the reader should not be forced to read all of the details at once.

There's a certain sense where e.g. work tickets just trivially are continuations, but getting mileage out of the concept is tricky. Maybe someone here will make headway with it.</p>

It shows just how far we still have in expanding the linguistic side of programming. I don't think anyone has implemented it, but I think you can see the influence in Dynamicland's RealTalk. Its keywords Wish and Claim are both speech acts. The fact that dynamic land has effects in the actual world through its words makes this fact seem to be far from a coincidence. Sadly, Elephant 2000 isn't in Bret's list of papers, so I can't be certain he has read it, but I'd be surprised to find out this is an accident.</p>
<p>Definitely recommend reading Searle or Austin on speech acts. Searle is definitely less jargon heavy and incredibly readable.</p>

Kind of like Lisp with lists. Commercial implementations ride on that wave because it gives them interesting ways to optimize for parallel execution. But I think it‚Äôs an interesting design decision to basically treat everything as a collection and kind of look at a single scalar as an ‚Äúexception‚Äù and design a language around that.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2023-04-15T14:24:33.227Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Konrad Hinsen</span> <a href="./?fromDate=2023-04-12&amp;toDate=2023-04-18&amp;channel=thinking-together&amp;filter=#2023-04-15T14:24:33.227Z" class="date">2023-04-15 14:24:33</a> <div class="message"><p>Arrays as a primary data structure are interesting indeed, but the problem of the APL family has always been that arrays are its  <em>only</em>  data structure (in contrast to Lisp, that has other data structures besides lists). Nested/boxed arrays were a big step forward, but they remain limited and, together with the weak abstraction facilities, make APL a pain to use for many tasks. Add to this that typical implementations don't care about interfacing to the rest of the world, and you easily trap yourself in an island that is fascinating but limited.</p>
<p>However, as you say, the notion of plain values being a special case ("rank 0") of a uniform collection type is interesting and pratically relevant. It's what makes it difficult to implement APL ideas in other languages. This has been the main struggle in the early days of Numerical Python, when we tried to make Python scalars work as rank-0 arrays (and mostly failed). Later NumPy versions introduced its own scalar types for that reason, which have then been an eternal source of confusion for many users ("why is an element of a float array not a float?").</p>

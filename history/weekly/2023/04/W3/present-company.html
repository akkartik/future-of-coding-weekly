It's for a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fullstackfargo/events/292846647/">local (Fargo, ND) developer meet-up</a>. I tried to steer towards the practical implications as much as I could since we have a pretty diverse (in terms of interest and skill-set) audience.</p>

I think one of the biggest things people need to get into philosophy is something that feels real and interesting to them. If I had to pick the absolutely most accessible text it might be "On Bullshit" by Harry Frankfurt. Super short (67 pages) and pretty good. Or a fun paper is Peter Van Inwagen's paper on Time Travel without paradox. <a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past.pdf">andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past.pdf</a></p>
<p>But really I think it's more about what people find interesting. Some people have religious motivations or social issues, or politics, or tech etc. Feel free to DM if you want to chat about potential books or papers on a particular topic.</p>

<p>What has been happening is that I end up providing like 10 mins of context that was left out of the paper and just assumed the audience would know‚Ä¶ looking at you Naur‚Ä¶</p>

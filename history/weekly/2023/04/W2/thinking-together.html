<p>I mean, a program changing over time is kind of how beta reduction is technically defined, right? Transformation from one lambda term to the next. The problem is, implementations using that strategy aren't (IMO) really feasible. They're not efficient, and there tends to be ambiguity as to the next step, where IIRC different choices determine whether the thing even converges.</p>
<p>One of my goals is a computational formalism that efficiently supports partial evaluation and this sort of program -&gt; program mindset in general. (Key point: you want to be able to output "data", therefore data is a program)</p>
<p>I'm not precisely sure what you mean by the forkable database trend. Can you give an example? I feel like I've heard of a couple different things that answer that description in very different ways.</p>

There‚Äôs no reason we shouldn‚Äôt be able to fork, edit, undo &amp;amp; redo running programs (and archive them) just as we do with static ones.</p>

<p>You could explicitly treat the input as an event stream, and treat the program as a reducer over that stream. It does get interesting when that input depends on program output that depends on previous input.</p>

Because of this, creating clones/forks and storing snapshots/images of both state and logic is trivial. Diffing and merging should be possible too, but obviously come with their caveats.</p>
<p>Currently one use case I'm thinking for this would be stateful cloud functions. It should be easy and fast to write the snapshot to a persistent storage and then load it when the function needs to run, and then write the possibly changed version back to wait for the next run. Keeping the snapshots in storage would work as a free history of the program state (and logic) that you'd be able to open up in the structure editor. Of course, it won't just scale to infinity size persistent data and handling concurrent requests would be an extra hurdle. However, it should work fairly well for what is usually required of cloud functions. It is also able to keep much of the interpreted intermediate results and only recompute what's necessary.</p>
<p>Emitting some kind of "rewind" messages to external systems still wouldn't be easy, but could be possible by diffing the snapshots and then constructing the rewind message from the diff..</p>

Part of my point with Magic Hands is to stimulate more ideas for getting away from standard keyboard, mouse and touch interactions, as Bret was trying to encourage in his article.

<p>Ben Moseley &amp; Peter Marks • Out of the Tar Pit</p>
<p>𒂶 <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/063">futureofcoding.org/episodes/063</a></p>
<p><a href="https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/papers/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf">Out of the Tar Pit</a> is in the grand pantheon of great papers, beloved the world over, with just  <em>so much influence</em> . The resurgence of Functional Programming over the past decade owes its very existence to the Tar Pit’s snarling takedown of mutable state, championed by Hickey &amp; The Cloj-Co. Many a budding computational philosophizer — both of yours truly counted among them — have been led onward to the late great <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/062">Bro86</a> by this paper’s borrow of his  <em>essence</em>  and  <em>accident</em> . But is the paper  <em>actually</em>  good? Like, really — is it  <em>that</em>  good? Does it hold up to the blinding light of hindsight that 2023 offers? Is this episode actually an April Fools joke, or is it a serious episode that Ivan just delayed by a few weeks because of life circumstances and his own incoherent sense of humour? I can’t tell.</p>
<p>Apologies in advance. Next time, we’re going back to our usual format to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL">Intercal</a>.</p>

You can't even use formal reasoning. The run-state of the code is so far removed from what you wrote, you can't look at the source code and say "oh, here's where I made it racist.". That is a programming that informal reasoning doesn't work for. It requires that you are building systems that build systems, of course, and that it is the system two turtles down you are concerned with understanding. But still, I think it fits?</p>

Now challenge #2. In Blawx, it would be trivial to take a test, and generalize the inputs of that test by making them abducible, and run the query again. The answer to that second query would be a set of models, with constraints on unground variables, in which the query holds. Essentially, a description of all inputs that would have made your test pass. But of course, there is no reason to have the extra step of starting with a grounded test. You can go straight to the most general query, and say "give me all the inputs for which the following assertion holds." But technically, I think that's an example of #2. The system could answer "that test passes, because it is an example of this model, anything in that model would work. Also, here are all the other models that work." It's also the reason I'm really excited about its potential as a tool for generating tests that can be used to validate the legal reasoning of other systems.</p>

A lot of overlap with my own thoughts/projects over the last few years.</p>
<p>My own perspective is a bit different, as I am coming from scientific research rather than software development. As you hint at in a few places, research has always been done with failure in mind. As was scientific computing in its early days, when machines and software were tailor-made for us.</p>
<p>Then the commodification of hardware and software happened, and scientists became increasingly pressured to adopt these commodity tools, and with them the attitudes of professional software engineers. In parallel, scientists were forced to adapt to project-based funding schemes that punish (visible or admitted) failure.</p>
<p>I have bookmarked your slides for another read with an in-depth study of the references. More later...</p>

<p>I agree that a progress indicator is necessary.</p>
<p>IMM, text toollng is 2 parts</p>
<p>Creating and editing text</p>
<p>Displaying text</p>
<p>This tool does (2) very well.  Youtube, hip-hop, songwriting all indicate that the audience wants less text and compressed content.</p>
<p>My favourite for (1) is Keynote (MacOS, probably Powerpoint, too, but, I don’t know).  Keynote is a REPL for content creation.  You edit text, Keynote changes the font size on the fly and you get immediate feedback on whether your text has too many words in it.  Keynote, though, then tangles (1) and (2) together resulting in bloatware (images of slides), instead of separating the two aspects.</p>
<p>The best analysis of textual prose that I’ve seen is Pat Pattison’s work. There are ways to write text that result in more interesting text.  Pattison analyzes and narrows it down.  Pattison, ostensibly, talks about songwriting. Songwriting is about writing compressed text, how to punch it up and how to make it memorable.</p>

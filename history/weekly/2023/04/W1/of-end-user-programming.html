At heart, I feel it should be like they're "casting spells" over reality (or virtual reality). This tips into the area of cognitive modelling: how close the physical manifestation needs to be to be able to be abstracted up to a satisfying cognitive model that matches the human's intention. In other words, you cast a spell "make that banana green!" and it comes back a lurid dayglo green, that would be a cognitive dissonance because really, you'd expect to simply get a very unripe-looking banana. What are the elements of this formalised spell-casting, this "programming system"? You have objects (banana, this one, not all ones), attributes (green, the correct one!), a sense of time or evolution (went from yellow to green). You start to get into Roget's Thesaurus land: what are the key concepts for describing the world, our human world?</p>
<p>Anyway, just a splat of the stuff buzzing around my head right now. Thoughts?</p>

<ul><li>Formalization, i.e. adding precision and dealing with corner cases.</li><li>Mapping it on the capacities of an existing machine.</li></ul><p>It's easy to image full automation of 2., although we don't quite have it. Will LLM's help with that, in a sufficiently reliable way to be useful? Time will tell.</p>
<p>It's 1. that is really interesting. It requires adding information to the initial informal description. For common problems with known solutions, LLMs could fill that in. But will they be sufficiently aware of their own limits to say "I can't do this"? Time will tell.</p>

The conversation itself is the "programming" and the "language".</p>
<p>So I think where I'm going with these thoughts is, is it enough to simply have a chat history iterating towards an English (etc) language description of the program under evolution? What amount of formalisation, and precision, will now be needed after all? Could it be that we end up iterating in natural language over a, I don't know, graphical representation?</p>

That will involve representing cognitive elements in a consistent way - so you have basic values (basically, strings), then structures like lists and maps or object-like types, then some concept of change or evolution. You'd want these elemental concepts to be represented consistently between chat "app evolution" sessions. All shown as widgets or cells or tables or trees or even ... nodes and wires!</p>

<p>It's 1. that is really interesting. It requires adding information to the initial informal description. For common problems with known solutions, LLMs could fill that in. But will they be sufficiently aware of their own limits to say "I can't do this"? Time will tell.</p>

The conversation itself is the "programming" and the "language".</p>
<p>So I think where I'm going with these thoughts is, is it enough to simply have a chat history iterating towards an English (etc) language description of the program under evolution? What amount of formalisation, and precision, will now be needed after all? Could it be that we end up iterating in natural language over a, I don't know, graphical representation?</p>

That will involve representing cognitive elements in a consistent way - so you have basic values (basically, strings), then structures like lists and maps or object-like types, then some concept of change or evolution. You'd want these elemental concepts to be represented consistently between chat "app evolution" sessions. All shown as widgets or cells or tables or trees or even ... nodes and wires!</p>

But there's always a good question here of how objective some doctrine separating patterns and anti-patterns is. If you're not opinionated enough then the things people can create (with the mechanisms you provide) hit complexity limits sooner. If you are too opinionated you turn people off who might work differently than you but no less effectively.</p>
<p>Early RoR seems like a nice case study in hitting a sweet spot of opinionated-ness.</p>

Fewer people are motivated by perfection than are motivated by progress. Systems that only let you do it right make it harder to do anything at all, and harder to learn, which injures popularity. We learn by trial and error, not by reading docs. Feedback, not guardrails. By the time you know Python well, doing functional programming in Python is easier than learning Haskell. &lt;/opinion&gt;</p>

For instance, systems deliberately aimed at newer users (consider Scratch) or narrow use cases (e.g. scripting DSL for a particular app) have a good case for being opinionated. Something to build a whole business on, less so, largely for reasons Jason laid out.</p>
<p>Also, even leaving aside the subjectivity, what constitutes a good or bad pattern is (at least in some cases) dependent on the system and all its interactions, particularly interactions with complicated stuff like human habits and attention. So you don't necessarily know at design time what you want to encourage. Unless, you know, it's a 1-1 analog with a pattern that produces security vulns across ecosystems or somesuch, then you probably want to avoid making that the path of least resistance...</p>

A +tool+ should make anti-patterns painful - yes.  A +tool+ should not make hard things possible.  My ideal +environment+ is one which allows me to choose the most appropriate paradigm/tool for the sub-problem that I want to think about.  That ideal environment should make it easy to compose solutions to uber-problems by plumbing sub-solutions together, regardless of the paradigm used.  To make hard things possible, I should be able to use Assembler (line-oriented or tree-oriented (Assembler, C, etc. vs ASTs, CSTs, Lisp)) and bolt these bits into the overall solution.  The last time I touched such an environment, was the UNIX command-line (#!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/env node, #!/usr/bin/env python, etc., etc.).  The problems with the UNIX Shell are (1) it over-specifies (!) the format of IPCs by insisting that the special byte 0x0a terminate every blob of IPC bytes, and, (2) the Shell‚Äôs insistence on using 1D notation (sequential characters, leading to the unrealistic restriction that commands have exactly one input and exactly two outputs (the UNIX kernel allows more of each, but the shell does not encourage this)).</p>

Maybe comment out deletions: not great style in real code, but helps show the whole diff while still being copy-pastable. Unified diffs or whatever are hard to read and highlighting alone is not adequate IMO (and not always possible)... Otherwise I'm not quite sure what the question is.</p>
<p>For reference, Bob went really hard with how he handled code in "Crafting Interpreters". <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/">journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters</a> It's all worth reading IMO, but Ctrl-F "build system" if you want to focus on the code part. :)</p>

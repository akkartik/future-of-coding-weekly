I personally haven't read it. I hear most people like it as a reference. A book I have read (a good chunk of) that I can highly recommend is crafting interpreters. While on the face it isn't about compilation, the second half of the book you compile to a bytecode vm that you build.</p>
<p>My advice is to look for books where most of the book is not spent in parsing. For some reason, there is an obsession in compiler books with parsing. It is usually not that important and is such a small part of the language.</p>
<p>One book I just ordered but haven't read yet that looks really nice is Engineering A Compiler.</p>
<p>Also happy to chat about compilers anytime. I'm relatively new to them as well, but now working on a JIT compiler in my day job, I'm learning a lot faster.</p>

(I am a bit busy because we're moving through a new house this month here in the Netherlands). I only have a big chunk of friday and the saturday and sunday early mornings to work on my project .. so working on a jit compiler at work full-time is very nice I can imagine for sure!</p>

Wirth's  <em>Compiler Construction</em>  is a beautiful gem of a book, though perhaps a bit dated by now. The Dragon Book is a classic, but I think it works better in a teaching setting than for self-study. SICP intros this topic very well, but contains loads of other stuff that would turn it into a lengthy side quest.</p>
<p>Much as Jimmy has recommended that you skip a bunch of parsing stuff, it sounds like your use case doesn't need a bunch of the normal code generation techniques, as what you're building is what we used to call a  <em>translator</em>  (rather than a  <em>compiler</em> , which is a translator from a higher to a lower level language). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

Where a parser is a tree growing out of a stream ‚Äî and at its most interesting a typo dirty stream ‚Äî compiling is mostly more about transforming a tree.</p>
<p>Speaking of beasts, when first, and with little understanding, I was curious about this at school, I was hoping for the Dragon Book and got Pierce's Types and Programming Languages, which served me better in the end.</p>
<p>For compiling, I always liked the Nanopass project for its clarity <a href="https://nanopass.org/documentation.html">nanopass.org/documentation.html</a>.  For parsing, monadic ones get a person in a particularly good frame of mind, and Ohm <a href="https://ohmjs.org/">ohmjs.org</a> is the nicest tool I've come across.</p>

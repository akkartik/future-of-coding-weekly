For context, I spend a lot of time in tools like Houdini, Solidworks, Cavalry, and After Effects. Some of them have more access to computation than others, but the biggest difference between those and Processing or threejs is a large ‚Äústandard library‚Äù of functions. </p>
<p>On the other hand, building a website with live feedback or scripting in a REPL seem like a very different experience from just writing the same code in notepad. I wonder if visual programming is all just ‚Äúdebug views‚Äù rather than the specific presence of a GUI. And if so, what does that mean for generalized visual languages or environments?</p>

<p>Not sure it's just about "debug views" as you can achieve visual debug views using conventional coding with external tooling - such as <a href="https://appmap.io">appmap.io</a></p>
<p>For me, the fact the "building" phase being visual has big advantages too</p>

<p>For me, the draw of programming systems that offer more than the normal REPL loop, or compile cycle, is that they empower novel, or deeper understandings of how a program functions.</p>
<p>This can take on so many different forms, and varies depending on the goal and the audience.</p>
<p>I think different sorts of liveliness in a programming system can help to promote different sorts/scales of understanding.</p>

For source code transformations, I imagine robust automatic error handling stemming from the fact that most transformations are somewhat compositional, I mean the action on the whole text is sort of a combination on the action of the parts  <code>f(text) = f(text.some_part) ** f(text.some_other_part)</code> .</p>
<p>In as much as LLMs "think" and "are creative", I'd say it comes from the attempt to find the "conceptual space" defined by the training text.  Here the core transformation is from some chunk of text to the next chunk plus some attention data structure that gets updated along the way.</p>

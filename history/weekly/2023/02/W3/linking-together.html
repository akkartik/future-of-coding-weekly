In the most charitable version of this, it is just Kant's view dressed up with some "science" to back it. In the worst it is a global skepticism that is self defeating.</p>
<p>He definitely isn't blowing any empiricists out of the water, but just repeating things philosophers have explored in much more depth and rigor elsewhere.</p>
<p>To try to be concrete, the argument in the TED talk is just bad.</p>
<p> I ran a game theory simulation and found that in my simulation reality tracking was not the most fit setup. In the simulation, the non-reality tracking "organisms" out competed all. Therefore, in actual reality we don't track reality."</p>
<p>There are so many steps missing here. hopefully it is clear that this isn't a valid argument.</p>
<p>But it also becomes a mess when applied to itself. The evolution that "follows these equations" is the evolution in the phenomenal world, the world as we see it (the desktop in his metaphor). But what we are interested in is not that evolution, but the real evolution, the one that actually shapes our cognitive faculties. Why think it obeys these equations? By this very commitment, we have no access to that evolution. So, we have no reason to think it follows the equations.</p>
<p>So when coming to accept this view, we get an undercutting defeater (a belief that undermines the support we had) for the very belief we just adopted. Once we adopt this interface view, we realize we didn't see Evolution, we saw the Interface that we call evolution and have no reason to think this is the evolution of reality, it is merely the evolution of our interface. Therefore, it does not follow that Evolution causes us not to see reality.</p>

<p>There is a you and a me, we aren't just interface constructs. We can't trust our perceptions, but consciousness is consciousness and death is death. And if you have life and death, you still have evolution and fitness. Organisms reproducing to create new consciousness is not just an interface construct. I don't (yet) see how this is self-defeating.</p>
<p>If somebody showed how the laws of physics emerge from the laws of a cellular automaton, I'd call that science. It's a model that explains observations, that you can use to make predictions. Did Newton or Einstein do anything more? An equation is just a kind of model.</p>
<p>A lot of modern models have a lot of variables, which brings in questions of are we just p-hacking. But that doesn't refute model-building as an endeavor. It seems to me that persuasive models are the currency of science, along with data.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, in the second link he says he's trying to find the underpinnings of evolution, which feels a bit woo. I'm not sure how you would do science on that question. He gives up all the experiments and theorems he's built up over the last 20 years and now has to start from scratch. I'm gonna read his book to better understand the plan of work.</p>

<p>On his view everything is interface, because that's the only thing we have access to. We have no access to the world at all. Our cognitive faculties are not mapped to truth at all. Nothing we know is true. As for why this statement is interface? Organisms are things that exist in space and time. As he tells us, space and time don't exist. They are interfaces. So if organisms exist in space and time and space and time don't exist, organisms don't exist.</p>
<p>If I'm honest, this kind of stuff bothers me so much. I see it as pure sophistry. I truly recommend reading Kant or Berkeley, or James or Pierce or Rorty, or Putnum or any philosopher in the Kantian or pragmatist bent over this stuff.</p>

<p>We do have access to the world -- through math. He's making the strongest case I've yet seen for model building over empiricism, reason over the senses.</p>
<p>Why would I read philosophers  <em>over</em>  this? They don't make testable predictions, he does. It's apples and oranges. It's super useful to see points of agreement and contradiction, but I don't see one side obviating the other.</p>

<p>That said, the logical conclusion of Hoffman's argument is that you can't reliably test Hoffman's argument, having no transhuman means to do so. The same situation occurs with "brain in vat"/simulationist (and similar back to Plato) thought experiments.</p>
<p>So, some of us decide (philosophically) that we're going to rely on the evidence of our senses because it's the best we can do as agents in the world (Heidegger). After which, all the standard cog-sci limits of perception/cognition stuff that's already in the textbooks applies, plus a steady stream of new and fascinating findings. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>My main issue with "brain in a vat" is that it's uninteresting. A dead end in thinking and exploring. At the opposite end (as I see it), there's Terence Deacon's teleodynamics theory (see his book "Incomplete Nature"). Not quite empirically testable right now, there's a lot of preliminary work to be done, but empirically testable in principle, and I am confident that the road to there will yield interesting insights.</p>

However, it seems clear to me that:</p>
<p> <em>The full generality of his theory is not needed by his experiments, and not testable with similar experiments.</em> </p>
<p>The screenshot below feels like a representative example of the sorts of perceptions his experiments evolve. It shows the organism's perceptions "folding" the real resource level around its optimum desired level of some resource. This seems reasonable. But it doesn't seem reasonable or testable to go from "the perceptual space is not identical to the world space" to "there is no world space," to focus on just one of his broader claims. As a concrete example, I have a hard time imagining the world not being a metric space (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space</a>). Hoffman would agree that even if there isn't really a lion, there's something that can affect your fitness -- and this something "moves" unlike the static resource. More precisely, your perception of where you are is decoupled from the fitness of this location. This bank of the river has high fitness if the lion's on the other side, but low fitness if the lion's on the same side.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine any static mapping from a non-metric space to a metric space being consistently adaptive, i.e. consistently yielding good fitness. I think the null hypothesis here should be that selection will tend towards noisy but unbiased mappings when it comes to space simply because of the wide variety of scenarios an organism will get into in its life. Perceived distance will correspond to real distance. It's hard to imagine a world in which this null hypothesis is false. (Though I did ping Greg Egan in hopes of nerdsniping him to come up with one[2].)</p>
<p>Obviously, further comments and refutations most appreciated, both on the conclusions and on the means by which I arrived at them. I don't science/critical-think too good.</p>

<p>Basically I'm trying to get at least a rough sense for how Hoffman's lay language "there's no space" might be meaningful. Wolfram wouldn't say there's no space, I think, just that 3D space at large scales is an emergent property of a very different space. </p>
<p>If space just has more dimensions than we perceive, that doesn't feel like justification to say there is no space in the world. Projection feels like a familiar transform.</p>
<p>However, if the transform is much more complicated, such as the one described in <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wangs-carpets">akkartik.name/post/wangs-carpets</a>, then the statement starts to seem meaningful.</p>

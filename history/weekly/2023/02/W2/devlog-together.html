Does the paragraph form seem "better"? Took a surprising amount of work, because I had to abandon the NLG being done by the reasoner and write my own version that knows how to deal with nested terms. I'm thinking the new one is probably better for validation, worse for debugging, but I'm not sure.</p>

Not even just for rephrasing, because I can't control how badly the NLG was drafted. And I prefer the first one, too. But then again, I like the raw output from the reasoner, too. So I'm the wrong audience. ðŸ˜‰</p>

If I generated the input text, I would agree. I might even try it for my own encodings where I can control the input text. Because I can avoid doing things that are going to confuse it. But in my larger context, my users are generating the small parts of NLG for each predicate that are being combined to generate explanations, and I can't rely on them not to generate text that will confuse it. Tonnes of potential, I agree, but my tool's virtues are correctness and explanations linked causally to authoritative source material. Natural-sounding text, if it even slightly risks those virtues for a subset of users, is not a virtue. Besides, if my users want ChatGPT to rewrite the explanations they get from my tool, that's why it has an API. :)</p>

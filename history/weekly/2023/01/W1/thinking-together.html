I'll use an example to elucidate:</p>
<p>Take a rectangle of base  <code>b</code>  and height  <code>h</code> . It's common to think of these as "independent" variables and define quantities like the following as "dependent":</p>
<ul><li><code>perimeter(b, h) =&gt; 2*(b+h)</code></li><li><code>area(b, h) =&gt; b*h</code></li><li><code>diagonal(b, h) =&gt; sqrt(b^2+h^2)</code></li></ul><p>But if I were to ask, what are the base and height of a rectangle whose area is  <code>a</code>  and diagonal is  <code>d</code> , our programming languages have no tooling to do this (except the symbolic manipulation libraries for computer algebra). All the required information is there but we have privileged  <code>b</code>  and  <code>h</code>  over  <code>area</code>  and  <code>diagonal</code>  and thus, we now need to figure out the formula for side lengths and program it as the function  <code>sides(a, d)</code> </p>
<p>I should be able to describe a structure, and auto-generate all possible functions (including for currying and partial applications, and while we are at it, all the partial derivatives with respect to each other) so that i can just declare what is known and what I want to calculate. A rectangle can then be represented with any set of variables that make everything else determinable. I should get access to all possible constructors like   <code>new Rectangle(area: a, diagonal: d)</code> .</p>
<p>And I want to see this be available for all programming tasks, not just algebra/math. For creating a graph, is the constructor  <code>new Graph(Nodes[], Edges[])</code>  really the privileged one? Why not build languages in a way that I automatically get the constructor  <code>new Graph(AdjacencyMatrix)</code>  and the instance methods  <code>graph.getNodes()</code>  and  <code>graph.getEdges()?</code> </p>

Another example:  <code>~_*range{start.inclusive, end.exclusive, domain is int{0..30}, end=start+length, midpoint?, length?}*_~</code>  ; By using constraints to define relations, and invertable/full on algebraic operations; an expression could be automatically reworked to isolate different set of variables; and provide ability to change them. Eg, here, changing the length will lead to an ambiguous case (&gt;1 free variable), but with a structural editor, it may show all possible interpretations for you to select (eg. keep end or start fixed, or scale track around certain point, or add custom interpretation logic (eg. using non-linear scaling)). Integrating this system deeply with the UI would allow pretty much auto-generation of it just from the expression/range concept, auto supporting all interaction (drag track, endpoints, scale around scalepoint, etc), which would otherwise have been pages of code in eg. current web development...</p>

Here's a model I haven't seen before:  <em>shared game-playing</em> .</p>
<p>How it would work:</p>
<ul><li>The rules for a "game" of some kind are expressed as a code library... or whatever representation works best.</li><li>A set of "players" (processes or threads) express interest in playing the game with each other. (somehow...)</li><li>The players communicate with each other by interacting with the game (in accordance with its rules), and receive information about each other's actions by observing how the game state has changed.</li></ul><p>The "game" could be an  <em>actual</em>  game like chess or Factorio (implemented via peer-to-peer communication), or it could be a standardized protocol like HTTP, FTP, or (most commonly) it could be an application-specific protocol that would normally be implemented via message-passing or RPC.</p>
<p>Imagine if this were the only model of communication that a programming language exposes. What if it were the "building block" of communication ‚Äî the only way to build concurrent systems? I think it's an intriguing thought ü§î. I'm surprised I haven't heard this model proposed before.</p>
<p>(This post was inspired by <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/">Syndicate</a>, which is an actor-based PL that eschews message-passing and RPC for the idea of a "data-space" that actors use to exchange information. But unlike my proposal above, Syndicate's data-spaces don't contain  <em>rules</em> , and thus cannot be used to model video games or communication protocols.)</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/andrewf">Andrew F</a> Yes, this model is definitely somewhat reminiscent of session types and tuple spaces. The motivation for making it a primitive is the same as the motivation for putting session types into a programming language ‚Äî to allow users to write programs against a known interface, and to allow the computer to check that the interface is being used correctly. RPC (in a statically-typed language) is an ultra-simplistic example of this ‚Äî it models one action, followed by one response.</p>

<p>Also, re state machine replication: yeah, I'm guessing the fault tolerant server stuff is what Chris was referring to. Communication is a big part of fault tolerance. From the perspective of designing abstractions, it probably looks more like a potential implementation detail, but it will constrain what kinds of "games" can run over an unreliable (i.e. real) network.</p>

For example, if you think your game needs the "relay" architecture that Croquet uses, you can implement that at the game level. Instead of writing a game that clients play with each other directly, you write a game that the clients play with the relay.</p>

I'm envisaging a programming language wherein you write these "games" using Datalog-style rules, which are partially ordered. Tuples would be stratified by timestamps similar to how it's done with Dedalus (I've been working on a generalization). Then, much of the explicit coordination logic is handled by the language runtime ‚Äî e.g. the actual exchanging of messages between game-players. But there is always going to be  <em>some</em>  logic ‚Äî such as fault-tolerance ‚Äî which must be written into the game itself, because there is no blessed solution that will work for all games. For example, how to handle unresponsive players should be up to the game. Maybe the game waits indefinitely, maybe there's a timeout, or maybe the other players have to vote the unresponsive player out. (Standard mechanisms could be offered as  <em>libraries</em> , but not as language-level constructs.)</p>

What‚Äôs built-in is the notion of stratification by inductive types (think Haskell ADTs), of which the natural numbers are a special case. Stratifying by natural numbers allows you to model linear time, but you can also stratify by other structures, which allows you to model bottom-up (memoized) recursion, a.k.a. ‚Äúdynamic programming‚Äù. So my proposed semantics for time is also a semantics for provably terminating (or productive) non-monotonic recursion ‚Äî something Datalog is sorely missing üòá. Concretely: this means you can model any iterative or recursive computation that you‚Äôd perform in an imperative language, by defining a (possibly non-linear) ‚Äúvirtual machine‚Äù that executes it. The state of the machine can be observed by supplying ‚Äútimestamps‚Äù for the steps you want to observe. (For a dynamic programming algorithm, these steps are the cells of the table.) The end result is a  <em>de facto</em>  Turing-complete programming language built upon Datalog semantics.  <em>De facto</em>  because it‚Äòs impossible to crash or hang your program ‚Äî unless you invoke a computation that takes a long-but-finite time to resolve. For any Haskellers reading this: the semantics is a generalization of ‚Äúrecursion schemes‚Äù.</p>
<p>This may or may not make sense to anyone. I‚Äôll be able to explain it properly once I‚Äôve finished putting together the prototype. It might sound  <em>complicated</em> , but I‚Äôve been working on a syntax that (I hope) makes it feel simple. (And debuggers that  <em>visualize</em> these dynamic processes are going to be important too.)</p>
<p>This stratification scheme would be a very general way to drive the ‚Äúgames‚Äù I‚Äôve been talking about üòá. It‚Äôs a means of specifying partially-ordered  <em>non-monotonic</em>  computations.</p>
<p>(Apologies to readers who don't know what "monotonic" or "stratified" means. These are terms from the logic programming community. You'll encounter them in most Datalog tutorials.)</p>

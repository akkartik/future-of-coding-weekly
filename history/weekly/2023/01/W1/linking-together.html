<p>How many different productivity apps do you use for your daily work? Would it be possible to build one to rule them all?</p>
<p>Personally, I keep a weekly diary in OneNote to track most of my ongoing work. Somehow, knowledge work seems to resist being formalized into a single structured framework. (Or maybe that's just my own semi-scattered process.)</p>

<p>The Unix philosophy doesn't really work in the current ecosystem, and no one is incentivized to make it work. Interop requires a common language, and a common language is a lot of work to make it easier for your customers to stop paying you.</p>
<p>You end up wanting "apps" to all be frontends to a common (user-owned) datastore that none of them control and is in constant schema flux. Who builds this nightmare? (yes, it's us lunatics, I know)</p>

<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if there were fewer barriers between programs?</p>
<p>This comes up in many places, whether it‚Äôs this article, the retro/minimalist computing community (100rabbits‚Äò uxn fantasy processor comes to mind), the desire for Steam to circumvent windows account separation so it can share game downloads across multiple accounts, and I‚Äôm sure many others.</p>
<p>The problem, imo, is that any system that connects to the internet at all treats all applications as potential adversaries to one another and the user (and rightfully so). So programs are sandboxed as much as possible.</p>
<p>This separation means that at the operating system level (and before that, in the designers‚Äò minds), there would need to be well-designed APIs to share data between programs (and a permission model to go along with them).</p>
<p>Web 2.0, with its mostly open REST APIs, got the sharing part right, but not the permissions. Or maybe it did, but the consequence was that you (the proprietor of a web 2.0 service) would pay to host part of a competitor‚Äôs functionality, which isn‚Äôt a thing investors like, I guess.</p>

<p>Something else worth exploring IMO is IPFS-based immutable data as the foundation. This would drastically reduce the number of mutable storage locations that require access control, and thus enable protection around the mutability points, rather than sandboxing the tools.</p>

I believe the major cloud vendors are converging toward a model that uses a single common location for data, all of which is stored in open data formats and can be queried from anywhere. That's generally what enterprise customers want.</p>
<p>But I don't see how the model would work for consumer software. The two main challenges I see are:</p>
<ul><li>Schema changes are difficult to implement without explicit coordination from all of the applications that use a particular data set.</li><li>A single buggy application could ruin all your data. Presumably the model would allow different permission levels for different applications, but the average user isn't going to put any effort into managing permissions (or even understand what they mean).</li></ul><p>Perhaps the default would be that applications only have permission to read data that they've written, with the option to explicitly share data. That would work great for me, but for people who don't want to become data engineers in their free time, it seems like they'll just stick to the defaults. And then they won't get many benefits over the current walled garden model.</p>

I just wonder how many people are able to appreciate it.</p>
<p>What I see personally as the most important achievement is to turn  <code>scmutils</code>  into readable literate documents. It's probably the first computer algebra system that invites its users to explore its inner workings.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre also working on seamless transfer of projects between Clerk and Maria to allow a collaborative web-based interface to these documents. Sam‚Äôs dream is a kind of real-time collaborative student wiki to mob-program and (more importantly) mob-understand scientific material.</p>

Sounds very good! As does a collaborative interface. This is the kind of advanced material that motivated students could well figure out for themselves in a group setting. Perhaps better than with a teacher, given the small intersection (and thus paucity of teachers) between competences in advanced mechanics and Clojure programming.</p>
<p>Now I just have to install a Clojure environment on my laptop to play with this during train rides...</p>

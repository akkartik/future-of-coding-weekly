<p>Each symbol instance will need its own sense of time. When looking at a particular instance, all child instances will execute "infinitely fast" to simulate continuous time semantics. All parent instances will execute discretely, only when necessary to satisfy the needs of the currently observed instance.</p>
<p>The GUI, including things like pulling a point off an edge, would be the ur parent of the simulation hierarchy. So if it were possible to run time backwards <em>outside</em> the GUI level, your editing interactions would gradually be undone, and that pulled point would hop back onto the edge where you pulled it off, right at the moment that you had pulled it (since the flow of time of the points-and-edges simulation is happening <em>inside</em> the GUI).</p>
<p>Not sure I'll end up going with this plan, though. I have stack of imagined "it would feel nice to <em>__</em>" experiences that guide my development. I'm trying each of them, keeping the ones that feel most simpatico. So we'll see!</p>

<p>No, the major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's <em>Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations</em>. It will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother.</p>
<p>Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

I found I didn't have my usual energy for after-hours projects, and I needed a rest this weekend.  As is usually the case in such circumstances, I spent some time cleaning up code and refactoring - I often find such activities help keep the project momentum up, while requiring less time &amp; effort.
I have spent some time recently thinking about how to manage note events and synchronize beats &amp; timing.  It seems like a good idea to integrate Ableton Link at the outset, because on some level it helps drive towards a cleaner management of such things.  It is also really nice to have a built in way for musicians to work together with a live coder; a USP perhaps.  I don't say it in the video, but the tempo of the audio is being controlled using the iPad drumming app, which the sample app and the synth are aligning with.
Another piece of ongoing work is the integration of Orca-c which I've shown previously.  This is an embedded Orca inside my text editor and forms one way in which a coder can drive the synthesizer (and later, I hope, some geometry/graphics too).  Orca isn't the only way I intend to generate music, but it represents a relatively easier integration than music languages, etc.  As I say in the video, there is still work to do to complete this feature.</p>

Essentially I have a directed graph.  Once per frame, I read the output node(s) and they try to 'compute'.  First they look at their inputs, and if any of them are 'flow data' or 'control data', they are checked to see if they are current.  If not, the graph walks further up and evaluates until the node inputs are 'current'.  Then it can be computed.  So it's very much a 'pull' architecture.
I have 3 basic types of 'pins' on my nodes.
• Flow Data.  This is like a big bundle of data arrays.  The node is expected to work on all data streams it receives in each compute step.  For music, these arrays are typically buffers of audio data; often with 1 buffer per note of polyphony.<br>• Control Data. These are also bundles of arrays, but typically contain control information, such as modulation curves.  It is just convenient for me to separate the concept of control from data.
• Parameters.  These are just data values such as float, int, etc.  They can be connected to other nodes, but they are not 'evaluated' to satisfy graph compute.  They are considered 'always valid', but that doesn't mean that the node won't walk back up the connection chain of the parameter to find the source value.
It should be considered prototype/research code, but you can see the graph Compute function here: <a href="https://github.com/cmaughan/nodegraph/blob/master/src/model/graph.cpp">https://github.com/cmaughan/nodegraph/blob/master/src/model/graph.cpp</a></p>

Summarizing: the main difference between our implementations is that in yours in each frame the whole graph gets evaluated and in mine a node gets only triggers by an event (which can be external) and this can be dependent of time but certainly not necessarily and most of the time it's user input that trigger a node or other node's triggering other nodes. Both our graphs are directed I think. Also the way the graph gets evaluated is different, in yours the pull architecture as you describe is very different then in mine , which is forward directed.
Very interesting this discussion about our approaches, I am going to think about it some more.</p>

Except to say that nodes in my graph that aren't required won't wind up getting evaluated; i.e. if they aren't part of the dependency chain of the output node, then they will not evaluate, and if a node is 'current', it doesn't need to do any work.   I don't allow loops in the network; i.e. a node will not evaluate twice per graph evaluation.  For this reason, I have a generation number on each node which can track the global generation and avoid repeat computation.  It makes the evaluation logic quite clean I think.</p>

Just documenting my struggles between wanting observable state and needing a centralised system to manage events. I tried to build my own system in a few days but soon realised there's a lot more I need to think about - and maybe there's some existing approaches you all know about that I could look into?</p>
<p>In general, am trying to update state solely via a centralised event manager, but also use observables to automatically trigger those events (if that make sense)</p>

It has three aspects that relate to your work. It is a clean sheet approach and emits to raw JS with no external dependencies such as Rect, etc.. You declare a model as a graph database schema that will be filled in with data later with data. Then you write chunks of code that draw your screen using the model data in a pure manner (the view). The controller chunks are blocks of code appended to the view drawing subroutines.  There is also the notion of a derived quantity which is lazily evaluated when it is referenced. The key advantage over your method is that if a view drawing function uses model variables, a, b and c, if any of those 3 variables change their value, then the draw chunk is re-executed. This is all tracked automatically without any the programmer having to declare dependencies, similar to how spreadsheets work, except that this is about re-executing drawing functions with memorized parameters, which is quite different than simple formulas being executed in topological order. It has a central event system called the Loom, which combines publish/subscribe, network, keyboard, mouse, timer events into one unified event stream, that is fed to the constellation of code chunks, based on their appropriateness for that event.</p>

The short story is that I've been working on a 'Live Coding' environment for some time; it is audio + visual.  Designed as a toolkit for performance, teaching, research.  So the audio is a smaller part of the whole.</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-17T16:28:27.399Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-17T16:28:27.399Z">2020-05-17 16:28:27</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Chris Maughan: </span> <p><p>When used in the audio code, the graph is running in the audio thread (same one the sound card requests a new buffer).  The generated notes from Orca/Music Language, etc. do run in a separate thread to this, but the notes are turned into PCM audio by the graph on the soundcard thread.
The UI is indeed on a separate thread.  I like lock-free programming, so as much as possible the UI is detached from the audio.  Some special nodes have 'real time' sections designed to happen in the audio thread, and 'UI' sections for display purposes.  It's up to the nodes that do this to manage shared state correctly.  This localises the problem somewhat.  An example of that might be the ADSR curve which has blue dots running along it containing note events.</p>

When the sound card requests a buffer of, say, 500 stereo samples, the graph is run.  Any notes that are due for scheduling are updated in the 'instrument' node, and then the output node 'pulls' 500 samples.  This means each node then processes 500 audio samples in its 'compute' step.  This is an atomic operation.  For example, the oscillator's compute sample might build 500 sin samples into the buffer from the wavetable.  Each node has to handle multiple channels, and doesn't know up front what it will receive.  This is the data flow part.  The LFO is no different.  Suppose it is feeding an oscillator to modulate the frequency.  The LFO data flow pin is connected to the oscillator modulation data flow pin.  At run time, the LFO will generate its 500 samples when the oscillator evaluates the modulation input, then the oscillator will generate its 500 samples and combine them with the incoming data.  If you look at the Frequency analyser in my last video, you will see the separate channels of audio.  This node simply looks at what is connected to it, and displays all the channels it finds.</p>

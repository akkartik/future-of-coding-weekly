<p>I am working on an interactive programming language named Flourish,  which aims to be programmable only in run time. The only available programming style being exploratory programming, I believe it implicitly forces TDD.  Even the concept of dependency injection is somewhat inclusive of language design.</p>

<p>Yes. It won't show the results. The highlighted portion of the stale result corresponding to a previous state  (when the condition was evaluated to false).</p>
<p>On a separate note, in the above screenshot, you cant change lines 10-11(grayed out)  as long as the condition at line 9 is false! You can only edit executing pieces of code. This design decision was taken to prevent ANY mental simulation while coding.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bold and intriguing idea - can't modify dead code - I kinda like it. I'm usually very strongly in favor of avoiding mental simulation, but even I'm not sure if this goes too far üòÇ I can see how this enforces TDD.</p>
<p>What if you call the same function twice? Which of the two values will be displayed?</p>
<p>Your mention of dependency injection reminded me of the Newspeak language - have you looked at that?</p>

<p>So I have this 4-hours trainings, pretentiously named <code>how to tell a story via web medium</code>, prepared that I run for development+marketing teams being brought together in the same room. It is at the same time attempt to introduce <code>ubiquitous language</code> (in domain-driven-design (DDD) context) for daily communication in marketing+development teams cooperation.</p>
<p>In an attempt to de-mystify some common myths of what <code>growth hackers(marketing communication specialists)</code> actually do and how <code>developers/admins/devopsers/u-name-it</code> could help them do their work better (or at least stop creating huge roadblocks, such as instroducing react&amp;friends in acquisition funnel websites, to give an example) - I would like to propose to an online webinar for FoC community those above mentioned <code>how to tell a story via web medium</code> trainings (free of charge) .</p>
<p>Please put ‚ûï if you‚Äôd be interested in joining this webinar. In case at least 4-5 people would express interest, we could start arrange‚Äôing date&amp;time in a thread, including any special topics you‚Äôd like to be addressed and included for me to prepare on top of current content.</p>

<p>Also agree that the term <code>growth hacking</code> is very commonly misused. Yet it is very successfully coined term in a sense how real world activities correlate to semantic meaning of the term, I should say. Comparably, way bigger problem is with <code>content marketing</code> term. I was once strongly considering to attend a nationwide <code>content marketing</code> conference with a speech deck named ‚Äòcan you kindly explain me which marketing communications activities are considered not content marketing?‚Äô, but decided not to be a party pooper üôÇ</p>

So, min 2 - max 3 hours. But to start with, let‚Äôs pick a date. I‚Äôm offering the week after next - kindly please which day(s) seem to suite enough to fit 2 hours in the calendar: <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r"></a><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r">https://doodle.com/poll/a9af7dewvzbpcf4r</a> .

<p>I am part of a team -- including <strong>@Daniel Krasner</strong> -- that has long been thinking about issues of personal computing, malleability, programming, and authorship. Last year we had funding for a lab and worked on a <a href="https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk">web-based authoring system we call Simpletalk</a>) (you can see <a href="https://simpletalk.systems/">a live version of it here</a>). I recently gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U6MkU5fLJw">a talk at Strange Loop</a> about the wider vision and motivations for this work, as well as a short demo of the system. You can read more detail about our motivation in <a href="https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk/blob/master/ComputingManifesto.pdf">this document</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to propose two things to the community here. The first would be a live talk / demo session, and we would like to gauge your interest in attending. Second, we will soon have test accounts for people to make their own Simpletalk stacks and worlds. If you are interested in participating, feel free to DM either of us and we will let you know when it is ready.</p>
<p>Any feedback and/or discussion is always welcome.</p>
<p>PS - Simpletalk is not a "product" and is still experimental. Use the latest versions of Firefox for the best experience.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I guess many of us agree to a large degree with your goals.</p>
<p>Two comments:</p>
<ul><li>Onions. I was surprised to learn that the layer structure was emphasized by Adele Goldberg in the context of Smalltalk, because I feel that's what it mostly missing from Smalltalk. The Smalltalk class browser displays a huge unstructured list of classes, and inside many of these classes you get a huge weakly structured list of methods. Even if a package does have layers, they are not displayed by the system.</li><li>Your reason for choosing the Web for implementing Simpletalk (in the question session) is unfortunately exactly what makes the Web ever more inevitable for everyone. Everyone who hates the Web but builds on it makes it harder to build anything else in the future. We are accumulating technical debt at a collective scale. Not that I have a better solution of course...</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-10-19T10:49:09.107Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Daniel Krasner</span> <a href="#2021-10-19T10:49:09.107Z" class="date">2021-10-19 10:49:09</a> <div class="message"><p>Thank you <a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> ! much appreciated</p>
<p>The idea of peeling back layers was always present in the Learning Research Group at PARC, but it was certainly beyond Smalltalk (whichever you take ‚Äô72 to the present). It was the emphasis that systems should not have synthetic barriers of understandability, i.e. barriers that are completely irrelevant and outside of the environment itself. Just think of how much you have to learn in order to add a button to your OS desktop to display or make so many of the even trivial changes. There is no path from A-&gt;B which does require you to learn new programming languages, paradigms, etc etc</p>
<pre><code>  It is as if to write down your thought you needed to  go and study stone carving/chiseling for 3 years‚Ä¶ This is exactly the sort of thing the LRG wanted to avoid. And I would argue that this is  the case for Smalltalk, but whether the way things are organized or the metaphor used for this organization is good, i.e. evocative, is a different conversation.

 And one we should be having! - one of the reasons to make more authorship environments! This is what Alan Kay wanted/thought was going to happen. He even insisted that they burn all the disks and start over in ~‚Äô78 but that was vetoed by the group.</code></pre><p>Smalltalk was an engine for thinking about how computing could be in the future. It was not intended to be the engine of computing. Simpletalk goes along the same direction. It is a conversation starter not an end-all. That in no way takes away from what it should be able to do - it should be the real thing.</p>
<p>Papert said that ‚Äúin order to think about thinking you need to think about thinking about something.‚Äù</p>
<p>In order to author an authorship environment you need to author the authoring of something. Awkward but you get the point‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And yes as you intuited our starting point was to build a system from the ground up. But we counted on an initial 3-6 months of funding, and going ‚Äòfrom the bare metal‚Äô to something like this with three people in that time is not realistic. Moreover we wanted to ask slightly different questions as step one, those which were beyond specificities of implementation, hardware and all that.</p>
<p>So thank you for comments! They are exactly inline with what I hope will generate the sort of thinking about such environments and computing as a whole.</p>

The problem is that there still isn't a quick way to easily make malleable, cross-platform UI without a lot of hassle. We used Ohm as our PEG because we hoped to make a Smalltalk version of the system at some point, but as you know Morphic is too heavy (and undocumented) a beast to get modern-capable UIs running.

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[October 17th, 2021 8:26 AM] ak: Ever since I learned programming I wanted to build polished apps like the ones I used to learn programming. For example, I was never satisfied with the programs I built on my BASIC interpreter because it forced me to hit Enter after pressing a key, where I could see the professional apps respond instantly to any key. I think this instinct is widespread and has basically been leading us all astray. If we just commit to never bundling apps without their development environment, never completely hiding the development environment, I think that one constraint, that commitment to a little less polish and a little more overhead, might have cascading benefits.</p>
<p>We'll have to fake it till we make it for a while, because clearly there's no market pressure to do this today. "Forgive them God, for they know not what they do."</p>

A non-programmer user will see objects like Card, Part and Window and programmer users will also see things like OrderedCollection and WebSocket for example. I can't change or repair my own car (besides the fact I don't own one), but I can use it and move stuff around with it. So I would be the non-programming user of my car. Both the programming and non-programming user would send messages to objects to request them to perform some behaviour (for which they are responsible).</p>

<p>Best way to do so was to take the ideas we like and go from there. Going into environments we knew and largely liked Smalltalk-like, Lisp-like etc would force us back into those modes of thinking/programming.</p>
<p>The idea, of course, is to throw this away and rebuild from scratch and have many authorship environments built in the world so we can better understand where this can go. With that we wanted to reach as many people as possible, from developers, to designers to current day ‚Äúusers.‚Äù Putting this in on the web has the dual advantages of being easy to distribute but also to surreptitiously undermine peoples‚Äô current perceptions of what something is.</p>

Back in the early days, each motherboard contained a little snippet of Clojure code but I noticed that a lot of them were simple if/them clauses and when they weren't you could simplify them to be so by making the other logic physical, if you know what I mean? For instance instead of writing code to detect a recent button press in the Simon game by having a Clojure variable to keep track of the last time a button was pressed, I just created a physical thingamajig that is in a certain state for a while after each button press. So if each motherboard can just be simple if/then statements with or/and/not conditions, then it can be represented by a simple graph. Even things I thought couldn't be simplified this way like a while loop turned out to be possible, the "player" circuit is a physical while loop for instance.</p>

Perfect not only to get real feedback but also try some really interesting tools from the other people here. I have to focus on work for a few weeks and trying all those tools does sound time consuming but since it's still a month away I think I probably can make it. I'll prepare a new version when I can, it's more involved than you would think, that's why the version on my site is so old, but I'll get it done.</p>

<p>I have an idea for a semi-graphical programming interface that</p>
<p>as far as I can tell is very different from anything that is currently in existence.</p>
<p>I call it:  ¬ªAnnotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)¬´</p>
<p>The core of the idea is to annotate John Trumps "Lambda Diagrams"</p>
<p>( see here: <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html"></a><a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html">https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html</a> )</p>
<p>in order to make them into a practically useful and enjoyable programming user interface. (Hopefully even live coding capable).</p>
<p>Don't be tricked into grouping this together with node editors.</p>
<p>While there are visual line and box elements, this is definitely not a node editor.</p>
<p>That is because there simply are no nodes here.</p>
<p>What may look like nodes are merely redundant tags/annotations of the lines.</p>
<p>As such there is no need to decide</p>
<p>‚Äî which one of wires and nodes represents values and</p>
<p>‚Äî which one represents value-transforming-functions</p>
<p>So these ALDs are also not to confuse with what could be called "inverse node editors" where the roles of lines and nodes are swapped from the usual association. Also note that having functions being first class values does not remove this issue of node editors ‚Ä¶ as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Here is a writeup of the basic idea:</p>

<p>But implementing this even more so.</p>
<p>I did not get very far in my first attempt. To put it mildly.</p>
<p>I didn't even get to implementing the actual diagrams ‚Ä¶</p>

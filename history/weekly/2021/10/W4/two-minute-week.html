It's now possible to drag directly connected nodes by dragging a connection/wire. Offcourse it's in preparation to be able to have special controls to drag all connected nodes or nodes that are connected upstream or downstream. yeah , I was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion">Ivan Reese</a> "rant" on a lot of vpl's (mine included), although I thought it was just very inspirational offcourse and will work on improving my editor hopefully on time for our review session somewhere on November. For now I just have a lot of work todo, and having limited time, that's quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Another feature that I already implemented some time ago is the "mini-excel"-datagrid which can have expressions and even in attached expression-nodes you can run expressions on the cells.</p>
<p>I am also working on removing a node from the canvas and leaving the connected arrows on the canvas, but that needs some more work.</p>

Although currently you need to hold shift while dragging and depending if the mouse cursor is on the left or right half of the node, the downstream or upstream dragging is triggered. In the near future I'll implement special controls. I'll try to find time to update the video to showcase itðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜€</p>

Also deleting nodes and keeping the wires can be seen in action. When dragging new nodes to the canvas, they can auto-connect using these floating wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/pg6pAcEzi8E"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/pg6pAcEzi8E">https://youtu.be/pg6pAcEzi8E</a></p>

I hope to make an even bigger improvement later this year when I'll remove the konva library (which uses canvas) and replace it with svg's. Moving to rust/webassembly and webgl is on my wishlist, but currently I don't have the time for that unfortunately</p>

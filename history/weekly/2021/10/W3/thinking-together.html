<p>First, presume we're using Haskell-style syntax, so that <code>f(2,3)</code> (C-style) is written as <code>f 2 3</code> (Haskell-style). Second, presume that parameters (in function signatures) must be prefixed with a <code>&amp;</code> symbol (or whatever symbol you prefer; we'll need this later), so the definition of <code>f</code> would look something like <code>f &amp;x &amp;y = ...</code>. Now, imagine the definer of the function can choose where the function name is supposed to appear. So we could define the function f in several ways:</p>
<ul><li><code>f &amp;x &amp;y =</code> , in which case a function call would look like <code>f 2 3</code></li><li><code>&amp;x f &amp;y =</code> , in which case a function call would look like <code>2 f 3</code></li><li><code>&amp;x &amp;y f =</code>, in which case a function call would look like <code>2 3 f</code></li></ul><p>Why would we want a syntax like this? Many reasons.</p>
<ul><li>We get infix operators for free:</li></ul><ul><li><code>&amp;x + &amp;y =</code></li><li><code>&amp;x mod &amp;y =</code></li></ul><ol start="2"><li>We can have multi-word function names:</li></ol><ul><li><code>&amp;x is less than &amp;y =</code></li><li><code>if &amp;cond then &amp;a else &amp;b =</code></li></ul><ol start="3"><li>This syntax erases the distinction between defining three separate functions returning one value each, and defining one function returning a record with three fields. I think this is nice; the distinction seemed arbitrary in the first place! Reducing the number of superficial choices a programmer needs to make helps reduce the cognitive burden of programming.</li></ol><p>And probably more things üôÇ.</p>
<p>What are the downsides of this syntax?</p>
<ul><li>Some of the "classic" syntax of programming languages now becomes ambiguous. In particular, we hit ambiguities when passing functions around as values. In Haskell you can write expressions like <code>map f list</code> where f is a function being passed as an argument. Given we could now define <code>f</code> as an infix or postfix function (see earlier), we need to make sure that we can refer to the function in an unambiguous manner. We could do this by writing something like <code>map (. f .) list</code> where the <code>.</code> symbol means an unbound parameter. For the multi-word functions, you'd write <code>map (. is less than 5) list</code></li><li>There are a few other potential issues I'm working out.</li></ul><p>Regardless, this seems like an interesting idea, right? üôÇ How do people feel about it?</p>

<p>There should be some rules for how and when names/words can be re-used. The simplest is probably that if a word appears in a function name, then it can't also be the full name of a variable (nullary function).</p>
<p>Assuming <code>fun1</code> and <code>fun2</code> aren't pre-defined variables, your example doesn't violate the aforementioned rule. However, that call would match nothing, so you'd get a compile time error.</p>

<p>That depends on your keyboard layout. On mine (AZERTY, French), it is the parenthesis that don't need extra key and both curly and square brackets require "Atl-Gr" key. Which is annoying when you code and that's why some French devs prefer using a qwerty keyboard (so without "√©√†√®..." keys).</p>

There are no function calls, only rewrite rules, so it's no problem to make the equivalent of function-call syntax function-specific.</p>
<p>For the parenthesis issue, I adopted a feature from the Pyret language (<a href="https://www.pyret.org/index.html"></a><a href="https://www.pyret.org/index.html">https://www.pyret.org/index.html</a>): it requires parenthesis around any operator/function call, the one exception being chained use of the same operator.

<p>I've always been convinced of the need to reduce the syntax needed in formal end-user languages, and decoupling parameters from their exact position is a basic tool for that; passing parameters by name instead of position was an improvement in post-C languages, so it's easy to imagine what benefits that style can bring.</p>
<p>I'll go deeper into heresy: in a visual environment (think e.g. a spreadsheet or graphical design tool), you don't even need the function name to be adjacent to the parameters; the environment itself can suggest the list of nearby locally available values that are compatible with the function's input types, and the user chooses which one is appropriate. Applying functions becomes a point&amp;click interaction rather than recalling which syntax I need.</p>
<p>This can even depend on named parameters. Think of an IDE where, when you're passing a parameter to a function, "intellisense" suggests all nearby variables in scope with the right type that could be used for that parameter. Conversely, you could select a value and type a parameter name over it, and it could suggest function names that use that type of the value with that parameter name as a role for the value, so that the user to choose the most adequate suggested function. How many less API reference queries would it take for the user of this system?</p>
<p>In this style of coding, the structure of connections is more important than the concrete syntax of the text you create them with. In my opinion visual languages are the ones that can benefit the most from this separation between structure and placement, as perfect placement of values w.r.t. functions in a graphical environment is more difficult than with raw text.</p>

Synthetic languages do a lot of agglunitation and morphology, for example they have cases like accusative or locative and lots of agreement. Analytic languages don't bother much with aggrement and morphology (which is also why NLP on English always starts off so easily). But that comes with a price: English has a relatively fixed word order, whereas in Russian you can basically order the words in your sentence almost any way you like.</p>
<p>So from that we learn that in order to avoid ambiguity, if we could tag the tokens in our programming language with a 'case', we could get away with much more free token order in each statement.</p>

If I had to guess, you're thinking of each symbol in the sequence <code>(a b c)</code> as a value. In contrast, I was thinking of each symbol as a "piece of syntax" that helps identify which function to call.</p>
<p>Under your interpretation, <code>(fun1 fun2 var3)</code> is ambiguous, because it could be interpreted as passing the symbolic value "fun2" to the fun1 function, or as passing the symbolic value "fun1" to the fun2 function.</p>
<p>Under my interpretation, there is no function definition with the signature <code>(fun1 fun2 .)</code>, so you get a compile-time error.</p>
<p>But since starting this thread, I've actually been trending towards the first interpretation. It might turn out to be "nicer" in practice, especially as an alternative to passing strings around everywhere. But I think you'd now want/need variable references to be distinguished from symbols, using the <code>&amp;</code> syntax as you mentioned, or even just the parentheses (after all, a variable reference is just a function call with zero arguments). So a function call would look like <code>fun1 (a) (b)</code> or <code>fun1 &amp;a &amp;b</code>. Though I've been thinking about a more lightweight syntax inspired by Rust's lifetime syntax: <code>fun1 'a 'b</code>. It's probably necessary to avoid parentheses/syntax hell.</p>

We called it "anyfix"/"omnifix". It's fun to see these other implementations with names like Interfix and Mixfix!</p>
<p>The use case for us was talking to medical care providers and discovering that many would invent their own written shorthands (grammars) for jotting down EMR data while working with patients, which would often have out-of-order parameters (20 inches 10lbs or 10lbs 20 inches etc). IIRC ambiguity was the exception rather than the rule. We figured if it's very clear to humans what the intent is the parser should be able to figure it out too.</p>
<p>It was rather easy to implement in Tree Notation, which is a whitespace based syntax where each row is a node split into cells. The line parser first determines what kind of node the line is, and then a cell parser determines what the type of each cell is. A node definition states the cell types expected and whether to use a prefix/postfix/omnifix parser. Simple tests (such as regex) are then used to detect the type of each word in the omnifix case.</p>
<p>In theory this puts the onus of avoiding ambiguity on the language designer, but in practice (IIRC from our small experiments) it was surprisingly easy to avoid. It seemed that usually when you have 2 params with the same type, it was often better to take a list instead.</p>

A main featured distinguishing term rewriting from traditional function-calling approaches is precisely the separation of syntax and evaluation. Term rewriting systems start from a term algebra, which just says what valid terms look like. The next layer adds patterns and pattern matching, the result of which is a substitution. With patterns you can define rules. Rewriting is yet another layer, in which you have to decide on a strategy to select and apply rules. If you want different operational semantics, you just change the last one or two layers, but you can keep the lower ones.</p>
<p>In contrast, with traditional PL design, there is no useful layer between the AST and the full language, evaluation semantics included.</p>

<p>Looking at 3D softwares like Maya, or VS Code's right panel icons; I sometimes have a hard time understanding why we've come to rely on icons so much when they're almost never readable without an extra effort of hovering on them or clicking on them to know more about them.</p>
<p>Photoshop is the guiltiest of all in this category, and you also have softwares like Figma, where all possible operations tend to be grouped under just a few icons, and clicking on those icons opens a dropdown that contains icon + description, which makes everything really easy to understand.</p>
<p>Could there be some reasonable explanation beyond lack of space?</p>
<p>In contrast, Windows Explorer took a different approach, where it occupies more space, but every single option is cristal clear even for the most untrained eye.</p>

<p>Of course, using only icons can be okay in some cases: The longer one uses a tool and the more familiar one becomes with a tool, it might make sense to hide labels for less noise and more space. macOS toolbars provide users the option to choose between ‚Äútext and icons‚Äù, ‚Äúicons only‚Äù, ‚Äútext only‚Äù. </p>

<p>It all comes down to learned familiarity.</p>
<p>If you think about signs (pictograms) at an airport or train station, they are not only large in size but also represent the real world (planes, food, bath room, people, ‚Ä¶) which makes it easier to understand those pictures.</p>
<p>But icons in software often need to represent abstract or novel features that don‚Äôt have a real world metaphor. And worse: they are often displayed in small size and too many of them nearby.</p>
<p>Another example that comes to my mind are traffic signs that may not come with labels but which need to be learned in driving school. Traffic signs come with color coding which can certainly help to convey additional meaning.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdnanChaumette">Adnan Chaumette</a> The toolbar on the right side of Pixelmator shows icons only, but once you hover over an icon, labels for all other icons are shown as well. <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1218"></a><a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1218">https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1218</a></p>

<p>People say similar things about game development. How come it used to be that a single 15yo could write a world class game, now it needs a team of 100 professionals? Well, the definition of "world class game" moved a long way.</p>

<p>I guess I agree with Chris Knott, but would phrase it differently: A lot of the change is that people's expectations have gone up as we've seen what's possible.</p>

<p>[my reaction to the above statement]</p>
<h1>Definition of Simplicity</h1><p>‚ÄúLack of Nuance‚Äù</p>
<h1>Source of Complexity</h1><p>Problems have a number of degrees of freedom - dimensions.</p>
<p>Our reality appears to have 4 dimensions (4D) - x,y,z,t.</p>
<p>Trying to squeeze more than one dimension into a single notation results in what we perceive as complexity.</p>
<p>Flattening 4D (reality) down to 2D (pen and paper) results in ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù - some things become merely harder to express. We need more than one 2D notation to express 4D concepts, each in a seemingly ‚Äúsimple‚Äù way.</p>
<h1>Complexity Is In The Eye Of The Beholder</h1><p>Nothing is ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù.</p>
<p>The use of a mis-fitting notation might make a problem appear more complex, but does not change the underlying nature of the problem.</p>

It's also equally clear that times of increasing complexity provide lots of cover for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">capture</a> and rentierism. Such times are when priest classes gain power. If the "complexity inequality" grows too large in society it can become irreversible. The time for an intervention is when the priest class is still small and relatively ineffective. It's questionable if the programmer priest class is small these days, but it seems clear that it's ineffective. Society is constantly reminded these days of its failures. So these debates seem very valuable.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ChrisKnott">Chris Knott</a> You're right that the space of possible quality has expanded a lot. An additional part of the problem is that the supported part of the space is a tiny fraction of the total space. Someone learning how to build websites today is unlikely to encounter pure-html tutorials anymore (that are not references). There's a pervasive implicit assumption in tutorials that the end point is CNN's website, which requires lots of ongoing maintenance in exchange for its perceived quality. I think it's valuable to expose people early to the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a> in software.</p>

<p>For someone familiar with Web technology, the answer is no, as others have pointed out: if you want a plain HTML site, you can still make one with exactly the same effort as in 1996.</p>
<p>For someone familiar with just browsing the Web, who then wants to move on to creating a Web site, the answer is yes: it's much harder to get started because of the enormous labyrinth of paths you need to evaluate to make a good choice. Most of them end in some non-obvious trap such as a walled garden.</p>
<p>In 1996, you could walk into a book store, buy "Web sites for Dummies", and get going. Maybe some other book would give slightly better advice, but you couldn't make a serious mistake following any book's advice. Today, there is no obvious place to look for guidance, and most advertised solutions can be a serious mistake, depending on your requirements.</p>

<p>Here's a sketch for an MVP that provides this experience in the bluntest, most obvious way possible:</p>
<ul><li>Download a framework packaged as a single file, including all necessary dependencies. You download it from an https URL, and that's it, you're good to go.</li><li>It only supports *nix platforms on desktop machines. Linux, BSD, maybe Windows Subsystem for Linux. Macs are explicitly out because they're basically not an open platform anymore[1]. And we're going to need an open platform for the sorts of stuff we're planning below.</li><li>You can install arbitrary apps from arbitrary sources that run atop the framework. The apps are in interpreted languages and always come with source code.</li><li>When you run an app, it always opens on the app first. This is important. There's no REPL or IDE front and center. The interaction modes are whatever the app chooses.</li><li>When you run an app, the framework always shows the privileges it has in some consistent part of the screen. The vocabulary and enforcement of those privileges is the major responsibility of the framework. Needing it to be always visible is why you need a desktop machine with a large screen.</li><li>The app can ask for privileges, but the framework gives you the ability to lie to the app. Here's a simulated network environment that looks offline or has these honeypots. Here's a simulated file system with almost nothing or a few honeypot files. (Inspired by the Arcan project: <a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6"></a><a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6">https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6</a>)</li><li>While running any app, the framework always provides a consistent set of primitives for interacting with the interpreted sources for that app. Imagine a button in the corner that flips a Hypercard over to open an editor on its sources, or something like that. Once you're in the editor you can modify it, run it, get syntax errors, test failures, etc. The editor and build environment themselves are implemented in the framework; for the MVP we'll assume we don't need to support modifying the framework.</li></ul><p>I wonder how far Glamorous Toolkit is from this sort of experience, <a href="https://twitter.com/girba">Tudor Girba</a> <a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a>. On one hand it massively over-delivers on the editing framework. The sandboxing stuff is a new frontier with lots of open-ended questions on the best experience to avoid confusing people before they understand how things work.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking about building on something less ambitious for an MVP, like libSDL atop femtolisp or LuaJIT. Maybe also JavaScript üò¨</p>
<p>[1] Like, it's great Apple that you eliminated vectors for malicious apps with all the restrictions on installing software. But I already had a perfectly good and healthy and functional relationship with the folks who provide gdb. When you prevent me from installing gdb, that's not cool. It's good to want to protect people from dysfunctional relationships. But to require all relationships to go through a single point is not. /rant</p>

<p>The Android development environment is a thought-provoking answer as well. .apk is a single file. Can you run it just by passing it to the Android environment? Even if it opens in the IDE, hitting one keystroke to get to the simulator doesn't seem such a big deal. Seems akin to the Borland tools from the '90s which were pretty nice.</p>
<p>Which has me wondering what other requirements I need to add üòõ I think a key piece is: the only way to run the app is from within the development framework. It's impossible to run in isolation.</p>
<p>Zooming out to a whole computer is a way to trivially satisfy these criteria. Hence my attempt to start out focused on a single app that the end-user is using.</p>

For example, I was never satisfied with the programs I built on my BASIC interpreter because it forced me to hit Enter after pressing a key, where I could see the professional apps respond instantly to any key. I think this instinct is widespread and has basically been leading us all astray. If we just commit to never bundling apps without their development environment, never completely hiding the development environment, I think that one constraint, that commitment to a little less polish and a little more overhead, might have cascading benefits.</p>
<p>We'll have to fake it till we make it for a while, because clearly there's no market pressure to do this today. "Forgive them God, for they know not what they do."</p>

<p>I think one aspect might be that they are seen as "a TikTok" rather than "an edited video". In this paradigm it might be seen as inauthentic to edit it outside the app on a Hollywood editing desk, then somehow upload it. Kind of like writing a compiler that targeted minified PICO-8 - it would be seen as dishonest.</p>

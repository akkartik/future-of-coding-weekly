Also, if you're designing for readability, the body copy should average between 12-14 words wide on each line. Wikipedia's default style sheet has long violated this latter norm, which makes it more difficult to read articles without an alternate stylesheet.</p>

I'm privileged to keep my windows wide enough that it doesn't go flush with the left margin.</p>
<p>As an experiment I just reduced the width of my website. In the past I found pages like <a href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html"></a><a href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">http://paulgraham.com/essay.html</a> too narrow, but now my site is the same width, and neither seems off. I'll keep this for a while and see how it feels.</p>

<p>One aspect I find missing is that trust depends on everyone's personal context, and in particular on personal knowledge and competence, plus available resources. That's particularly true for proofs, which generate trust only for people who  understand them. For everyone else, including many domain experts who have other things to do with their life, it's back to trusting experts and other authorities.</p>
<p>Another aspect of trust that is missing is a legal framework (liability etc.). It's historically very weak for software, making it low-risk to do harm to others, knowingly or accidentally.</p>
<p>An aspect that you hint at but don't develop in detail is collective rather than individual trust, i.e. reputation.</p>
<p>For mature technologies, all sources of trust come together into what is more a web of trust than a trust chain. I use my Bosch power drill with little hesitation because (1) I trust the brand because of its reputation, (2) it's a widely used tool resulting from a long history of development, so its potential risks are well known, (3) consumer protection laws are pretty strong for such equipment.</p>

At this point it occurred to me that programming languages go through inordinate amounts of syntactic differentiation to distinguish between different tokens in a programming language. This leads to escaping mechanisms within strings, and also notions of operator precedence in the case of APL like languages. Most of this is a result of tools -- early versions of editors were not structural.</p>
<p>Has anyone thought of/looked at examples of what programming would be like if one added a secondary layer of say range based annotations on top of strings (basically a rich text like notation) that would make it much easier to parse/disambiguate tokens and semantics?  The only thing that springs to mind is Chuch Moore's colorForth.</p>

Got to love levels of escaping!  I swear I once had the string <code>"\\\\\\"</code>.  On the balance the best solution is to have different kinds of escapes for the same sort of thing so as to avoid interference.  You don't need to be Perl/Ruby crazy about it either.  Lua's long string syntax is great <code>[[No problem with "quotes" here.]]</code> because <code>[[because [[this]] kind nests without trouble]]</code> and in case of real nonsense you can use extra special equal sign brackets: <code>[===[With some opens ([[) some closes (]]) and whatever else ]==] except the following does end it: ]===]</code>.  Use as many equal signs as makes you comfortable.</p>

<p>It's not just a result of tools. All formal notations of the pre-computing age (think mathematics) were designed, by necessity, to be parsed visually by human readers, without the help of any tools. Operator precedence, for example, clearly goes back to that era.</p>

<p>Most PLs' user interface (what a programmer has access to) is the 1D text representation. Lisps also give access to the AST level. Forth and friends give access to an ASL level (L = list rather than T = tree). Spreadsheets are 2D only. There is a lot of space for experimentation, which I why I like your tree notation experiments, though I am pretty sure I haven't grasped its potential yet.</p>

<p>The two traps to avoid there are (1) accessibility issues (Daltonians etc.) and (2) changing user expectations. Syntax highlighting in text editors has created the expectation that text attributes have no semantics.</p>

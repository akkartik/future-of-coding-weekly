We're looking for early alpha users if anyone is interested (<a href="https://gadget.dev/">drop your email on the site</a> or DM me).</p>
<p>Problem: Web development is slower and more expensive than it should be, because of the endless, repetitive boilerplate/glue code that developers have to manouver.</p>
<p>Challenge: Build a platform that gives developers a set of higher level building blocks, while providing them with the ability to drop down to a lower level when the abstractions don't work.</p>
<p>Solution: Gadget, a preconfigured, bundled development platform (IDE +++) that gives you a set of components with sane defaults that you can override, in code,  designed to meet the needs of modern web application developers.</p>
<p>Basically, Gadget is our vision of what "low code for devs" should actually feel like (for web app development). An experience where the computer is responsible for all the annoying busywork the developer doesn't want to do,  while leaving the engineer to make all the engineering decisions.</p>
<p>Here's a not-so-short video (20 min) where I build, deploy and test a declarative API for the backend of a Kanban board:</p>

The only bit of (superficial, sorry) feedback I've got at this point is that.. I'm not really able to understand what Gadget is, or what it's for, just by looking at the home page.</p>
<ul><li>I get that it's for building apps —&nbsp;but what kind of apps? Web apps? iOS apps? It'd be helpful to see an example (screenshot, or little video, or whatever) of an app built with Gadget.</li><li>The video shows me a few teases of Gadget UI, plus a huge comment block (which looks an awful lot like a boilerplate :/ )... but it doesn't give me a sense of what is actually happening. There's a brief second where I can see the sidebar on the left, which seems like it might help me understand the hierarchy of Gadget.. but it goes by too quickly to comprehend. (Products? Product variants? Is this Gadget itself, or something built with Gadget?)</li></ul><p>I'm sure the home page is not final. It's just hard for me to know if I could be an early alpha user just by looking at it (even taken together with the helpful problem / challenge / solution description you've posted here).</p>

<p>So it might be tough to find people to kick the tires on this. Hopefully you've got a community of folks somewhere who actually want to, you know, build some apps. They'll probably have much better feedback than the meta-level stuff you'll get here.</p>

<p>Is the primary goal to support some existing language or platform as-is? Or will the language coevolve with the tooling?</p>

We'll bring up a new language along with it, but it will just be one possible language for the format. We hope in time that better language designers than us will find the format compelling and build their own languages.</p>
<p>We don't think we'll bother tying to existing languages except in a "foreign function call" kind of way.</p>

I'm also thinking about these exact same problems, but I'm not sure I agree with the solution. Most of the problems you demonstrate in the start of the Handmade Seattle video aren't really problems with the file format, they're problems with the editor interface.</p>
<p>If you've written an editor to prevent certain classes of errors, you can still write the output of that editor to a textual format. As long as you don't modify that file with other tools, all of your invariants still hold.</p>
<p>Once you're thinking in this projectional way, you could, for instance, save to a text format that is simplified (removing braces/other syntax). But I don't see a strong reason to change the underlying format itself. Moving to a binary (or a 'new text') format just sounds like it would obfuscate the actual data, and require an entirely new toolchain to read and manipulate.</p>
<p>That said, I'm all for that goal if you're fine with it taking many years. 🙂 But it's not just about programming -- it would need to consider all of computing, in some sort of holistic way. It'd be interesting to explore a text-like format with just slightly more structure, but I'm not really sure what that would look like.</p>

The editor you presented in the video didn't seem to take advantage of that (or at least not in the first few minutes. 🙂)</p>
<p>It'd be cool to see more use cases, though, as I can't immediately think of a reason to have overlapping parenthesis, other than maybe succinctness of variable definition. Moving off text requires reimplementing every tool in the workflow, so you have to find a justification for that cost.</p>

<ul><li>Plain text as a storage encoding: In theory anything can be encoded as text (worst case you just base64 encode it) but I don't think it is useful to call such an object "plain text".</li><li>Plain text as a UI: This is what I think we often mean when saying something is "just text". The UI consists of lines of characters. Often there are symbols and whitespace as special markers. Words and literals often mean something useful in the subject domain. We navigate this space with the cursor and probably many editor shortcuts.</li><li>Plain text diffs: This is an idea within text-as-UI. When comparing two objects, we compare the plain text representations. This means all encoding artifacts are diffed, whether useful or not (whitespace, order of lines, ...)</li></ul><p>I agree that you can always store stuff in plain text - even if you want to represent a graph with nodes, metadata, and links, you could figure out a JSON or XML encoding for it. However, if we're giving up #2 above, because all editing will be done via special projectional editors, how much value do we get in preserving #1? Sure you could check it into git and view the line-by-line diffs, but they would be meaningless, no? With some work the plain text encoding could be carefully crafted so the diffs are somewhat meaningful, but I feel this is a losing battle. Richer projections cannot be displayed by line diffing tools. Objects in the text file cannot be given identity (note many clever hacks such as patience-diff, that try and localize linear diffs to the correct function definition). So in the end the line diff might end up being less and less useful, perhaps even hold us back from implementing richer projections ("oh that will ruin the line diff")?</p>

Diffs are a clear example a general issue. If you encode something to text, you also have to decide if you want the encoded text to be useful in some way that a binary file would not be. If you do choose that, we think you're prone to importing constraints from "text land" into whatever it is you're building. If you want to get away from the constraints imposed by text, you also give up corresponding aspects of text that make it convenient - they seem to go together.</p>

Both are experimental programming environments with their own bespoke languages, focussed on learnability and visualization. In the case of Code Lauren, we also see another theme of Mary's work — taking the largely invisible processing done by compilers / interpreters and making it visible and interactive. Mary also made a totally awful game that I hate so much, but to find out what that is you'll just have to listen to the show (or read the largely unedited transcript — again, sorry Jack).</p>

One of them was so much in collision with my own ideas for the future of coding that I am tempted to launch a discussion on it. It's the notion of an "escape hatch" from a programming environment.</p>
<p>Overall, there's too much of a "let's build a universe" attitude in computing, and the idea of a programming environment ideally being complete and mostly closed is a reflection of it. I don't want  an escape hatch for going elsewhere if I absolutely have to. I want bridges to other programming environments, for my own use and for connecting with other people's work.</p>
<p>My idea of the future of coding is more like living in physical space. I live in a house, which has multiple rooms. In some rooms, I do things alone, in others with family members. The house is part of a neighborhood, where I do things with neighbours. The neighborhood is part of a town, and so on. Each compartment provides just the right environment for some activity, but none locks me in, wishing for an escape hatch.</p>

<p>Today, the guest is &lt;<a href="https://maryrosecook.com|Mary">https://maryrosecook.com|Mary</a> Rose Cook&gt;, among whose thousand-and-one side projects you'll find <a href="http://islalanguage.org|Isla">http://islalanguage.org|Isla</a> and &lt;<a href="http://codelauren.com|Code">http://codelauren.com|Code</a> Lauren&gt;. Both are experimental programming environments with their own bespoke languages, focussed on learnability and visualization. In the case of Code Lauren, we also see another theme of Mary's work — taking the largely invisible processing done by compilers / interpreters and making it visible and interactive. Mary also made a totally awful game that I hate so much, but to find out what that is you'll just have to listen to the show (or read the largely unedited transcript — again, sorry Jack).</p>

Or do you want some set of independent universes to choose "standards for interoperability"? I think we have the second already, and to the extent it fails it's because of the first problem. So let's talk about the first problem.</p>
<p>Building a passage/wormhole between two rooms/universes is hard. Even for the programmers who built this one room you're in now. Nobody wants to make it easier, because that's even harder. Nobody wants it enough to put in the work, because everybody grew up living in a single room just like you. So it won't happen until somebody somewhere starts building it into software they didn't write, without asking for permission. We have to make it scalable to hack on unfamiliar codebases in incompatible ways.</p>

Stop talking about escape hatches, start talking about bridges.</p>
<p>Yes, interoperability is hard, even more so if you want to retrofit it. So let's start with new environments, which is what many us in this space are working on or dreaming of.</p>
<p>It's actually happening. A nice example: <a href="https://github.com/JuliaInterop"></a><a href="https://github.com/JuliaInterop">https://github.com/JuliaInterop</a>. What I want is more of that. More effort for making systems interoperable.</p>

<p>Did you mean new environments interoperating with existing ones? That still has scaling issues if you care about multiple existing ones.</p>
<p>New environments interoperating with other new ones = hard yes! If anyone cares.</p>

As in the case of Julia. And yes, this has scaling issues. But if it leads to competitive advantages ("I picked Julia because it has all those nice bridges to other languages"), it can lead to the change of attitude that is needed.</p>
<p>All-to-all bridging without scaling issues requires infrastructure support, and then adoption of that infrastructure. The only attempt I am aware of is Oracle's GraalVM/Truffle combo. Which requires re-implementing all languages, but apparently makes this relatively straightforward for JVM languages.</p>

<p>If it were (on the order of) adding wires from module / language A to B, we'd see an explosion of software reuse. It should not matter what language some useful bit of code is written in, but unfortunately today, language boundaries create high walls.</p>

<p>I consider a tool for thought something that literally helps us think. Not attempting to do the thinking for us, or automate away thinking, but augmenting and enhancing our capabilities to understand, ideate, and explore. We stay in control, and our cognitive abilities are amplified.</p>
<p>After all, people who use tools like Roam Research are “just” modeling certain parts of their individual thinking process and the tool gives them an environment to structure their thoughts in, which is remarkably similar to designing a data model, except that it requires much more flexibility and dynamism than what we computer people think of when we talk about a “data model”.</p>
<p>From that perspective the overlap is huge. I do acknowledge, however, that this is just a narrow definition of both tools for thought and the future of programming, and there are plenty of other areas to explore in both.</p>

<p>So one can dream of a programming environment that provides tools for the "thinking" of the programming artifacts that are being created, and the way the thoughts are recorded/shown to be deeply connected to the actual programming artifacts.</p>
<p>I mean, when we start a new relatively complex project, we often start by discussing and thinking by drawing sketches on a whiteboard. Then we move to our computer writing code to bring the architecture/design to life. But the connection between the "thoughts artifacts" and the system is lost. Why not having tools that help us keep the too connected?</p>

Seems a little more broadly spread out between different app communities like Roam etc.</p>
<p>The overlap is as pointed out substantial, but the approach of either side look like they start from different philosophies. Projects that show up in Future of Coding seem to emphasize tangible experimentation with the process of engineering, often from a bottom-up approach (i.e. what are the small composable pieces and the processes that construct them). On the other hand, Zettelkasten systems and other such approaches are more top-down, in the style of trying to understand or create a specification, and in general maneuvering in graph-like space of ideas rather than lower-level processes with causal chains.</p>
<p>Meeting in the middle is the natural next step, but I wonder where the emphasis should be placed. Are we missing an interface between thought and implementation, due to the tremendous difficulty of translation as pointed out by many already? Are the two sides not melded enough, or instead are they not well-separated enough? Is there a missing calculus of thought somewhere floating in this space? Would love to explore these areas with anyone interested, or hear about any other interesting endeavors along these lines.</p>

<p>But seriously, I agree the intersection is very large. To me, they're both fundamentally about representing (and manipulating) ideas in digital form. I've been thinking about them as different aspects of the same problem for a while now.</p>

Reverse execution is one way to go back, which suffers from having too much detail usually.  So it's good to take the, usually incorrect, "how can is this even possible" value and just follow its data-flow but with surrounding context because (1) you're probably looking for a control flow branch not taken and (2) the data-flow tree itself is liable to be extra bushy yet easily pruned.  In contrast, stepping forward has the problem that a lot of initialization/configuration happens, especially in framework code, which is noisy and mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p>And for pure reverse execution, the trick is to automatically lift functions so that they pass whatever data is necessary to run in reverse in a hidden channel.  In general <code>f' x = (f x, x)</code> works, but sometimes you can use shortcuts.  But then you might as well use checkpoints like most people do.  And the <code>f'</code> above isn't so useful since it's referentially transparent and the whole point is that you want to look inside <code>f</code>.</p>

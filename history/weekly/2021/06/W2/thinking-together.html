<p>I had some thoughts on synchronization of data, which I realize is an aspect of Hest's design space that's not fully explored, so grain of salt and all that 🙂</p>
<p>Mostly I want to draw a parallel to chip design (VHDL/Verilog), which if you squint a bit is a lot like Hest but with much, much worse UX. You run into the same synchronization problems there, and the solution is actually really close to both the "sync" primitive and the "Fibers" you describe in your podcast – you put latches/registers between components of your design.</p>
<p>In fact, those are a nice implicit way that abstraction and structure can arise in a hardware design – when you realize you can't do all the things you want to instantaneously, you add a latch, which then delineates a component/pipeline stage.</p>
<p>One point (in my eyes) in favor of calling it a "barrier" rather than the concept of "Fibers" is that with Fibers, you're essentially making the bug undetectable. Consider a -thing- with two inputs, but one of them does not arrive.</p>
<p>If your inputs are combined at a barrier, your code would get stuck if either input didn't arrive in time, and the program might grind to a halt.</p>
<p>But with Fibers, presumably one of your inputs just wouldn't change and you'd have stale data on that input, but not the other. That's a recipe for producing garbage outputs and never noticing until fifteen functions later (see also: ROS 🙄 – or any pub-sub system, really).</p>

<p>(As an aside — the relation to chip design is choice. I work for a company that studies hydraulic &amp; electrical systems, so there's a ton of "I read schematics" DNA going into Hest. Not quite the same domain, but adjacent.)</p>
<blockquote><p>But with Fibers, presumably one of your inputs just wouldn't change and you'd have stale data on that input, but not the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My initial thought is that this is probably fine. As in: it's not as good as not hitting this bug, granted, but it's a bug that should be easy to avoid most of the time and easy to solve when it does come up. If you hit this bug, then when you notice it 15 functions later, you just rewind execution back until you see where the problem cropped up.</p>
<p>That was my initial thought. But my prevailing thought is... that I don't understand what you mean by this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One point (in my eyes) in favor of calling it a "barrier" rather than the concept of "Fibers"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is a barrier like the "sync" node in SpaceChem? Is it something else?</p>
<p>I'd like to hear more about what you think I should do instead of fibers. I think you're onto something (*), but I don't understand it well enough, even after a day of reflecting on it.</p>
<p>(* Fibers are a conflation of several things. They hold state, they help with coordination. There are a few other approaches I've considered that keep those things separate. So it's very likely that I'll find more ways to slice up these concepts by looking at how other domains, like chips, handle similar problems.)</p>

I'm not sure that I'd want this to be part of the core language model, but I'd like to be able to build abstractions that can do this out of whatever the core model allows.</p>
<p>In the current prototypes, yes, you can attach multiple edges to a node. I wrote a blog post about how that makes the time-rewinding behaviour a little thorny: <a href="http://ivanish.ca/hest-time-travel">ivanish.ca/hest-time-travel</a></p>

<p>Right now, if you have two lines that come in to a single point (function), then that function will be invoked whenever any data arrives at it. Up until now, I've been regarding this as.. akin to having a function that is called from more than one place. Each incoming edge represents a different caller of the function. But this doesn't offer a nice way to build systems that need to call a function with more than one argument. So that's what I'm trying to.. figure out.</p>

<p>Looks like you're allowing the "function points" (like <code>*=</code>) to have internal state too, which makes rewinding manually-inserted points even more tricky. </p>
<p>It's a fascinating design space, and my initial instinct is to go very functional on it, but that would perhaps make the entire system less accessible (I've struggled with a similar tradeoff at work, actually)</p>

I think it'd be much easier to design this if there was no state beyond the moving data points. But I think there are a lot of playful things I can do if state is allowed to go anywhere, even if it makes things harder to reason about, harder to design, harder to implement.</p>
<p>If it turns out to be just too difficult to work with, I can always simplify by removing state.</p>

<p>“So. Business intelligence tools are arguably the “original” and most advanced form of no-code / low-code application. Clearly an interactive dashboard built in your favorite BI tool is a fairly complex no-code, specialized data app. Now here’s the question: why has low-code been so prevalent in data visualization historically while being not popular in other areas of software development? What is it that makes low-code more suited to dataviz?”</p>

<p>Also it may be because the scope of dataviz is much smaller than "programming", so specialized tools can be created for the domain.</p>

It's meant to be visited in your daylight reveries. It will exist in the real world when those city types and them country folks finally make nice.</p>
<p>Or as Trudy Campbell once put it, "Oh, Peter, don't go to the well—there's no water there."</p>

<p>As I was working on an exploration on debugging interfaces, I came across the concept of using music controls for code execution (just for fun). What buttons would you expect to be there, and what would you expect those buttons to do?</p>
<p>I'm also looking for other debugging projects for inspiration, and I'd love to hear what are your essential debugging tools and workflows!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Like high ping for setting a high number value to a variable, low for setting a low value, some drum for reference access, different instruments for different mathematical operations etc.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if developers could learn to hear anomalies in algorithms and patterns etc.. Like "this is not how this algorithm or pattern should sound, so there must be mistake somewhere". Or learn to hear how values on a tight loop develop for example. Certainly it should be possible to at least hear if a value in a loop decrements instead of increments.</p>

Most debuggers use an "execution control" model where you are stopping (and potentially changing) the program as it runs.</p>

I was so focused on the debugging, I didn't realize are a bunch of other parallels that can be done!</p>
<p><strong>@Jarno Montonen</strong> I wonder how to make this in a way to make it sound good (or at least not terrible). I don't have enough music theory knowledge, but I'll definitely look into it</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ChrisKnott">Chris Knott</a> I'm curious, why would the "execution control" model be bad in this situation? I was planning on at most doing "record and replay" but just because it would be easier, I'd love if you could expand your opinions.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts!</p>

If you have a program that makes a random Tweet, or writes a file, then you have to decide what skipping back and forth over this line does - i.e. does it repeatedly execute the side effect?</p>
<p>In a normal debugger like Visual Studio, which doesn't record and had stepping back added on later, it repeats the side effect. I think users feel much safer playing with a recording which isn't actually running while you are debugging.</p>

I do feel that seeing how a code behaves for different inputs can be helpful, but if there are side effects, it will definitely be more confusing, and likely have undesirable outcomes. I'll keep this in mind if I decide to do an exploration focused on "execution control".</p>

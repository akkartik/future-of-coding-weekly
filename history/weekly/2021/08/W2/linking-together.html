Two floppy disks. 1 MEGAbyte of RAM. And look at Amiga OS, working under equally limited conditions and it doesn‚Äôt look that different from the OSes we use today.</p>
<p>This makes me hopeful that somewhere in between the space of retro-computing, where excellent minds use the quirks and specialties of old but well-understood platforms to make incredible things possible and contemporary computing, where so much more computational power is available to so many more people in so many more formats, there is a sweet spot where we can remove the complexity of accumulated cruft in modern hard- and software and we can remove the complexity of workarounds that were necessary on old systems to make things work that seemed architecturally impossible, to build something that is fully understandable by a single mind, works well, and does most of the stuff today‚Äôs computers do.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve personally never understood why most games focus on things like story, movies / books IMO are way better at linear story telling (I know some games do nonlinear stuff which is more interesting at least / unique to the games medium!)</p>

They're both overwrought labours of love, and they're both worth playing, even just for 30 minutes apiece. They are exemplary at teaching complex system dynamics through interactivity (something very relevant to our community).</p>

(I also have some headcanon about Braid's secret ending actually being about Blow's personal discovery of the concept for Braid and the ramifications thereof in terms of his life and career, and that makes the game more "interesting" to me as a fellow creator, but I digress.)</p>

So you might "get more" out of Journey, or Antichamber, or Passage, or What Remains of Edith Finch, or The Beginner's Guide, if you haven't heard anything about those games but have heard a lot about Blow's games and are just broadly interested in seeing what video games have to offer as a medium for conveying new kinds of narrative / experience.</p>

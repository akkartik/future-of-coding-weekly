I‚Äôve been chipping away (mostly solo) for a while on a FoC-related project for people with disabilities, based on some personal connections to the issues we‚Äôre solving &amp; frustrations with available technology. The core concepts have benefited a lot from gleanings from this chat and others in this space, and it looks like we (me + cofounder) have a good shot to take it from prototype to production aided by NSF grant funding.</p>
<p>The big question right now is we‚Äôre considering taking it in a much more open source direction for the next phase, with the hypothesis that this will be a better bet for the long term success &amp; growth of our project (not just the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù). If anyone has experience you think would inform this decision - open source maintenance/community development, commercialization models, massive flameouts, etc - let me know if you‚Äôd be up for a chat to either egg me on or try &amp; talk me out of it. üôÇ Many thanks!</p>

Thanks for the links!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not exactly a solution in itself, but I recently discovered sponsorware and it‚Äôs a nifty solution to a tension I‚Äôve felt before. Another vesting variant (over sponsors not time). <a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware"></a><a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware">https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware</a></p>

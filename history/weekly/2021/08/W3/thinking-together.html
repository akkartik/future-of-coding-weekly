How can it be more just and in general offer more options for participation. Since crypto is already computational native it extends from there that tools, coding experiments are needed to really implement these new ideas. </p>

<p>My use case is simple. I want to build forms, avoid crud and send email notifications without writing a ton of code. Probably my favorite so far has been <a href="https://anvil.works/"></a><a href="https://anvil.works/">https://anvil.works/</a> but even that was rejected. The most impressive was bubble. I will evaluate <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/"></a><a href="https://docs.budibase.com/">https://docs.budibase.com/</a>, <a href="https://enso.org/"></a><a href="https://enso.org/">https://enso.org/</a> over the weekend</p>
<p>Here are my gripes with the tools</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>JSON exports / Unreadable code generation - This just kills most solutions for me. For this reason I would much rather use tools like tailwind designer that generate readable Html5 code. Looking at you webflow.</p>
</li><li><p>Cloud Only - If the trend of cloud goes on any longer I will be calling all offline apps and command line tools lightning apps. Pure offline support is important. Self hosting is important. I love node-red in this regard.</p>
</li><li><p>Intimidating examples - My use case is simple. Most examples and documentation provide complex use cases. When learning programming in the text driven world, we start with ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, simple iteration, repl, libraries and shell scripts. Not only are these easy and fast to type, you can copy paste stuff to get things working. Copy paste is a killer feature of the text driven world.</p>
</li><li><p>Tie in with frameworks and using the browser for editing code - This introduces too much dependency and breaks my existing way of working.</p>
</li><li><p>Can‚Äôt re-use the components in existing projects - I think these platforms need to provide an api or hooks so that they are reusable in normal scripts. Perhaps 90% of the app can be designed in the browser but 10% can be done in the traditional way.</p>
</li></ol><p>Here are some good enough and free solutions - stencil, mongodb, python scripting, wordpress, webkit shell for mobile apps, tailwind designer for UI. For a team &lt; 10, these solutions are workable with email and all of them are free. These solutions are simple. Perhaps no code is doing too many things at once ?</p>

It is a specialized DSL that works with React, nodejs, Prisma, and in the future with other technologies. Would this fit some of your points? We don't have anything yet for generation of forms, but we take care of a lot of other things if you are building a web app that has frontend,backend and database - although I am guessing that might be an overkill in your case? Generated code is readable, so that is one thing, you write code in your editor, and you can use existing JS libraries. It is still Alpha though so I wouldn't recommend it for production usage at the moment.</p>

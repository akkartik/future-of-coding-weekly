<p>Software that deals with code in multiple languages usually needs to handle that code in a common format. But trying to capture complete language semantics for all languages in a single format seems hopeless. Instead, we’re faced with a trade-off between the variety of languages we represent and the thoroughness of the representation. On one end, text data is essentially entirely universal (caveat: encodings), but is very low level. On the other extreme, a given language compiler’s AST format fully represents semantics, but only for that one language. There are also some complete AST formats for families of closely related languages. Language-independent compiler IRs like the LLVM IR represent code in many different languages, but I think their usefulness is limited because they require irreversible transformations (they always would, right?).</p>
<p>I’m interested in the spot just above text: interface specifications that can represent code as basic data structures for nearly all languages, with little to no specification of semantics. So generally little more than a tree spec with room left for language-specific data.</p>
<p>I’m only aware a few specifications like that:</p>
<ul><li>as a baseline, s-expressions (not the textual format, just the concept of nested lists)</li><li>Babelfish’s <a href="https://github.com/bblfsh/documentation/blob/master/uast/uast-specification-v2.md">UAST</a> — they lost their web domain, so presumed dead</li><li>unifiedjs’s <a href="https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist">unist</a> — I’m thinking of adopting this for my structure editor because its ecosystem seems healthy and my project is in JavaScript, but to date it’s largely used for markup languages</li></ul><p>Do you know of any similar specifications? What are other projects using? Are you in a different spot on the trade-off spectrum?</p>

I picked XML over s-expressions because of better tooling support in various languages, and XML over JSON because of the richer structuring possibilities.</p>
<p>I had no intention of doing anything one could call universal, but then, XML or s-expressions may well be as close to universal as one can get: a tree structure. Now I wonder: is there anything beyond the tree structure that is universal about ASTs?</p>

All three are extension mechanisms for the language's parser, implemented in the language itself. Which means that a complete parser for either of these languages must include an implementation of the entire language.</p>
<p>In Common Lisp, this is not much of an issue except if you want to write a code processing tool in a different language. There is a well-defined representation of code after parsing, which is the level at which macros work. Moreover, reader macros are a rare in practice.</p>
<p>For Forth and Factor, parser extensions are very common and basically mean that there is no notion of an AST at all. As an example, consider the <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-xml.html">XML parser</a> in Factor. It allows you to embed XML documents in Factor code, not as a string but as a syntax extension. Superficially, Factor code is a just a sequence of space-delimited words, but with embedded XML, it starts to look very different.</p>

<p>So I guess the current best way to do this is having a culture where people try to commit smaller PRs more frequently, and frequently rebase their local changes on top of the shared branch. Are you imaging automated that a bit more to we don’t have to rely on individuals as much?</p>

<p>That is, why use something related to VCS as we know it for this purpose? I was thinking “we only ever actually run the most recent version of the code” and then realized that’s not true when I thought of migrating a cluster: then you have multiple versions of the same code running at once and (potentially) interacting with each other. Your system has to be thought of as including these different versions. Tangental but maybe relevant.</p>

<p>While this appears ridiculous at first I've seen some really impressive dimensional reduction things on Chris Olah's blog.

<p>I went to an algorave where there was a performance by two people editing the same code. They had two cursors and their edits showed up in different colours.

The goal is partly to figure out why people don't do real prototyping more often. We all know we should throw the first one away, but we rarely do so. The hypothesis is that we'd be better about throwing the first one away if rewriting was less risky. By the time the prototyping phase ends, a prototype often tacitly encodes lots of information that is risky to rewrite.</p>
<p>To falsify this hypothesis, I want to make it super easy to turn any manual run into a reproducible automated test. If all the tacit knowledge had tests (stuff you naturally did as you built features), rewriting would become a non-risky activity, even if it still requires some effort.</p>
<p>Turning manual tests into automated ones requires carefully tracking dependencies and outlawing side-effects. In Mu, functions that modify the screen always take a screen object. That way I can start out with a manual test on the real screen, and easily swap in a fake screen to automate the test. Which brings us to my problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you represent screens in a test?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently I represent 2D screens as 2D arrays of characters. That is doable a lot of the time, but complicates many scenarios:</p>
<ul><li>Character attributes. If I want to check the foreground or background color, I currently use primitives like <code>check-screen-in-bg</code> which ignores spaces in a 2D array, but checks that non-spaces match the given background attribute. In practice this leads frequently to tests that separately check characters and then go back to check colors and other attributes.</li><li>Non-text. Checking pixels scales poorly, either line at a time or pixel at a time. I've tried ideas like separate buffers for text vs pixels, so that at least text continues to test easily.</li><li>Proportional fonts. Treating the screen as a grid of characters works only when each character is the same width. If widths differ I end up having to go back to treating characters as collections of pixels.</li><li>Unicode. A font like unifont (<a href="http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html"></a><a href="http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html">http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html</a>) is mostly fixed-width, but lots of graphemes (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian) still require double-width to render. That takes us back to the problems of proportional fonts.</li></ul><p>Can people think of solutions to any of these bullets in a text-based language? Or a more powerful non-text representation?</p>

For example, saving draw calls instead of raw pixel values, tracking dirty regions/some kind of copy-on-write. Combining some zealous saving of state with some amount of recalculating can be pretty efficient.</p>

I meant it's hard to make tests that are self evident when they're about pixel events. Extremely long lines, etc.</p>

It's even just the syntax. In a complex app drawing to screen what's the cleanest way to represent desired screen state in the interface and get nice error messages (that use that representation) on test failure.</p>

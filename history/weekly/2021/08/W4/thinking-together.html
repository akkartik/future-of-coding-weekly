I am trying to narrow down what the magnitude of the improvement was.</p>
<p>Are JSON vs XML APIs 10% better, 50% better, 200% better, 10x better? Curious if anyone has seen any good numeric takes on that. And also happy to hear from anyone who disagrees with that axiom, but if so please share how much worse you think JSON is, numerically.</p>
<p>My ultimate aim is to try and numerically forecast what the potential gains from the next global notation could be, if any.</p>

Itâ€™s like bikes vs cars. Fast, lightweight vs safe, stable. Some debates never end or are they just programmer road rage ? Iâ€™m pretty sure people had the same debates about planes and zeppelins. Numerically it would be &gt; 4x in terms of development time improvement going by bikes vs cars analogy, especially for dynamic languages. I think it would be best to compare loc for  common tasks between the two. Json parsers are faster than xml parsers probably.</p>

<p>But when it comes to forecasting, I think XML was too complex, but JSON is too simple. Comments, yes, but also some sort of in-band indication of references and annotations would be quite welcome. Or maybe we just need a new standard format birthed by a language that has richer data (and thus richer literals) than JS.</p>

Though we're going back from REST to RPC (JSON-RPC, gRPC) more and more, and I'm not sure it's a good thing. But we'll see.</p>

An interesting intermediate is STON (<a href="https://github.com/svenvc/ston/blob/master/ston-paper.md">Smalltalk Object Notation</a>), which is indeed the idea of JSON applied to a language with a richer data model.</p>
<p>But there is another, perhaps orthogonal difference. XML was never meant to be a dump of some data structure. It always includes some metadata, in the form of tags. Pretty much all XML documents contain information that you could just throw away if you only care about data exchange between two software agents.</p>

<p>Another headache is more accidental complexity.

After 12 years of Javascript, I've had enough headaches originating from the fact that my objects are an amorphous unstructured soup. </p>

I want to aim at web developers, game developers … so I am thinking along those lines. I  want to increase parens in one case so that you can write code like or(and(x,y),z) which would translate to ((x &amp;&amp; y) || z) to improve readability.</p>

<p>That's a thirty year old (😱) piece and most likely familiar to many members of our community, but it still has some very interesting and relevant insights on design philosophy, programming languages and IDEs. In particular, it introduces a notion of program language as opposed to programming language, a sort of metalanguage.</p>

<p>Comparing his points about "future Lisp" with Clojure "the Lisp that could" is pretty curious. Also I'm thinking about Racket which kinda successfully lives in a sorta parallel universe.</p>

<p>The process of standardizing Common Lisp was so arduous was that the people who migrated in to it have forever been hostile to anybody and anything outside it. It's like, "I just finally got all moved in. What do you mean you want me to move out? And you're trying to poach my neighbors?! Enemes FOREVA!" Maybe I have the benefit of hindsight, but it doesn't make sense to gate something on a standard if it's going to be incompatible with it anyway.</p>

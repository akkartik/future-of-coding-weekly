I believe that algebra (as in "algebra 101") "calls on the linguistic part of your brain". For example, the linguistic part of your brain can apply the rules of grammar to the sentence "the gostak distims the doshes" to get other sentences like "doshes are things that the gostak can distim". Just as it can rearrange "a * b / c" into "a / c * b"</p>

<p>I don't think the above analogy is direct - at least not how I think. In the first case I do not use rules of grammar to do the transform. I parse and "understand" the meaning. There is in an internal model in my brain and a schema. So the symbols become objects in this compact model. Now this model can be used to generate other sentences that are related in some way - I can even subtract or add information E.g. "did the gostak distims the doshes yesterday?" or "The gostaks distim some things"</p>
<p>This is quite different from 'grammar only' transforms which are basically identification of patterns and application of rules to those patterns, without any "understanding". I suppose in smaller cases I could understand it, e.g. <code>(a + b) * c</code> is <code>a*c + b*c</code> - that is something that makes sense. But in more complex algebra, I'm just 'looking for patterns' and matching against a 'rule database' I've memorized.</p>

<p>Since the words "gostak", "distim" and "doshes" are nonsense words, your only information on them (the only information you can ever get on them) is what you can infer based on how English works. I.e. there is no semantics / "understanding to be had", only syntax. There's the illusion of reasoning logically about objects, but I claim that all you can hope to do with the sentence is to apply rewrite rules (that then FEEL logical)</p>

<p>The understanding is more abstract than in 'the kid eats breakfast' - but then how much of this sentence do you 'understand' too? Do you know what the kid ate? Eggs or bread? Or how - using their hands or utensils? Or did they eat it in a reasonable time? No - all that is detail that is left out. So its still a 'partial understanding' of the idea- there are many concrete possibilities of the sentence. The distims sentence is even more general. All we know there is an agent (gostak) and there is something that can be done (distim) and something that it can be done to (doshes).</p>
<p>I think the general pattern of 'the agent does something to some object' is a schema that we deeply understand and in our mind it can hold many similar instances with varying degrees of detail. Your original sentence immediately got parsed in my mind into this schema.</p>
<p>I agree that there is some kind of illusion - which is what I'm calling the internal schema and think all understanding is a kind of illusion - but isn't that the useful part of it? If you parse a sentence structure into the wrong schema, you will make the wrong internal model. This is where the language related jokes come from. E.g. the structures look similar but the schema is different for 'fruit flies like a banana' and 'time flies like an arrow'.</p>

<blockquote><p>Your original sentence immediately got parsed in my mind into this schema</p>

<p>I agree it's hard not to do this*. My point is that you can do certain things with the sentence regardless of what the schema is.</p>
<p>My claim is that algebra calls on the linguistic part of your brain, and that this is a part that can do sentence-rearrangement. Maybe the schema-inference also happens in the linguistic part of your brain. But the schema isn't required for sentence rearrangement.</p>
<p>Do you agree with me that we are doing productive/useful "work" in algebra with just rearrangement? You can then infer a schema, perhaps a visualization or physical interpretation, but that's optional and probably not unique.</p>
<p>*And I don't think you do know there is an agent. The gostak could mean something like "the general high temperature of this time of year" and distimming could be a reaction it causes. I don't know whether that qualifies as having agency.</p>

Rearranging mathematical expressions is second hand but rearranging grammatically correct nonsense sentences kinda hurts. Even just regular sentences kinda hurts (&lt;-- like, is this even grammatically correct?). I think natural language is somewhat more nebulous and the kind of thing you pick up on informally, whereas algebraic equations are manipulated according to a definite set of rules that you deliberately practice. So while natural language has an easier learning curve, in some cases it may also be easier to achieve mastery in algebra in the end. I'm not sure what would make the difference though.</p>

Long time listener of the podcast, but only occasional lurker here since I'm an armchair future coder. Just thought I'd throw out some ideas I've been mulling over to get some feedback on their plausibility.</p>
<p>First: A controlled natural language (CNL) like Attempto Controlled English for precise documentation. I'd envision a sort of CI pipeline where updates to documentation trigger a series of tests, and if the documentation doesn't match the code its paired with then the tests would fail. In the other direction a CNL seems like a great starting point for program synthesis from a higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Second: A math chat bot teacher.  Given a math question and its answer, can a program deduce the conceptual error(s) that led to any wrong answer? So far I have a list of possible useful technologies: SAT/SMT solvers, Prolog, ASTs, Lean, Sympy in Python. I haven't put in much actual work yet, but order of operations questions seems like a good (or easy) place to start.</p>
<p>After listening to an interview with Sal Khan of Khan Academy (on the 3b1b podcast) my pie in the sky idea is a chat bot that can help a student through the entire pre-k - 8th grade curriculum. Seems like a better idea than the one I had that expected kids to learn LaTeX.</p>

The 2 main barriers IMO are interfaces and hardware.</p>
<p>Interfaces</p>
<p>Most apps don‚Äôt even use most of the power of current PC computing super well. The common pattern seems to be to use ~500MB to show lists of data. But outside of games and some creative tools, most apps don‚Äôt even use 2D / 3D space that well. VR is even harder to design for (we‚Äôre still in the phase of people designing mice / keyboard in VR environment, similar to how film started out as just recordings of plays).</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>The hardware is still super clunky (my bias!) and hard to use, even for a gaming enthusiast / nerd like me! I think ultimately the general culture is also slowly starting to get skeptical of the idea of further escaping into cyber space instead of embracing ‚Äòthe real world‚Äô. Hence why I think AR may be more attainable than VR, but that‚Äôs also very challenging for many reasons (both hardware + interfaces).</p>
<p>I think as it stands, VR to me hasn‚Äôt provided enough compelling examples of what it‚Äôs doing better than traditional desktop / laptop interfaces. Most of the demos I‚Äôve seen are still just scaled up versions of desktop apps.</p>
<p>But maybe if someone created a non-textual, spatial, audio interface for some important ‚Äòjobs to be done‚Äô in VR ‚Ä¶ that could at least rely on the interface ship to compel people to deal with the hardware issues / limitations!</p>

Thats why I want it to work in the kernel directly as a display driver. I think gloves with finger sensors and some sorta key sensors can fix the keyboard location problem. I love the VR interface for movie watching but  desktop streaming doesn‚Äôt cut it for everyday  use. We should have had this by now!</p>

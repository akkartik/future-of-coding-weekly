All his research and work is moot and what is left is merely a pipe dream of personal computing. What worked in the real world was BASIC with its brazen gotos that helped some of the best programmers we know now, fall in love with programming. Forget about bicycles, BASIC gave creative minds jetpacks. It was ultimately Self and Javascript that succeed and not smalltalk.</p>

<p>I commented there with the user "notusinglinux" , I basically argue that to little effort was made to make the source of the project available, even if they didn't believe people would understand it. And IF they thought people would not understand it, why not create some kind of educational effort where to explore these ideas with a larger community? A MOOC or something related?</p>

It is certainly a complex project. Interestingly it seems the current generation of programmers learnt code via scratch, which is sorta inspired by smalltalk. Personally I grew up with Logo and Turtle Graphics. However since I read about the history of BASIC, commodore64, Amiga, Early Microsoft, Visual Basic 6 … I can’t help but think that BASIC was hugely important in influencing modern programming practices, well beyond what Smalltalk or daresay even Lisp ever did. In many ways BASIC is a dynamic version of Fortran. If you haven’t read <a href="https://10print.org/"></a><a href="https://10print.org/">https://10print.org/</a> you should check it out … its definitely eye opening.</p>

Its single selling point was that it ran on machines people could actually afford. For me as a high-school student in 1982, it was Basic or nothing. Easy choice 🙂</p>
<p>With hindsight, Basic didn't really matter. For enthusiasts, anything is OK to get you started. It's a different matter for people who need a gentle push to get interested in coding. If many of today's programmers got started with Basic, that's probably survival bias to a large degree.</p>

<blockquote><p>Adding hierarchical type classification can result in programming communities that spend most their time talking about the "right" way to organise the universe of type classes, and experience surprisingly dogmatic discussions about that</p>

It's one of those organizational concepts that has always sounded good in theory, but has always caused problems in practice.

<blockquote><p>Adding type-level programming of any kind can lead to communities where the most empowered programmers are those with deep expertise in certain kinds of highly abstract mathematics (e.g. category theory).</p>

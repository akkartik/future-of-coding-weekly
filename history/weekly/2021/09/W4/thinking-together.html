<p>So I find it easy to believe students are having trouble with it. File hierarchies are fundamentally a recursive concept, and those have a long track record of being tricky. I bet hands-on experience is the only way to really learn.</p>

<p>Yes, but also a lot of people with that title are essentially just analysts, so they use them the normal way. So data scientists themselves are split between the ‘explanation’ and (ML-heavy) ‘prediction’ camps.</p>
<p>I think “data scientist” is a pretty roughly defined term and it’s best not to take it too seriously.</p>

<p>it comes down to the power to say no meaningfully. full time employment ties your wellbeing to that of your employer. employers are fundamentally pro profit, or at least pro continuation of the organization generally (nonprofits don't tend to stop existing, partly because they hardly reach fundamental solutions, which... well, it's never incentivized)</p>
<p>code has immense power to structure the very fabric of our world. i got into caring so much about this because of overdraft charges in the US, which i thought, there just has to be a better way this could work. why can't this shit be more instantaneous and easier to reason about. turns out that was partly just a money making scheme by the banks, but also? the US financial infrastructure is absolutely awful. and websites were always full of awful crap that made my life unmanageable as an invisibly disabled person (autistic, ocd, cptsd).</p>
<p>every organization i've been part of in my decade of paid tech, no matter how nominally benevolent, has casually made decisions that harm others without consulting them. every single one. and i've worked at places that just like, taught literal arithmetic to elementary students. you'd think that could be harm free!!</p>
<p>in my time as an SRE at google, I realized just how fundamental conflict and disagreement is to software. i was repeatedly incentivized to harm my end users and spin it as doing a good job. i saw the tendency of infrastructure teams to say no reflexively, even when there was clear benefit to users, and people actively depending on and asking for the features. at the same time, higher ups were saying satisfying the end user is in fact the most important thing. that we should be talking to them, doing surveys, etc. when i went to implement this, it was used against me in perf as being on task. same for when i tried to defend our data integrity SLO against a migration that would fundamentally break it, right after we'd just adopted it.</p>
<p>i could've done better by those users if i'd actually been empowered to serve their needs. i could've done better by everyone impacted by my work across my whole time in industry, honestly.</p>
<p>but i would've had to be able to actually listen to and trust users and other stakeholders. i couldn't do that and advance professionally. i couldn't for a decade, and i tried so hard. but serving users better and aligning interests with them has never been in the interests of my employers, and fundamentally can't be in the interest of any for profit organization as we structure them today.</p>
<p>i think to do better we need platform coops where all stakeholders have governance power of some sort. literally all. i don't think we can ever make tech more usable or ethical without it.</p>
<p>the reason is that tech is a wicked problem (wiki it) space, full of essentially contested concepts (wiki it) (this is not the venue for deliberation over these questions, but) two examples everyone will be aware of in some way:</p>
<ul><li>what is a name</li><li>what is a gender</li></ul><p>really illustrate the point here. there is fundamental disagreement on these. with disagreements about such fundamental compound datatypes, the very idea of software correctness looks questionable at its philosophical foundations. correct for who? for what purpose? by what values? we can't even do the weak notion of software correctness we talk about these days, much less reliability or usability, and we're never going to get anywhere by ignoring the fundamentally socially complex nature of our work.</p>
<p>corporations aren't suited to address those kinds of questions. they can't be.</p>
<p>we've reached the point where tech is too personal, and as the personal is always political, corporations must try to grapple with political and social questions while being composed of individuals who are profoundly incentivized to never discuss such things bcz professionalism and for-profits-should-be-neutral-or-only-good-for-branding-reasons.</p>
<p>that's some thoughts.</p>

The infrastructure for cooperatively disagreeing at the societal level just does not exist. Bret Victor talks about model-driven discussion quite a bit (an example: <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange"></a><a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange">http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange</a> ) which would be a significant step up in how we do things.</p>
<p>I agree about ontologies being useful, rather than the oft repeated maxim that systems should be value-neutral, I think they should be value-flexible. And more importantly, that flexibility should be usable at a local level, at the level of individual users and groups.</p>
<p>We are dealing with large problems of scale in society now, the size of society is larger than the buffers of the environment it operates in, and it is vital that we find more efficient, and humane ways to communicate and coordinate, because the fallback is always a boot to the head (sorry, couldn't resist), since the most efficient form of communication is no communication, and the most efficient form of coordination is top-down command. But of course neither is at all humane. So, we are under a timer to solve these issues.</p>
<p>I look forward to a future where I can talk to someone, have a debate based on actual data, with all the provenance information available, without having to think about all the technology that ties it all together. But this is a political problem as well, of course, even more than it is a technological one.</p>

I like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sm2n/">S.M Mukarram Nainar</a>’s comment about "value-flexible."  There isn't going to be one source of truth.  So let's accept that.  And how much truth do we need?  For the task at hand, is name relevant?  Make it more operational, "name on birth certificate" or "name as printed on passport."  (I feel this being in the process of immigrating.  Oh man, I have a son who may have three last names depending, and my wife who has at least four first names depending.  And, come to think of it, I have two entirely different full names.)</p>
<p>Ontologies, there's a word don't hear much.  (I was adjacent to OWL back in the day.)  These days though, I'm pleased when I see people using RSS rather than whatever siloed "top-down" app-driven garden walling fiefdom building technique is dreamed up.</p>
<p>Lastly, it's interesting to scale down from the disfunction of organizations to the disfunction of individuals: even when we're well rested, actively trying to communicate (rather than self-deceive), and have aligned goals — it can be tricky to get a handful, two, even one person pointing in a useful direction.  (Think of a change to some coding convention, say the lifecycle of model objects in your software.)  So I guess as a prerequisite, a position of patience without complacency is where I have to start when surveying coordination problems.</p>

<p>There is one more aspect to political debates, which are related to technology as well but I don't see yet how they could be taken into account. In addition to having different values, and different information/knowledge about the outside world, people differ in attitude to risk-taking, novelty, etc.</p>

Reminds me of a great talk by Bryan Cantrill: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QMGAtxUlAc"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QMGAtxUlAc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QMGAtxUlAc</a></p>
<p>As for attitudes for risk-taking, etc, that is a good point. I think it indicates that a polyculture of communication/coordination methods are necessary. While there will always be failures in effective communication, I don't think it's the duty of us as toolmakers to design systems from the top-down to fix these problems entirely. But I do think we should give people the tools to communicate as they see fit. That said, I'd be interested to see if any research in psychology, economics, or something has some information about what the distributions for these things are emperically.</p>
<p>We just had an election where I live, so I've been thinking about this a bit and had this idea.</p>
<p>Political debates could be long-form with citations, on a mailing list or something similar, and happen asynchronously, which I think would work much better for actually debating policy. That said, some people just don't like reading long-form, so they could be summarized by third-parties (the moderating party, I guess) afterwards.</p>
<p>Finally, I think we should recognize one of the key types of tools people use and need are mental tools. We talk a lot about tools for thought, but I think tools of thought are sorely neglected. By which I mean education. We should seriously consider educational reform as something to be designed for. Not only can education change the energy barriers around communication, it can also change the meta aspects, such as effective risk tolerance via reducing uncertainty about the world, etc. The principle I have in mind is that access to information should be accompanied by the tools to interpret and understand it. Or more generally, that new capabilities should be accompanied by the capabilities necessary to regulate them. One innocent example is office tools. Stuff like Microsoft Word has awful defaults, and doesn't even try to provide some knowledge of typography to their users. The end result is everyone suffering awful design everywhere, which can actually have practical results—improper typography can be and often is hard to read, and likely wastes lots of time on the scale of society as a whole.</p>

It's of course a very good attitude for small-scale problems that you can fully comprehend. It's also a reasonable attitude for your own immediate problems. But on a larger scale, problem solving requires participation of all stakeholders, and tools that help people see, understand, and fix problems collectively, rather than being themselves the fix.</p>

And for "the end goal is to be able to infer semantics for all dynamic languages," Ruby is a great place to start since its semantics are nuts.  (I say this as a proud Rubyist since the turn of the millennium.)  Ruby is going to keep you honest.  I mean the very fact that people are productive in Ruby shows that one can model its semantics "isomorphic up to shenanigans," but my, my what shenanigans are available!</p>
<p>Let me share a little bit about my interests adjacent to this: (1) treating execution traces as first-class objects for debugging, (2) refactoring.</p>
<p>(1) When dealing with a relatively big framework ( let's call it Rails), its nice being able to see how all the bits are dynamically connected.  And one step removed form the execution itself, it's useful to ask the what-if at specific branches.  This leads to...</p>
<p>(2) The most common useful refactor I see in practice is the business logic tangle of conditionals where a complicated joint space (let's say six booleans and four variables depending on them, so 256 cases to consider) can probably be factored in a reasonable way, but I'd really love tool support for navigating that space, making sure all the cases are accounted for.</p>

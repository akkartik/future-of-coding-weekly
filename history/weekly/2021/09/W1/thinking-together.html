Or, alternatively, "what is the most common path travelers take before arriving at Greenspun's 10th rule?"</p>
<p>Is there something like "DSLS either die or eventually add identifiers, then functions, then branching, then macros, etc"? I'm curious if you can look ahead and say "well if this is successful, it will eventual require so many things, so might as well not do a DSL in the beginning and instead start with a GPL and build a library"</p>

<p>My first question when choosing embedded vs. standalone for a DSL is: is the stuff that you encode using the DSL more like "code" or more like "data"? In the former case, go for embedded (for the reason <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> gave). In the latter case, go for standalone in order to keep your data independent of a single language ecosystem, and thus more widely usable.</p>
<p>There is of course no clear borderline between code and data, all code being data from another point of view. But in the context of a specific domain, the choice is often obvious.</p>

If one is ‚Äî for example ‚Äî just writing a bunch of sensor readings from an experiment, one might as well do it as packed binary data frames. Whereas, if one is creating a specification/configuration language that includes constructs for things like conditionals and loops/recursion, it's already too late ‚Äî just use scheme/Smalltalk/FORTH and be done with it. üòä</p>

I thought a lot about this because my current project in DSL space is very much on the borderline. Leibniz (<a href="https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz-pharo"></a><a href="https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz-pharo">https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz-pharo</a>) is a domain-specific specification language, which does include conditionals etc. (it's a term rewriting system). But its reaon for existence is the documentation of computational models for humans, independently of any concrete implementation in code, so I ended up choosing the standalone approach explicitly to remove the temptation of the quick hack in whoever's favorite programming language of the day.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> had a good tl;dr.</p>
<p>More generally, I feel we underutilize the stack as a way to abstract.  Instead of explicit passing, build context through selective use of dynamically scoped variables.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I guess there's the aspect oriented notion of CFlow <a href="https://schuchert.github.io/wikispaces/pages/aop/AspectJ_CFlowExplained"></a><a href="https://schuchert.github.io/wikispaces/pages/aop/AspectJ_CFlowExplained">https://schuchert.github.io/wikispaces/pages/aop/AspectJ_CFlowExplained</a>.</p>

Classic RAM (I'm talking about the software abstraction, not the physical hardware) is just a vector with 2^64 cells, most of which are zero and not backed by physical memory. This is commonly known as a sparse vector. The current AI boom has made it obvious that higher-dimensional memory chunks, known as tensors, are an important idea, especially sparse ones. Other than being higher-dimensional, key differences between tensors and RAM include:</p>
<ul><li>An AI app will typically work with multiple tensors, but a classical app will only work with one RAM. (Though Wasm can have multiple RAMs, known as "linear memories", and of course, you can pretend to have multiple memories using abstractions like malloc).</li><li>Tensors can be subjected to unary operations such as slicing, permuting, and aggregation (min, max, sum, product), that generalize the boring read and write operations on RAM.</li><li>Tensors can be subjected to binary operations such as multiplication/contraction (generalizing matrix multiplication), convolution, and element-wise addition.</li></ul><p>The data of everyday programs is often very heterogeneous, which corresponds to having lots of sparse tensors. Sparse tensors need good support in software and ideally in hardware. Thankfully, there is AI hardware being developed that is designed to operate on sparse tensors, by way of dedicated circuits that can compress and decompress them. <a href="https://tenstorrent.com/">Tenstorrent</a> is probably the leader here.</p>
<p>Here's a fun fact: multiplication of sparse Boolean tensors is equivalent to a database equi-join. So if you think databases are important, then maybe you should give tensors some thought.</p>
<p>And relatedly: operations on tensors are typically massively-parallelizable, thus could be a good foundation for a high-performance programming language that compiles to AI hardware.</p>

I guarantee you that your 64-bits of virtual memory are mostly zeroes! And with a paging system, you can write across vast swathes of the memory whilst only consuming physical resources for the pages you actually touch. That‚Äôs what I mean when I describe linear memory as a sparse vector.</p>

That's the main enabler of a lot of interesting applications. Tenstorrent handles sparse tensors completely in hardware; as a programmer you work with them as if they were dense. For context: if you multiply a pair of 99% sparse tensors using a dense multiplication algorithm, you‚Äôre doing 10000x more work than you need to (repeatedly multiplying by 0). In general, the asymptotic complexity is different.</p>

<p>As for the tensor, yes, once you pick a basis, you get an array representation. But the whole point of tensor algebra and tensor analysis is that the tensor has a meaning (and properties) independent of the choice of a basis.</p>

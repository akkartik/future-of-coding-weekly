I ran a session on the weekend that was like a kind of reverse beginners' workshop. We talked about what it was like engaging with tidalcycles as a community as a beginner, trying to teach me how to improve things. It echoed a discussion I took part in with early career Black artists as part of a programme called 'algoafrofutures' - I learned there are huge hidden barriers to participation in the form of hidden hierarchies and norms that repel most people ('most', given that white men are the minority). It seems that many just don't want to post their questions to a forum or especially engage with a live chat system because of bad past experiences and the general attitude of the "men on the internet" who hang out there. It seems people who experience racism, misogyny etc are there, but are lurking or not participating (shout out to the lurkers! would love to hear what you think but, well..). Similarly with local live coding workshops in Sheffield, women-only workshops will be full but then only men will show up to open workshops and mansplain things to the woman co-running the workshop. This is serious I think - communities that repel most people in ways they don't realise, and which totally undermines their aims to e.g. find a future of coding for everyone (in the case of this community), or do something similar by connecting computer programming with performing arts and wider culture (in the case of live coding).</p>
<p>So what can we do about it, besides solemn introspection? I really enjoyed Emma Dabiri's work which challenges the response to BLM, from an Irish and UK perspective. I recommend her short book 'what white people can do next' and most recent appearance on the blindboy podcast - best to check that out than rely on my summary.. But her thinking is based on solid academic understanding of the nature of race, and argues not for allyship (which only re-enforces power structures) but coalition. I think I'll stop there as I'm interested in what other people think 'coalition' could mean in this context..</p>

Ironically, they are also excluded from international communities working towards more diversity, because they use English as well.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I saw a mention on Twitter of a workshop on "Programming In Languages That Aren't English" <a href="https://pilate-icer.github.io/"></a><a href="https://pilate-icer.github.io/">https://pilate-icer.github.io/</a>. Held in English, of course.</p>

I'm guilty of not knowing any language apart from English. The live coding conference tries to supply simultaneous translation between at least Spanish and English (there are really strong communities in Spain and across South/Central America) although we haven't been able to fund this professionally yet, it does help I think. I also make sure to edit subtitles for videos I make which helps hard of hearing folks as well as improving automatic translation to the point that they can be somewhat useful.. This is related to environmental breakdown and health emergency I think - as we get better at moving communications and conferences online we need to do it in a decentralised way that breaks down these colonial hierarchies.</p>

It's telling that the main reference is Bret Victor - of course I can't speak for him but as far as I can tell has pretty much disowned the programming community, or at least seems very disinterested in making tools for the currently existing community of programmers. I suppose the name "future of coding" is based on his "future of programming" talk, but as far as I can tell ignores that this title is (again, to my mind) clearly ironic - this (really excellent) talk was after all about the past.</p>

Pretty much everyone agrees it's important in theory, but when it comes to important decisions (funding, hiring), interdisciplinarity always loses out. No need to invoke negative feelings to explain this, although you may be right about the specific situation in CS which I don't know, being in physics and chemistry myself. It's just group dynamics, of the same kind that creates obstacles to diversity elsewhere. Take a group of specialists from some disciplines, and let them discuss a project. The only aspects that they will all view favorably are the common aspects of their discipline, so that's what all projects have to adhere to.</p>
<p>The larger lesson is that opening up a group to be more inclusive (in whatever sense: social, thematic, ...) probably requires incentives coming from the outside.</p>

However I find myself becoming slowly pessimistic about this whole affair of inclusivity. While I don’t consider myself particularly well read on the subject, it seems the problem is fundamentally intractable and not easy to solve by mere handwaving.</p>
<p>Given  two groups X and Y … there are 4 social outcomes</p>
<ul><li>X over Y</li><li>Y over X</li><li>X and Y live in peace while keeping their identities separate and independant</li><li>X intermixed with Y forming a new identity as XY</li></ul><p>I find that 1, 2, 4  create monocultures because the original identity is lost.  Ways in which groups can be separate yet  be totally co-operative are missing. When anthropologists go to a tribe, they don’t force their views on them ... they operate in 3.</p>
<p>To take programming languages as an example ... I am arguing for single paradigm languages without forcing every language to accommodate every style. Python doesn’t have types and that’s OK. Every community has strengths and I fear tying to create a “common community” is a bad attempt to create 1 language that is forced on everyone for their own “good”.  An organisation that uses multiple programming languages interacting via a common REST protocol is better than enforcing 1 language. While it looks inefficient, what I would like to point is that monocultures suck.</p>

I lament the discussion could be geared towards protocols. where groups can intermingle, where each group does its own thing rather than saying everyone should think the same way.</p>

This also ensures that each club can protect their group from intrusion and ensure its members are adequately protected, according their own needs decided democratically than by an external agent.</p>
<p>Each club keeps their identity separate and is organised around group achievements rather than artificial guilt induced by selective readings of history.</p>
<p>From my limited readings, this is something the Maori people have achieved to some degree. “White people” thinking they are Maori is silly at best and them trying to patronise and mother Maori is intrusive and unwarranted.</p>
<p>The guilt induced reading is a very narrow reading of history. UK was raped and enslaved by Romans and Vikings and the French and the Germans.  I would be more than happy to see UK and USA renamed to former slaves of the Romans and the French. English was considered a farmer’s language for quite sometime and the royalty spoke French but I digress.</p>
<p>I am absolutely not against inclusivity but I feel that there is a net loss when each group’s natural integrity is lost and replaced by an all inclusive “supergroup” that is poorly thought out and forced because of mere “good intentions” .  The noble intentions of priests has done more harm than good, in many ways is the reason why we are in this mess the first place.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken the Hacker ethic already proclaimed inclusivity as a corner stone. This chaotic but functional diversity is something we see in our programming tribes naturally and I wish more research was done in this area.</p>

You say racism / sexism / ableism, which makes me suspect you are US-based. For me as a German living in France, language-based exclusion is much more visible that it seems to be for you, whereas racism is a much lesser issue. Not that we don't have discrimination from the colonial days over here, but it's based more on name than on skin color.</p>

<p>Today that's different. I always feel the risk of being seen as racist or mansplaining or even hitting on someone. It's for me impossible to talk freely now with people from other races or genders, it feels like walking thru a minefield. Even when talking about pure technical topics. So I tend to avoid interacting with people of other genders or races because then I can talk free without risking anything as long as I stay away from topics like politics.</p>
<p>Today I'm very aware of race and gender, which lead to me treating people differently depending on their race and gender. I think thats a very sad developement because I'm a big proponent of equality and think that races don't even exists. And after talking to other people, I know some who told me that they act similar. Not because they want to oppress someone, but simply out of fear to be called a racicst or misogynist if they say something wrong or behave a bit to dominant.</p>
<p>So I fear that this inclusion and diversity movement lead to the exact opposite: People are much more aware of race and gender now, instead or caring less. Which leads to seggregation instead of inclusion. And while everybody wants diversity and equality, many act in the opposite direction now and exclude others out of fear of losing their job.</p>

<p>Now that we are grown adults, it's much more more painful to make mistakes. We don't need to segregate ourselves, but we also can't just move forward without realising the impact we have and the power we wield. Just like writing code, we have to grow and learn to align our intentions with our desired impact. Trust that people aren't generally out to get you, they are just living their lives and always remember that feedback is a gift</p>

<p>Example: gender focus (but plug in any other one if you prefer). Warning: numbers are made up.</p>
<p>The way tech is developed and deployed today excludes 95% of men and 99% of women from decisions that have an important impact on their lives. For me, the real issue is 3% (influential developers and their funders) vs. 97% (people who have to adapt their lives to tech). Can we fix that by focussing on the difference between 95 and 99? I doubt it.</p>

<p>One thing I might not be against it "proposing features or changes", I find it useful to hear how others see the solution. But I guess that is under don't so people don't get too focused on describing their idea instead of idea they are reviewing?</p>
<p>What is the next step -&gt; creating a PR with our project details?</p>

<p>1 hour to complete the project. Like, if the project is "Make a C/F converter" that sounds about perfect, assuming the tool setup process isn't hellish.</p>

It will feel like random people trying out our product, while we could learn possibly a lot from the review if they have some experience in the field or are potential user. I understand the situation with monologue, but instead of making it a "don't", which is very black and white, we could instead suggest reviewers to keep suggestions short / concise?</p>

I am wondering what kind of visualization tools exist that help me understand where possible bottlenecks are, which parts are active and where there is congestion?</p>
<p>The closest I can kind of think of is <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/graal.html">VisualVM</a> , but it is still kind of basic in the sense that it only gives visually access to stuff like fine grained memory usage, performance of subparts, which threads are active, idle, parked but does not give me a lot of insight in how the different system parts interact with one another.</p>
<p>I admit that I also don't know exactly what I am looking for and therefore don't know what I should be typing into my favorite search engine. I am sure somebody has built more elaborate tools in that direction and would like to hear your thoughts and suggestions of what I should be looking at.</p>
<p>So as an example, let's take a simple producer/consumer model on a channel. Let's say the producer is producing more stuff of than the consumer can take from the channel. One could imagine a node (consumer/producer) and a line (channel) visualization where one sees how active the producer/consumer is (via a red to green spectrum), maybe also one could zoom in to see which subpart is active and how full the channel is (maybe also via a red to green spectrum). That is just an example that came to mind in which the channel would be become dark red over time as it becomes "congested".</p>
<p>Keen to hear your thoughts/ideas.</p>

<p>Chances are that you rely on one or more frameworks, some of which might be custom made. Maybe you even have naming conventions for different processes or queues. To get value from the analysis, you will want to start from those and walk your way up.</p>
<p>A challenge will be the scale. However, before you tackle the scale, I suggest to consider tackling a small scope. For example, focus on a single message. Can you trace that through the system? If not, you might want to change the system to ensure you can - perhaps logging. Once you have that information, you will find that it’s much easier to aggregate it across multiple queues.</p>
<p>You might also find that it’s cheaper to create a tool that works for you than to adapt to a generic tool that might not fit, regardless of how fancy the look and feel is. A tool is most effective when it allows you to (in)validate your hypothesis.</p>

<p>You'd likely need to identify specific things that are measurable, or discernible, and speak to them. I don't know anything about Google Chat so I can't come up with a real example. But perhaps the better UX of Slack means you'd spend less time dealing with frustrating aspects of the chat system, and more time directly communicating and focusing on your work, not your tools. (Spitballing.)</p>

The idea is nodes would always have a single parent, and a fixed x/y position, and be connected to their parent by a tube, in which unlimited wires might be threaded. Messages between nodes would have to route according to these layouts (each node would have routing capability). To see the exact connections between nodes, you would likely have to hover over a node and it's relevant wired connections could highlight. Does the EE world have GUI tools that follow a paradigm like this?</p>

<ul><li>"Braiding" multiple wires together</li><li>A bus network</li></ul><p>I definitely won't balk at specifics of your example, since that seems like approaching the idea at the wrong level of detail. More broadly though: I think the thing that'd be required to make this work well is the same thing that'd be required to make regular old node-and-wire work well —&nbsp;a really, really polished UI. Now, it might be easier to do a really polished UI with something like tubes, since the concept might switch out some hard to solve problems (a visual rats nest) with some easier to solve problems (showing a subset of paths).</p>

I am sort of a fan of "nodes would always have ... a fixed x/y position."  More than that, I really like having strong rules about orientation.  Often you don't have a generic graphs, trees and DAGs are more common.  Following the top left to bottom right flow suggested by your Graph Layout, we can choose to omit most of the arrows.</p>

A different background color could be used to show edges that violate the normal flow.</p>
<p>Also messy graphs tend to arise when you have a lot of connections between two similar layers: a bunch of similar As all connected to a bunch of similar Bs.  braiding edges or stacking nodes can help in those situations.</p>
<p>Lastly, long distance edges are usually a sign that the distant edge is being used as a word, like a library call, and its connection to the rest of the network is more tenuous.</p>

<p>Agreed with William, locking node positions does sound really nice, and some software like SpeedTree actually have (or used to? haven't used it in ages) that constraint: you're not allowed to move the nodes freely in the graph, you just add them as you need them, and the layout sorts their position for you.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, this software literally makes trees, which are just ideal for node graphs 😄</p>

<p>A portal system could solve this, but portals are delicate and if you overuse them, which would be a necessity in this case, you end up losing the benefit of a tree structure readability, as a property called by the leaf could also happen to be used on a branch, root or anywhere else.</p>

I just came across a really old note about IUPAC naming in chemistry. Maybe particularly in organic chemistry. I wondered if there is a similar naming standard in the world of software. If so can someone point out to me? </p>

In chemistry, you know what your elements are. In coding, you don't, there could be many different ones. You could just name all your functions based on a lambda calculus like SKI and then name them according to their implementation, but almost every function of interest can be implemented in multiple ways. And there is no (general) way to figure out if two implementations are equivalent.</p>
<p>Put differently: maybe it is possible, but if it is, we haven't figured out the foundational science needed to do something like IUPAC.</p>
<p>What one could do is to have names that are not meaningful and build a catalog of IDs to functions, but that's very different from IUPAC.</p>

<p>Looks like IUPAC was formed in 1919. If you were doing something similar today, you could do it on Git, and make your standards in a computational language.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head some of the meta categories would be:</p>
<p>`*NumeralMap</p>
<p>*BooleanOp</p>
<p>*Machine</p>
<p>*Lang</p>
<p>*Function</p>
<p>*CharacterMap</p>
<p>*Pattern`</p>

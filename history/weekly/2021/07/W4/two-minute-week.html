<ul><li><p>We wrote our first public design doc, and added instructions to README on how to write them and where to put them. We will continue to do this for every new non-trivial feature, so that everybody can more easily pitch-in and influence what we are building! <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/master/waspc/docs/design-docs"></a><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/master/waspc/docs/design-docs">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/master/waspc/docs/design-docs</a></p>
</li><li><p>Our first-time contributor <a href="https://github.com/saatvikshah"></a><a href="https://github.com/saatvikshah">https://github.com/saatvikshah</a> did an amazing job of implementing a whole new Wasp feature: support for each operation to individually opt out of authentication! <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/279"></a><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/279">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/279</a></p>
</li><li><p>Thanks to hard work by our intern <a href="https://github.com/craigmc08"></a><a href="https://github.com/craigmc08">https://github.com/craigmc08</a>, we merged first part of new Wasp compiler, rewritten to use parser/lexer generators that use formal grammar, instead of using parser combinator library where we had to do all this manually. <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/274"></a><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/274">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/274</a></p>
</li><li><p>We implemented support for running custom server setup code. <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/285"></a><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/285">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/285</a></p>
</li><li><p>We brought Waspello demo app (Trello implementation in Wasp) to its MVP stage. This will help us develop Wasp for apps that require "advanced" reactivity <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/trello-example-app/examples/trello"></a><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/trello-example-app/examples/trello">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/trello-example-app/examples/trello</a></p>
</li></ul><p>Next couple of weeks we will go for vacation, but then we are back in full-speed! Wish you all a great summer ðŸ™‚!</p>

<p>First feature that adds alternatives to drag &amp; drop operations</p>

<p>Makes it easier to use on devices without a mouse</p>

Your conclusion is good: offer alternatives and treat drag &amp; drop as a pro user feature. Are you planning on adding Excel-like referencing by typing (<code>=</code>) too, or is that already possible?</p>

<p>Recently I have been working on making the Flowrunner-canvas editor available as a React component (currently just for my own usage, itâ€™s far from stable), and not only that, but I want to be able to provide custom ways of running a flow.</p>
<p>What Iâ€™ve shown so far is that flows are run by the editor itself with the node-types provided by the editor environment. Iâ€™ve already been experimenting with backend flows, where you can design a flow which has http endpoints and communicate with a the database.</p>
<p>What Iâ€™ve been doing today is compile a visual flow to webassembly, live in the browser ðŸ™‚ . I already wrote a litte webassembly compiler which runs in the browser, so all I had to do was parse a flow and generate the code that this compiler understands. Itâ€™s offcourse still very early stage, and I hope to show some more soon (currently this flow-type only supports variables and expressions, but the compiler has already support for functions, while loops and very basic memory manipulation).</p>
<p>One of the things that I already noticed , is that I need is to be able to have vertical flows instead of just horizontal in the editor ðŸ˜Š.</p>
<p>An image of the above can be seen in the attached thread</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll be back with a video soon!</p>
<p>Have a good sunday!</p>
<p>Maikel</p>

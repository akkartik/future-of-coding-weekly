Ever since I saw&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A">this literate programming talk&nbsp;</a>I have been messing with existing literate programming tools. After trying multiple tools, I ended up writing my own tool using python + sphinx + cog + markdown. I am calling it wheel.</p>
<p>Because of cog - I believe literate programming can enable many interesting things like arbitrary preprocessing and code generation instead of just mangle and tangle. In plannr I have experimented with adding some syntax to hylang, a dialect of lisp. I think literate programming is criss-cross programming üôÇ and enables feature driven development. I have documented my findings here&nbsp;<a href="https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel/why.html"></a><a href="https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel/why.html">https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel/why.html</a></p>
<p>Would love to&nbsp;hear you guys think!</p>

<p>I briefly looked through the ‚ÄúCode Walkthrough‚Äù of Plannr to get a better understanding. I wonder how you can get different perspectives on code besides chapters and pages.</p>
<p>Thinking in books: I understand that there is a table of contents and a linear flow through the book. There are also links. Is there also some sort of Appendix, Glossary or other forms of organization possible? For example, I found a couple of code snippets called ‚ÄúWebsocket Reply Handlers‚Äù that contained message types and handlers. I could imagine an index of all those that link to their implementation. Would that be possible / how would you set this up?</p>

You can get cross references with  <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">this tool</a>.  My current notion is 1 chapter = 1 use case or 1 complete feature with backend, frontend and tests.</p>

I really find this whole idea super interesting. I‚Äôve been keeping a written log of my programming progress with notes about features, implementations and screenshots. But linking that with actual code would be interesting. I believe a lot of challenges from coding comes from the lack of Organisation and verbalisation. And as described here, files/folders aren‚Äôt enough and seem to be rather hacks. I like that in Processing (.org), you can create ‚Äútabs‚Äù when a single code file gets too long. You create a tab inside the IDE but that tab isn‚Äôt a new file that you need to import. It is just a new ‚Äúsnippet‚Äù that will be appended together with the other tabs. I wonder: is Observable another example of literate programming? <a href="https://observablehq.com"></a><a href="https://observablehq.com">https://observablehq.com</a> ‚Äî I do have to say that your examples are better, because they have a table of contents! üôÇ In general I think that lists, maps, and other designed forms of access to code are really needed in contrast to just files, folders and naming conventions.</p>

I think <a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev">nbdev</a> comes close to literate programming. The difference lies in the flexibility of organisation and arbitrary reordering.  In literate programming you define chunks that can be reused wherever you want, whether in docs or code. If observable provides a named block that can be referenced and embedded anywhere then it gets close. I would emphasise that this is production code, not just examples which blogs and notebooks are typically used for!  Personally I find literate programming for noting down 1. todo‚Äôs 2. bugs 3. bookmarks 4, design decisions and history 5. build commands 6. tests</p>

<p>Toby Schachman ‚Ä¢ Cuttle, Apparatus, and Recursive Drawing</p>
<p>In this episode, I'll be talking to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mandy3284">Toby Schachman</a>, who many of you are surely familiar with thanks to an&nbsp;<a href="http://tobyschachman.com/">incredible string of projects</a>&nbsp;he's released over the past decade, including&nbsp;<a href="http://recursivedrawing.com/">Recursive Drawing</a>&nbsp;back in 2012,&nbsp;<a href="http://aprt.us/">Apparatus</a>&nbsp;in 2015, and most recently&nbsp;<a href="https://cuttle.xyz/">Cuttle</a>&nbsp;which opened to the public this past week. All of these projects superficially appear to be graphics editors, but by interacting with them you actually create&nbsp;a program&nbsp;that generates graphics. Their interfaces are wildly different from both traditional programming tools and traditional graphics apps. If you are not familiar with these projects, I strongly recommend that you actually go and play them (they all run in the browser), or watch the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Xack9ufYk">Strange Loop talk</a> where Toby demos Apparatus and explains the thinking behind it.</p>
<p>(And if Toby's work still doesn't ring any bells ‚Äî he was also at Dynamicland, and CDG before that. Heavy hitter!)</p>
<p>This episode was sponsored by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">Glide</a>, and the transcript was sponsored by&nbsp;<a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> ‚Äî&nbsp;thanks to them both for making this possible!</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2021-07-21T02:50:21.177Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="#2021-07-21T02:50:21.177Z" class="date">2021-07-21 02:50:21</a> <div class="message"><p>This episode was really weird to make.</p>
<p>I went into it a goal: to push the conversation in unusual directions. Most interviews are just a rote review of the guest's past work. I want to get the FoC podcast away from that. Instead, I'd like the show to be a place where the guest is challenged a bit, where they have to reflect on their work, turn it over, look at it from new angles. I think that'll raise both the hit and miss rate of the interview, but I can cut out the biggest misses in the edit (I've been doing that all along ‚Äî&nbsp;typically about 10-20 minutes of each recording session never makes it into the episode). I think it'll give the show an interesting energy, something that interview podcasts tend to lack.</p>
<p>Toby... might not have been the best person to try this with. Or maybe he was the best person, it's hard to say. Toby does a thing that I wish more people did ‚Äî when you ask him a question, he pauses and thinks about it for a good while. Then when he talks, he frequently pauses mid sentence, thinks some more, and then continues. It's a really admirable quality. He had no difficulty calling me on my bullshit, whenever I posed a question with inbuilt assumptions that needn't apply.</p>
<p>But... this meant a lot of dead air. A lot! So in the moment, recording with him, thinking to myself "I'm trying to push this podcast in weird directions", confronted with this copious dead air, I found myself dreading "Oh no, I've pushed too far, this is going badly, this is why nobody does this."</p>
<p>So at the end of the interview, I feared the worst. But, thankfully, after the edit, with most of the dead air tightened-up, I think it came through okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's a bit of behind the curtain drama. I'm going to keep pushing myself to get more energy (and weird energy) from the interviews, and we'll see how it goes!</p>

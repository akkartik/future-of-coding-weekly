<p>Our user base growth is slow. We discovered that 90% of people downloading it don't get through the first steps ‚Äì our onboarding and guidance sucks and we are working on it right now. Fixing it will take us a few weeks.</p>
<p>So, we come to an idea to manually onboard users by building any data analytics / data-driven process automation for companies that they need (for free and with no additional license cost - our product is Open Source and Free on Desktop usage). Our product, Enso (<a href="https://enso.org"></a><a href="https://enso.org">https://enso.org</a>) is really powerful - think of it like about Alteryx (<a href="https://alteryx.com"></a><a href="https://alteryx.com">https://alteryx.com</a>, $500M ARR), but more interactive, with better visualisations, and worse onboarding.</p>
<p><em>I would be very, very thankful for any advice on how to find / reach out to companies who might benefit from using Enso and would allow us to grow the user base faster. Would you mind sharing some ideas?</em> :)</p>

Each time I really want it to work but have found myself disappointed.  Last time I did this was a few weeks ago when it hit hacker news. </p>
<p>I ran into quite a few issue using it including long (multiple minute) freezes. I was trying to process a 2mb json file and I could not get it to work without locking up after multiple attempts. </p>
<p>That said, I'd absolutely love a tool like enso, so if you every want to chat happy to help as well :)</p>

Unfortunately, one big caveat for slightly larger projects was how you'd get so many default variable names that started to make anything long unwieldy. The text/visual syntax is cool, but the default naming scheme and even in the tutorials suggesting you to just link nodes (thus creating a ton of <code>operator7</code> etc.) means that you lose a lot of semantic meaning when going back to understand the code.</p>
<p>Just like how using single characters for all your variables in standard languages is bad practice, this default naming really gets in the way of maintaining and understanding code - a problem that the visual interface was supposed to solve, not introduce. I'm sure there could be interesting ideas of working around it (direct links convert to pipe-like syntax, only when multiple nodes refer to the same one is a name prompted for, etc.)</p>

I'm interested in making a little FRP-oriented library for managing motion designs and fluid transitions. My implementation will be for web, but I suspect there are a lot of ideas from other ecosystems as well (like data viz, and game dev)</p>
<p>Right now, I have some foundational "spring" physics to manage my input "t" step values. Next, I'm planning on designing a basic API for describing the property value mapping mathematics.</p>

<p>As a motivating example, one approach might be to create a data structure that contains a start value, end value, perhaps the current time, and perhaps some ease function (or spring, sure). Then, each frame, you increment the time and compute a new intermedia value to display. But then what do you do if, midway through the transition, the destination needs to change? Or what happens if you need to cancel the transition mid-flight? You'll probably get discontinuities.</p>
<p>A better approach might be to store a current value and velocity, as well as a function that handles acceleration with respect to some goal value (again, could be a spring). Then if you need to change the destination, you can just change the acceleration function, and the velocity changes smoothly as a result, and you don't get discontinuities. But what if you need to revert the transition, and return to the start point? You'll need to store that too.</p>
<p>If this is the level of design thinking you're looking for, the best thing I remember coming across is a WWDC session titled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/">Designing Fluid Interfaces</a>, where they talk about the stuff you want when designing an animation abstraction, plus how to design the coding interface so that it's artist-friendly (in other words, so that you can more easily predict what sort of motion you'll get when specifying parameters).</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>I would suggest jumping ahead to 7:00, where it begins talking about "interruption".</p>

Using a spring as the lowest primitive has allowed me to avoid interrupted motions. The talk looks really applicable and inspiring, thanks for sharing!</p>

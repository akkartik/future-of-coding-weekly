It‚Äôs like a breadboard for building software. You can wire up components, prototype, figure out, think, iterate. It‚Äôs a tool for creating tools. I think the closest reference I‚Äôve looked at is Fabrik (as seen in <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion">Ivan Reese</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex">Visual Programming Codex</a>).</p>
<p>It‚Äôs tough to share all the potential things it can be used for in one short video. I‚Äôll try to refine it through more videos and writing in the next weeks. üôÇ</p>
<p>The video is uncommented. So here‚Äôs a summary of noteworthy things:</p>
<ul><li>There are workspaces, blocks and wires. It‚Äôs like nodes &amp; wires, but with strict layout and user interfaces in mind.</li><li>This doesn‚Äôt try to replace code, but makes working with code easier.</li><li>Programming (dealing with data and organizing chunks of code) can be done visually.</li><li>Copy &amp; Paste as first-class citizen ‚Üí Code becomes tangible</li><li>By visualising and showing data, it reduces the mental overhead of keeping state and data in my head.</li><li>Wires are a tool, not a necessity (in theory, a workspace could have a single self-contained block and no wires at all)</li><li>Instead of  needing to wire up every input, blocks can define their own inputs through inspectors or by providing their own UI ‚Äì&nbsp;some blocks allow both: external inputs and UI</li><li>Blocks can have high levels of abstraction (no need to create blocks to do something easy like <code>a+b</code>)</li><li>Wires can be hidden and the program still makes sense because there is always some layout, user interface, ‚Ä¶</li><li>Various mechanisms for abstraction (wire up something, then copy the resulting block elsewhere), collapse blocks to hide data/UI, combine low level blocks (many inputs) into larger blocks (few inputs)</li></ul><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/573378340"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/573378340">https://vimeo.com/573378340</a></p>

<p>I like that you've picked a specific spot in the conceptual space for this to sit ‚Äî in between existing code and existing data, to make working with both better. I can see this being a really powerful alternative to something like Paw / Postman, and a good tool for building integration tests. I'll be keen to see what you use it for, and how you choose to refine it as you go.</p>
<p>What sort of feedback are you looking for at this point, if any? What sorts of questions should we be asking?</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-07-10T19:27:33.070Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Florian Schulz</span> <a href="#2021-07-10T19:27:33.070Z" class="date">2021-07-10 19:27:33</a> <div class="message"><p>Ha, Paw/Postman are good references.</p>
<p>Fetching data, extracting parts of it and listing results are common tasks when building apps (aren‚Äôt the majority of apps just lists?), which is why some of my first blocks were for data fetching, extracting and listing API results. With Ratio, I want to be able to move fluently from looking at data to the next step which is manipulating and rendering the data in a user interface. The interesting part is that I can build up a Mini-Paw, mess with the API/Data and once finished, can move on.</p>
<p>Besides lists, I‚Äôve been working with HTML and CSS parsers, building AST explorers / editors on top, eventually moving on to more visual design/dev tools. Incrementally progressing. The goal is to have useful tools at any time. Starting with raw code, followed by simple structure editors, onto more specialized UIs.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also built personal apps: time tracker, notes, todo list, reading list, ‚Ä¶ only to realize that this is becoming an user-programmable operating system. üòÖ</p>
<p>I‚Äôm currently not looking for specific feedback on the UI as I‚Äôm trying to focus on the bigger conceptual ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe some questions in return:</p>
<ul><li>What general questions do you have?</li><li>What would you like to see me build as a proof of concept?</li><li>Where do you think this approach might fall short?</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div></div></div><div id="2021-07-10T16:57:48.067Z" class="post"><span class="user">Rob Haisfield</span> <a href="#2021-07-10T16:57:48.067Z" class="date">2021-07-10 16:57:48</a> <div class="message"><p>I wrote a little bit of code to simplify a workflow so I would know what I‚Äôve processed already and what has yet to be processed! I don‚Äôt want it to be the case that every time I move things from my personal vault into my shared vault, I have to reprocess everything. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm feeling pretty proud of myself because I‚Äôm learning to code and I successfully executed on a practical personal project</p>

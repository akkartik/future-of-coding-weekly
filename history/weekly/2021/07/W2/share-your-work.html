<p>We've added a "portal" system to our node/wire based programming software GraphN, which instantly removed 90% of all readability issues you often have when wires cross over, creating a spaghetti-like view of your graph.</p>
<p>Internally, this is basically just a variable, but funnily enough, our CTO had implemented the system, but I didn't "get" how it could benefit artists until I started thinking of it as "portals" ðŸ¥² was really surprised that such an easy concept doesn't exist in most art-focused node graphs.</p>
<p>The interface you see me tweaking at the top-right corner is basically a set of "exposed" parameter of that graph, which makes it easy to create powerful tools for artists, without asking them to touch visual coding at all. If they ever get curious, they can always dive in and change stuff, of course.</p>

I'm interested in what you said here, but don't quite understand: "We've added a "portal" system to our node/wire based programming software GraphN, which instantly removed 90% of all readability issues you often have when wires cross over, creating a spaghetti-like view of your graph."</p>
<p>Do you have a before/after?</p>

So as an artist who might not have created the graph itself, instead of being overwhelmed, one can focus on the essential nodes / inputs.</p>

There, the idea is that if you have a graph with say 30 nodes, all of them having a total of 100 inputs/outputs properties, you can just right click on the ones you constantly keep getting back to, and "expose" them in an interface for easier access.</p>

Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/AdnanChaumette">Adnan Chaumette</a>! I totally get it now. It's a nice clean architecture. I also like the term "portals". Always seems to pay off when you can maximize the immutability of your graph.</p>

<p>But yeah, it's such a tiny yet major feature in node graphs, which really lack innovative/clever solutions to avoid clutter. It's crazy how little has changed since Alan Kay's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQhVQ1UG6aM">GRAIL demo</a> from 1968 ðŸ˜¶</p>

<ul><li><p>Added a js&lt;-&gt;wasm api (example <a href="[https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/core.html](https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/core.html)">here</a>, sugar upcoming so it looks more like <a href="[https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/sugar.zig">this</a>)](<a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/sugar.zig">https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/sugar.zig</a>))). From the js side the wasm api looks exactly the same as the node api, so you can share code between them.</p>
</li><li><p>Indexes are now LSM trees instead of, uh, unsorted arrays. Joins are no longer silly.</p>
</li><li><p>Distinct got a faster implementation.</p>
</li><li><p>Added a reduce operator.</p>
</li><li><p>Fixed a bug in pointstamp order by adding a new constraint to graph layout.</p>
</li><li><p>Lots more unit tests.</p>
</li></ul><p>Still not quite worth using, but might get there in the next month or two.</p>

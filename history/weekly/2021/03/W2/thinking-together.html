I think that's a really interesting distinction that highlights a tension in software development. Sometimes as a developer or as a user I want there to be guardrails. Does anybody have thoughts about whether there's a middleground between documents and apps? Can you have the best of both worlds?</p>

<p>I'm picturing a system where it's fundamentally, or foundationally a document, but the user has opted in to a set of restrictions that make it into an app. Sort of like Enable/Disable js for the web , but more granular and a richer ontology.</p>

I was wondering if there are any lenses or materials that can shift light hues. Intuitively, I think the answer is no, at least not "passively", since that would imply somehow changing the frequencies of the light waves, but I'm not sure. Say those red/blue "3d lenses" only filter the light allowing the red or blue wavelengths to get through, if I get it right. But light is weird and maybe there's something I'm missing, heh</p>
<p>This brings me to the meta subject, since FoC has a strict to semi-strict set of rules and I see some zeal in keeping things tidy (which is a good thing üëç), I was wondering if we could benefit from a #random channel, with a bit more relaxed set of rules üôÇ</p>

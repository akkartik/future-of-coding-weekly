<p>I like the mix of vertical and horizontal snapping, it can bring some new expressiveness.</p>
<p>I was wondering about the use of tiling for classical sequencing and wires for control flow or data "stream". When I used Max/MSP it was great for audio etc., but very bad for executing a series of operations, the wires add clutter. And I thought that tiling boxes might be the solution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The ‚Äúpuzzle box‚Äù is a bit like a structure of spreadsheet cells, except rather than an infinite grid, only cells directly connected to an existing cell are available. We differentiate the flow of power and flow of values, by placing slots for the former on the vertical axis, while data slots go on the horizontal axis. By default, cells snap into each other like a block-based editor, but can be pulled apart, revealing a wire when more space is necessary or flow is better demonstrated. Cells usually contain textual ‚Äúformulas,‚Äù which preserves the density of text and makes it easy to edit complex expressions with few actions. They can also have complex domain representations (e.g. the truth table above) that are plugged into and used directly. Using this feels more like excel than any of the previous editors mentioned. There are clear places for action - empty or existing cells - that you navigate to and start typing in.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The puzzle box takes the best parts of text, nodes, and blocks, while offsetting the downsides of each:
* We leverage the density and familiarity of text in each cell
* By using wires for branching and complex control, we can maintain the ability to easily understand the flow of the behavior (offsetting the 1D of text). Splitting control out vertically, allows you to quickly ‚Äúread the spine‚Äù and get the main idea of what‚Äôs going to happen.
* With the connected cells, we get the structure of block-based editors and can make it clear where actions can be performed. This also enables a primarily locate and act flow.
* Rather than pure text, we can progressively disclose the internals of the cells, including showing slots only when they‚Äôre part of the flow</p>

<p>It reads well:</p>
<ul><li>"Here is the part of the tree that triggers state changes when clicked!"</li><li>"Here are the parts of the tree that change appearance when the state changes!"</li></ul><p>Arguably, it would be even better if the "States" node could connect directly to the actual components in the live preview, rather than just the abstract representations thereof.

<p>The article you linked to includes three desiderata that Flutter supposedly fulfills (screenshotted below). But other than the cross-platform stuff ‚Äì which matters to some, but certainly not all, programming experiments ‚Äì they seem like criteria Typescript + HTML5 would accommodate. Or not, if there are ways Flutter goes beyond that I don't know about! But I haven't seen a specific articulation of how that might be.</p>

It was one of the first large-scale, commercial, multi-user online environments (a concept that seems to be growing in popularity these days...). The original authors have a website called <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com"></a><a href="http://habitatchronicles.com">http://habitatchronicles.com</a> that gives some great insights into the development of the technology, and the many personal stories that happened along the way. The thing that struck me the most was how rich and wide-ranging this chronicle is: I wish more projects had an ever-evolving historical narrative to go with them! Does anyone know of any (perhaps more contemporary) versions of this kind of chronicle? "Dealers of Lightning" (XEROX Parc), "Dreaming in Code" (OSAF), and others come to mind.</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[February 4th, 2021 6:29 PM] ivanreese: On Feb 24th at 7pm EST, there'll be a live art performance by <em>Emma Rae Bruml Norton</em> reflecting on the work of Doug Engelbart, titled <em>The Dada of All Demos</em>. I watched Emma's &lt;<a href="https://doodybrains.github.io/the-mouse-holds-us/|last">https://doodybrains.github.io/the-mouse-holds-us/|last</a> performance&gt; (which was, in my impression, about <em>the mouse as an output device</em>, so to speak) and found it fascinating, so I'm really looking forward to this one.</p>
<p>For an early taste, take a look at Emma's site for the event: <a href="https://complicatingthecomputermouse.net">https://complicatingthecomputermouse.net</a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt of the description:
&amp;gt; Channeling Engelbart‚Äôs energy, <em>The Dada of All Demos</em> will take &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY|The">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY|The</a> Mother of All Demos&gt; as its departure. Participants will engage in a collective scrolling performance lecture performed by Emma Rae Bruml Norton. The performance will seek to re-orient us to something which already exists in the world, something which we always already have a relationship to: the computer mouse.
The event is free, and you can register here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-dada-of-all-demos-tickets-137830164733">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-dada-of-all-demos-tickets-137830164733</a></p>

<p>I found this quote to be particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the reasons why I love working with a lot of these old unsexy technologies, is that&gt;  I want any software work I'm involved in to stand the test of time with minimal toil.&gt;  Similar to how the Super Mario Bros ROM has managed to survive all these years without needing a GitHub issue tracker.</p>
<p>I believe the best chance we have of doing that, is by gluing together the binary interfaces that've already achieved a decades-long consensus, and ignoring the APIs.&gt;  (emphasis mine)</p>

And you couldn't get at the underlying data to tweak anything. You only got access to the final gesture detection or a limited ik hand model.</p>
<p>I did a few internal toys, like using my hands to drive a presentation at the job I was in at the time. I also tried to use it for surface tracking instead of full 3D tracking, but unfortunately, I wasn't very successful there either. The unreliability made it a nice parlor trick, but impractical. This was about 4 years ago, bear in mind.</p>
<p>I haven't given up on the concept of hand tracking. The algorithms continue to improve, and I think we will see a lot more cool stuff in this space in the future: <a href="https://youtu.be/MbZ0ld1ShFo"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/MbZ0ld1ShFo">https://youtu.be/MbZ0ld1ShFo</a></p>

<p>In the podcast service I use, there's a "public" setting and an "unlisted" setting. I had thought "unlisted" would just allow the episode to be streamed if you had a link, but it also sent the episode out to all subscribers. So.. that sort of blew our cover.</p>
<p>Kartik has very kindly, very masochistically, very kindly offered to take a crack at cleaning up the transcript, since that's something I used to do that I'm <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CEXED56UR/p1612408693044100"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CEXED56UR/p1612408693044100">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CEXED56UR/p1612408693044100</a> going to be doing in the future.</p>
<p>So yeah, I was just giving him a bit of time to do that before posting an announcement. At the same time, I figured someone would probably say something. So it was just a matter of time. No sweat!</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. To be honest, listening back to it a year after the fact (this interview was recorded in Jan 2020), I keep thinking "How the fuck did I come up with such good questions? This doesn't feel like me." So.. chances are good that I blow it on the next one, but it was a good run while it lasted :P</p>

Inspiration has tremendous value! Same for John's work here. This is also one of the (many) reasons I think artists are so important to the future of tech. As an example, consider John's "let's move this work item between screens" demo in the above video to what French digital artist Cyril Diagne is doing here:</p>

I will just give one more lens to maybe help you see what I'm getting at: when I do science, I'm driven by curiosity. I want to find something out, scratch an itch, imagine a possibility and chase it down. When I do engineering, I look around for the parts that I can assemble to solve a problem in the sense you seem to be indicating here. Often, the things I use in an engineering context are things that were invented in the course of working in the scientific mode. The artistic mode and the scientific one are exactly the same for me in my own practice, and they both benefit the engineering mode by providing these possibilities.</p>
<p>(I should add that quite often an engineering problem is what prompts the curiosity that leads me to chase something in the scientific mode. The above schematic is an imperfect map to the phenomenological territory, but it serves to convey my support for all these modes of action and their outputs.)</p>

I can totally get behind what you are saying. But there is something about the demo above that triggers me.</p>
<p>The demo above looks like pure theater to me. Oh, you can sort these images by color in a fancy moving animation? Why? And when he calls his colleagues on stage and they do‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ exactly? His hand movements are overly expressive, more than they need to be, even for 2010 technology. (Which is important for what Tom Cruise does in the movie! It would be boring to watch otherwise.) That looks like theater to me. It feels staged for impact without having a real message.</p>
<p>Bret‚Äôs demos some would also consider staged. If they are, then they are staged (well) for making a point. And impressively so. I can get behind that!</p>

<p>Both artists and scientists, when they do real work, work for something. They have substance. Or at least they strive for it.</p>

As someone else in the conversation pointed out, many would consider a bit of stagecraft an improvement after a day of presenters mumbling through dry presentations featuring illegible slides. I think it's important to keep in mind that different audiences need to hear things said in different ways, and that what seems like hollow showmanship to you might be exactly what inspiration looks like for someone else.</p>

<p>During the drawing of the rhombus, I was wondering how it was going to enforce that the sides were the same length. I was imagining some kind of slightly clumsy thing where they were tied together with shift+drag or something.</p>
<p>The actual solution is that it infers it from the fact that they are equal length.</p>
<p>I think this is actually a really keen insight into how normal people think vs programmers.</p>
<p>Interesting that the same technique was not used for the colours. Wouldn't it also be a safe assumption that colours that are the same in your "example" drawing are meant to be the same in the definition? When you have an explicit, editable, textual definition right there I feel like the bar is raised right up for making these kind of assumptions.</p>
<p>It also has this nice side effect, a little bit like unit testing, where it forces the user to draw the most generic version of the object, where nothing happens to be the same, only things are defined to be the same</p>

In my mind, DCI should be doable with language convention alone. Dynamic languages (or langs that support dynamic invocation) are best suited, as method chains will be overridden. DCI also prefers true object-based languages, vs class-based (though Trygve's collaborator Jim Coplien has built DCI systems in C++ and Java, too ‚Äì&nbsp;and has defined a custom DCI language charmingly called <code>trygve</code>).</p>
<p>The idea of DCI is essentially that a model can have a "role" snapped onto it as needed, which provides behavior for the model. When you need the system to do something (ie, a use case), you have a use case object load data models, snap roles on them, and the roles provide new functions ‚Äì run the functions, then release everything (data model objects go back to being plain vanilla without particular role behaviors).</p>
<p>What this does is deconstruct &amp; relieve the pressure put on traditional objects (at least the 90s-00s notions of objects) to be all things for all use cases. Instead, a model primarily becomes just Data (the D in DCI) that can perform different Interactions in different Contexts.</p>
<p>It cleans up a codebase because what you primarily see are use cases (context object definitions), and then the models and roles that fulfill the use cases. It's easy to learn what a system can do, and the code reveals in a straightforward way how behavior is implemented.</p>
<p>I haven't used it outside of database-oriented projects (tables are nice forcing functions to define models). It worked perfectly in rails. I'm not sure how I'd use it in a strongly-typed language. I think it has a lot of untapped potential.</p>

In one system, which provided an infrastructure service, a useful model was a NetworkInterface, that represented fields like eth0, mac address, local IP. </p>
<p>It also had enough data that we could assign it a role as a SwitchPort, with functions that could communicate directly to switch firmware.</p>
<p>One use case was to ChangeSubnet, to move a machine NIC to a different network. The ChangeSubnet object could load the NetworkInterface(s) required for the request, add the SwitchPort role to the NetworkInterface, call a SwitchPort function to essentially change to a new switch port, and then update the NetworkInterface model fields accordingly. So in the end, the machine ended up on a new network, and the state of the row of the NetworkInterface table was properly kept up-to-date.</p>
<p>In our top level folder, there's a ChangeSubnet ruby file. You look into it to see how the business is done, and how the SwitchPort role is defined.</p>

<p>The idea sounds similar to what you mentioned <strong>@Cole Lawrence</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would personally gravitate towards in comparison to patterns more compatible with data-oriented programming (often found in Rust) Do have any resources about <code>data-oriented programming</code>?</p>

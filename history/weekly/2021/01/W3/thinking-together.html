I've written a blog post about the topic and would be interested to hear your thoughts. I have a couple of ideas how my dream system would look like and have started building a prototype. I hope to find time to write about that soon.</p>

Users then have the options (1) RPi or similar at home, implying router configuration or (2) renting a VPS for hosting. Service providers could then jump in and make (2) a zero-effort approach.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a busy first three weeks and I‚Äôve already learned a lot, which I hope to share eventually. I‚Äôm even more convinced now that Alexander has figured out a deep truth about designing and building beautiful things that absolutely needs to be adapted to the software world.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd love to invite those here who are interested in Alexander‚Äôs work to connect so we can attempt to bridge the two communities ‚Äî in which way exactly I‚Äôm still contemplating and open to suggestions. At least I wanted to start a thread here which could become anything from an AMA about the course to a beacon for those who‚Äôd be interested in activities that might happen around this topic spanning both communities (I could picture an online event bringing us all together).

It doesn't feel right to spam this group with all the details as that's arguably borderline off-topic, so I've been looking for a good way to have a discussion with those all-in on Alexander elsewhere. This will also enable me to bring people together across a few different communities.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a good experience with a pop-up Telegram chat group that was hosted temporarily after an online event for further discussion. This seems like a good light-weight format for the purpose I have in mind. There's no great master plan, just a few little ideas I'd like to develop further with you.</p>
<p>If you are interested in upcoming activities around Christopher Alexander, his magnum opus <em>The Nature of Order</em>, and how to apply his theories to other domains (software and technology in particular), I'd like to invite you to join me here: <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP">https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP</a></p>
<p>This is a low-volume announcement-ish channel if you just want to stay up to date on what's happening. And there is a linked chat if you want to engage in a more active capacity ‚Äî asking questions, discussing concepts, suggesting ideas, and more.
Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

I'm not sure if this is a novel insight or not, but there seems to be some form of equivalence between reading/writing code textually vs with blocks/shapes and the equivalence of algebra/geometry.
There are many proofs and problems that seem to lend themselves to geometry over algebra but there are also situations that being able to reason about something algebraically makes it substantially simpler. I think this is the situation where you need both and it's possible at certain levels of abstraction you would want to be able to easily shift back and forth. For example I could imagine a system that had components built in a textual representation but then the component linking all done utilizing shapes.</p>

<p>This little thread is melting my mind: <a href="https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151"></a><a href="https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151">https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151</a></p>
<p>My mindset for the past 5 years has been that UX = gradual teaching on demand = never lying to the end-user, which implies never telling big lies, only little white lies that are easy to push aside to learn more. But at the heart of everything I did is the big lie that I'm programming "a" single unitary computer.</p>
<p>I've always known about many little controllers in our computers, but my mind treated them as exceptions. I think society has this consensual hallucination that software runs "on top of" hardware. The past six months (starting from my old realizations about BIOS: <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300</a>) have been a slow, painful journey to come to grips with this fact.</p>
<p>Bat signal to <strong>@Charlie</strong>; this is fodder for your old thread from May 2019 that most software is built across collections of computers. <strong>@Ian Bicking</strong> too had a post around the same time that messaging and communication are all, that decomposition is trivial, that focusing on "programming" is often a modernist approach. If we started from the assumption that "coding" is about orchestrating groups of computers, what would we do differently? What does the UX for programming look like if you also have to specify where computations happen? It seems to make Bret Victor's problem much harder. But following Alan Kay, perhaps we don't yet have the "hardest and most profound thing to then build every easier thing out of".</p>
<p>I'm also thinking about Dave Ackley's <a href="https://movablefeastmachine.org"></a><a href="https://movablefeastmachine.org">https://movablefeastmachine.org</a>. He started out in security, so he likely knew all this when he started out on his project. You can't secure your computing substrate if you aren't thinking about 90% of the computers in it.</p>
<p>Anyways, likely the fever dream will break in a day or two and I'll go back to lying to myself programming my little computer. But I thought I'd throw this out while it's fresh.</p>

The system takes care of that for us, and we get to benefit from faster image (de)compression or video de-/encoding or disk encryption etc. with API calls that look just like any other API call, but hook into these other processing units offloading some work from the CPU.</p>
<p>But that's just half the picture. We also more and more program different processors explicitly, with completely different paradigms: CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, ‚Ä¶ If your OS lights up pixels on a screen, but doesn't utilize the dedicated graphics processing capabilities of your hardware, you are not using your system "correctly". Or at least as effectively and likely also efficiently as you could (should?).</p>
<p>And it's only going to get worse, because this complexity is not going to go away. Now with Intel under extreme pressure the times of standardization are over. Sure, everybody will have SoCs soon, and it looks like a form of simplification. But market forces push everyone to differentiate, which will only lead to more complexity on that level. There might be a swing back to the opposite in the far future, when the landscape is much more fragmented than it is today and the commercial benefits of diversification have been used up so that consolidation can kick in again. Until then, it's going to be messy for a while.</p>
<p>I wonder if projects with the goal of simplifying the stack are better off building against a virtualization layer instead of trying to keep up with the further diversifying landscape of hardware architectures. Basically, bring your own (virtual) machine (and perhaps even instruction set), and let the virtualization/emulation figure out translation to actual hardware instructions. You'll likely do exactly that for testing already anyway.</p>

The biggest problem was getting data from the CPU to the GPU and back. GPU's had relatively small onboard memory at the time, and it was very easy to saturate the PCI bus when trying to move the data back and forth. It proved to be a huge bottleneck, and really broke any illusions of "a single machine."</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps all programming is distributed programming?Yes, yes, yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its just that we have established models and tools to create a "single computer" abstraction out of certain kinds of smaller computers, e.g. the "PC" bundle.</p>
<p>One way I look at this is to see a bundle as having observable, consistent states and "inner bundles". Consider this statement in a C like language:</p>
<p><code>i = j + 1</code></p>
<p>This "C-system" (language + runtime) executes the above statement - you have values for i and j, then after the step, you have a new value for i. To simplify you have the "state before" and "state after". But if we look at the same system as a collection of "inner-systems", the transition consists of various nested states such as moving bits from memory to a register, an operation on the register, then moving it back to anther place in memory. Now the question is: if the first MOV has happened, but addition has not, what is the state in terms of the C-computer? It's not inconsistent, maybe it's in transition? Certainly it is on its way to being consistent and visible in outer system. We can go deeper than MOV - a register isn't a single physical array of memory in the CPU (neither is a "location in memory") - theres caches and other kinds of inner-systems all the way. One observable transition in the outer system contains many transitions in the inner systems.</p>
<blockquote><p>What does the UX for programming look like if you also have to specify where computations happen?This has been on my mind too and I think for certain parts of programs, we specifically don't want to specify where the computation happens. This is what I sometimes call topology independent programs. Note that location presumes a addressing space. Above, in the C-system, there is no location (the C-system is whole world) and when we zoom into it, we see locations such as cpu, ram, AX, BX or whatever. The compiler made that mapping for us - it organized the inner systems to appear as if its one outer system. (But we could have too, and there are many alternative locations and ways to map that would have all worked out just fine). However if we zoom out from the C-system to a distributed database (or whatever it is part of), the single C-system is now one location in a larger address space, but the database-system will have location independent concepts like a table. I think to specify where computation happens, we need to build this idea of mapping the outer-system meaning to the inner-system meaning and distinct address spaces. To do this in a general way would mean we can always scale out to the next level using the same mapping ideas as we did at the previous step out.</p>

It corresponds nicely to how people perform symbolic manipulations by hand. It's also much easier to reason about than distributed computing models.</p>
<p>Given that the Turing Machine abstraction won't (and shouldn't) go away, let me rephrase the topic of this thread: should it be the dominant abstraction for developing software system? Certainly not. Perhaps the mistake is to consider it a more fundamental abstraction than distributed models, and try to implement the latter in terms of the former. Perhaps it should be the other way round: implement the Turing Machine as a high-level abstraction on top of a more powerful one, as a useful simplification to use when appropriate.</p>

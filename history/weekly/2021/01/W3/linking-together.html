<p>The ideas of APL and its successors, the array programming languages, were two generations ahead of their time. These languages are based on the notion that everything is a tensor, and all operations are rank-polymorphic: they extend automatically to tensors of any rank. These ideas are perfectly suited to an era of machine learning, large scale data, GPUs and other accelerators. Building on recent academic research, we are building ShapeRank, a new statically typed, purely functional language for industrial use, that extends rank-polymorphism to streams. We‚Äôll introduce the key ideas and show how they are realized in ShapeRank.</p>

We have cathedrals of greater and lesser quality - WebAssembly, CSS, React, Haskell, Mathematica, etc. - but rarely does good design coincide with popularity.</p>
<p>I do not see the utility of taking a moral tone. What's the point in saying someone is "selfish" for wanting to build a cathedral instead of becoming a businessman? Even if I were a businessman I don't see how it would be financially viable to build what I want to build. Are you suggesting that the market value of a thing is equal to the benefit to society of that thing? That's obviously not true, otherwise people would not rely so much on software whose market value is zero.</p>

Software is a product with high up-front investment requirements but near-zero marginal cost when used. That's not incompatible with market mechanisms, but very different from the markets that economists have been studying for a few centuries. Moreover, well-designed foundations are best thought of as enabling infrastructure, and thus a public good.</p>

I think that most existing software artifacts give "the user" - the society something to reflect on. Now since software can be very flexible. The question is , what kind of relationship forms this between the people creating the software and the people using the software. What kind of software should be created by others/3rd parties and what should  be created by people themselves. Abstraction comes at a cost. The cost in how to think in this model of software and all the effort involved to be able to think in this model are real. This kind of complexity is not very well understood by society. Instead society is happy to bounce off this responsibility towards "the computer industry" - the market? Its very hard if people in society can't tell what they want , let alone talk to each other,</p>

<p>Interesting to see argument for end user programming from 2004. It also uses ‚ÄúMeta-Design‚Äù definition i haven‚Äôt seen before</p>
<blockquote><p> Meta-design characterizes objectives, techniques, and processes for creating new media and environments that allow ‚Äúowners of problems‚Äù (or end-users) to act as&nbsp;<u>designers</u>. A fundamental objective of meta-design is to create socio-technical environments that empower users to engage actively in the continuous development of systems rather than being restricted to the use of existing systems.</p>

Thanks. Something I'm focusing more on in 2021 is to get the conversation started about #abolishcopyright and #abolishpatents. I don't want to have that discussion here, since it can get pretty political, however I have found that there are a lot of people who have come to the conclusions that I have, that reform isn't the way to go and we need to fully abolish. Given that there are no organizations yet (at least in the US, AFAIK‚ÄîI think worldwide the Pirate Party may be more established), working on that and giving a voice to people who have that stance, if you happen to already agree feel free to get in touch (<a href="mailto:breck7@gmail.com">mailto:breck7@gmail.com</a>). Again, if you don't have that stance would love to debate it, but not here. Think politics should stay out of FOC üôÇ</p>

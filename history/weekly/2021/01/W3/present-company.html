Or even something a little more high-level, for doing collaborative editing? I control the editor (clients), the data model, and the server. I'd like something that helps handle conflict resolution concurrent changes to the structure of data. Curious to see what options are available. I'm definitely not looking for something tied to any particular framework (eg: React, Express, etc) ‚Äî just something that works with vanilla JS.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>@Don Abrams</strong>&gt; : I‚Äôd recommend operational transforms if you have a server involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My server is just dumb data storage and presence for clients. It's not going to be running any of the editor logic, and I think the cost of involving it in the concurrent editing (eg: having it update a canonical copy after each edit) would outweigh the benefit of using OT instead of CRDTs. I'm not worried about the memory growth of CRDTs at the scale I'd be using them (fairly coarse), and I'm not worried about invalid states, but it's good to know that those are sticking points. Thanks!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NickSmit_">Nick Smith</a>&gt; : Regarding ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to implement CRDTs‚Äù, isn‚Äôt the logic really damn simple? [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple or not, there's a bunch of factors and tradeoffs to consider when writing something like CRDT structures/functions: correctness, performance, memory, API design, quality-of-life features, identification of common pitfalls, development time cost, mental overhead, and umpteen more. I'm currently just considering using CRDTs (or OT, or something else) in service of adding collaborative editing features to a tool I'm building. The collaborative editing is not a key feature, it's something I'm exploring as a might-be-cool option. I need to keep most of my focus on the domain problem my tool is addressing. This is why a library that already weighed those tradeoffs and made some coherent and well-justified decisions about them would be nice.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>@Cole Lawrence</strong>&gt; : What kind of data? Is it something like a node &amp; edge based editor or something more like structured text? [...] Do you have offline editing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's sort of like a small spreadsheet, without formulas, where the main interaction is that you can swap any two cells. Stupidly simple. There will be offline editing, but I'm not worried about the case where wildly divergent offline edits need to be coherently reconciled later. There will be versioning (outside/above the level where CRDTs / collaborative editing comes into play), and that's where conflicting divergent offline edits can be resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone!</p>

It doesn't feel right to spam this group with all the details as that's arguably borderline off-topic, so I've been looking for a good way to have a discussion with those all-in on Alexander elsewhere. This will also enable me to bring people together across a few different communities.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a good experience with a pop-up Telegram chat group that was hosted temporarily after an online event for further discussion. This seems like a good light-weight format for the purpose I have in mind. There's no great master plan, just a few little ideas I'd like to develop further with you.</p>
<p>If you are interested in upcoming activities around Christopher Alexander, his magnum opus The Nature of Order, and how to apply his theories to other domains (software and technology in particular), I'd like to invite you to join me here: <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP"></a><a href="https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP">https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP</a></p>
<p>This is a low-volume announcement-ish channel if you just want to stay up to date on what's happening. And there is a linked chat if you want to engage in a more active capacity ‚Äî asking questions, discussing concepts, suggesting ideas, and more.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

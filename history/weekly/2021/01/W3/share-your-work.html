But I'm biased - I've thought RDBMSs sucked for maybe 15 years or so. It sounds like this kind of DB will automatically optimize itself by automatically noticing when it would be useful to have a particular kind of index... or something?</p>
<p>Datalog has 5-tuples (entity, attribute, value, transaction_id, delete_flag). What is the id in [id, entity, attribute, value] and why is this used instead of the last two items in that tuple?</p>
<p>You said that "a list of id-entity-attribute-value tuples is enough to model any data." No doubt you could; it doesn't follow that you should though. In his talk Norbert Wojtowicz mentioned that there were cases when he wouldn't use Datalog for something.</p>
<p>When I looked at your code:</p>
<pre><code>identifier(0) : Attribute {

  Attribute.value-type = String

  comment = "..."

}</code></pre><p>I thought to myself, as I usually do, that this was similar to <a href="http://loyc.net/les/"></a><a href="http://loyc.net/les/">http://loyc.net/les/</a>. Have you heard of it? I'm just starting to ask people this question: (1) have your heard of LES or Loyc trees and (2) if you had heard about them, would you have considered using them (e.g. to make prototyping easier, or to separate the syntax of your language from its semantics)? Why or why not?</p>

I was saying that the editor presented in the video is confusing, and that a separate, predictable way of visualizing the data store wold help ameliorate that problem. For example, any time the user sees data that looks somehow "wrong", the user needs to be able to figure out whether it is wrong because (A) the data is actually wrong in the database or (B) a concept is misconfigured or something else, like, they're looking at a different record than they thought they were. If the database is invisible, the user will have a harder time understanding what's going on.</p>

Others include:</p>
<ul><li>Elastic tabstops (makes proportional fonts more usable in code)</li><li>respecting the local whitespace style when inserting newlines (i.e. if I press enter and the previous line starts with 2 tabs followed by 8 spaces, the new line should start with 2 tabs followed by 8 spaces)</li><li>highlighting definitions differently than usages, e.g. the "x" in "int x" might have an outline around it while the "x" in "x++" would not. As another example, there should be a horizontal line across the editor above every top-level function and class, so that it is easier to see where each new function/class begins. Also, when scrolling down into a large class/function, keep the class/function header visible on the top line of the editor so I can always see at a glance what context I am in</li><li>using colors primarily to categorize instead of just representing syntax - e.g. different colors for standard library functions, functions in our Backend API, and functions in the Frontend API. Scratch figured this one out. Multiple categorizations I can switch between with hotkeys might be useful.</li><li>Allowing emojis/symbols to be attached to specific entities of interest so it is easier to see at a glance when one of those entities is being used, e.g. attach ‚ù¶ to Console.WriteLine so it "jumps out" at me more. Alternately, could use symbols to abbreviate long-winded code, e.g. hiding Console.WriteLine and showing ‚ù¶ in its place.</li><li>Defining language keywords that attach to statements and cause them to be highlighted/enlarged or dimmed/shrunk in the editor. Often certain "key" parts of a function or class are worth highlighting, and other parts that are pure incidental complexity (e.g. writing a log message or verifying a security flag) and there should be a way to emphasize one and de-emphasize the other.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div></div></div><div id="2021-01-07T05:56:18.426Z" class="post"><span class="user"></span> <a href="#2021-01-07T05:56:18.426Z" class="date">üï∞Ô∏è 2021-01-07 05:56:18</a> <div class="message"><p>...</p>

<p>What I'd like to know more about is how your spreadsheet-lie UI maps to tree notation. It's something I look at from time to time, and every time I have the impression of seeing something very important and not quite seeing why it matters. So a real-life example like this would be nice to see explained in more detail.</p>

There are of course many ways to encode a 2D array as a tree, but I have the impression that this is not what you have in mind. It looks like you want to do the opposite: use a 2D array interface to define general tree structures. But I see neither how to do this, nor why it is interesting.</p>

<p>I would say at this stage of the game the 2-D/3-D aspect is</p>
<p>important for the UI of programming. It's like WYSIWYG of</p>
<p>programming.</p>
<p>In Tree, scope has a semantic meaning but also a geometric</p>
<p>meaning‚Äîif things are down and to the right, they belong</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>In Tree, there aren't infinite ways to write a list. There's</p>
<p>just one, and it's the way you would do it in the real</p>
<p>world: put items next to each other.</p>
<p>The languages follow constraints imposed by geometry. While</p>
<p>this may seem like it would limit creativity, in fact I've</p>
<p>found the opposite. By letting you focus on signal, and</p>
<p>removing all noise, you can focus on the semantics, and</p>
<p>really simplify your code to its essence.</p>
<p>There are also lots more you can do when you break out of</p>
<p>1-dimensional, linearly parsed languages. Tree Notation is a</p>
<p>subset of Grid Notation. There are other 2-D notations</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>An example might help. Would be easier to do a visual</p>
<p>but could try to put it into words. Imagine a project</p>
<p>wouldn't be a folder with a bunch of files, but instead one</p>
<p>file that you would open with a spreadsheet like IDE. and</p>
<p>edit like a canvas. What you'd normally put into files you</p>
<p>would instead drop an "anchor" in some cell in the sheet,</p>
<p>and start typing. That would be a root tree. And you could</p>
<p>have many of them throughout the canvas, instead of 1 file.</p>
<p>This is a good structure for languages for simulation. There</p>
<p>are some things like this, but none of them (AFAIK) have</p>
<p>ever made the layout and code isomorphic, and when you do</p>
<p>that you don't give up anything, and you make parsing and</p>
<p>tool building a lot easier.</p>

Something I always wanted in tools like this was to indicate styles - bold, italic, <code>code</code> - in some way, e.g. pitch change, background hum. And some way to indicate punctuation, in a different way from words - like, on the screen I see <code>Enum.FooFlag | otherFlag</code> but it shouldn't be spoken quite like <code>enum foo flag other flag</code> or <code>enum dot foo flag vertical bar other flag</code></p>

<p>But OTOH maybe you've just got a big AI model trained directly on source text and it doesn't actually know or care about the tree structure of the code?</p>
<p>Mind you an input module for Python doesn't actually exist, I'm just saying that in principle it looks like a good fit... what do you think?</p>

Our tool is for Python at the moment. But in principle, it can be extended easily to other Languages. I did not know of about Loyc tree. Thanks for the pointers. I had studied two system trying to build the similar functions. One is the (now-defunct) Babelfish (I could not find anymore the original website, but I found this one - <a href="https://dpordomingo.gitbook.io/community-edition/usage/bblfsh"></a><a href="https://dpordomingo.gitbook.io/community-edition/usage/bblfsh">https://dpordomingo.gitbook.io/community-edition/usage/bblfsh</a>) and tree-sitter (<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/"></a><a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/</a>) docly internally depends on tree-sitter via the open source library tree-hugger (<a href="https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-hugger"></a><a href="https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-hugger">https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-hugger</a>). The last one was also created and open sourced by us (Codist)</p>

<pre><code>ANTLR v4 is the result of a minor detour (twenty-five years) I took in graduate school. I guess I'm going to have to change my motto slightly.

Why program by hand in five days what you can spend twenty-five years of your life automating?

ANTLR v4 is exactly what I want in a parser generator, so I can finally get back to the problem I was originally trying to solve in the 1980s.

Now, if I could just remember what that was.</code></pre><p><a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf"></a><a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf">http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf</a></p>
<p>I wonder how this resonates with people on this community.</p>
<p>On the one hand I love building tools, but in the other, there are so many apps I want to build... I don't necessarily want to spend a lot of time building a "generalized problem solver" for each instance of the problem I want to solve.</p>
<p>As seen in ANTLR example, building a general tool can take years.</p>
<p>OTOH I'm grateful of all people that have spent so much time in building amazing tools like ANTLR.</p>

The piece that I got stuck on was I wanted clients/interfaces to be remixable in a straightforward way (which would be possible without considerable programming, since the backing data was all in the same DUSDL thing).

They have a bunch of graphical components. Spotify has a player, a list of playlists and a pane that shows the activity of my friends. Why can't I drag the player into my slack app? Even just controlling the exact same data? Just somewhere else on the screen? If we could do this, then the obvious next demand is to repurpose graphical components for other uses. Why can't I use slack's channel list to show my spotify playlists? The ability to recombine and repurpose graphical components is what I'm talking about. I think that this sort of functionality would free end users to meaningfully build their own software.</p>

Like, a super flexible QT app that you can split and remix into purpose-built apps. There would be a plugin system to add new graphical components (or ideally, they'd all be plugins). The issue I hit was that such a plugin system would make two many assumptions about how we ought to drive graphical components. It would naturally be limited to a few programming languages, or at best accessible through an ffi. I feel it would be a step backwards in a way, as currently, I can run a collection of graphical applications written in virtually any programming language. This is what I mean by heterogeneity. I'm not locked into a particular framework.</p>

A display server that makes composition happen at the process level. Like, one process is driving the playlist pane, and another is driving the player pane, and a top level process is orchestrating all of it. But this seems like a lot to take on.</p>

I'd simply say that when we design technologies our early choices constrain our later choices. In this case Internet Explorer thwarted web standards for about a decade, creating a Flash-shaped space awaiting the right combination of random factors. (Which turned out to be pretty random indeed--Flash being the team-up of a prodigy who would ship three historically-important graphics apps before the age of thirty and an Olympic pistol shooter with high tech literacy and a lot of investment income.)</p>

The design prof retired, the community college moved to a separate campus, Mozilla stopped funding processing.js, and it doesn't seem like the art and design schools universally embraced p5.js as its logical successor.</p>

Bringing things back to Flash--more than any particular features, I think it was the continuity of tool use in a community that made it special, persisting for about fifteen years. In York's case, I wonder what an additional decade of experimentation with a single framework--a time spanning three full cohorts of undergraduates--might have brought.</p>

<p>I've long said/ranted that we programmers pretend we're an industry when we're really just a cottage industry. Behind this sentiment was the unspoken assumption that industrialization may one day happen, and that at the appropriate time it would be good. But now I wonder if it's even a desirable goal to aim for. Does the ability to build at scale really need to be practiced at scale? Perhaps certain things are harmed by scale.</p>

<p>The key point is that it is fairly easy for the programmer to anticipate when memory will be freed and then immediately refused, allowing for code that effectively mutates memory in place.</p>
<p>For example if you say;</p>
<pre><code>X = f(10)

Y = f(X)

</code></pre><p>Then you know (assuming it fits) that Y will take the place of X in memory.</p>

And it's clear to the programmer where any cycles could be: in the mutable references. Very cool paper!</p>

<ul><li>Smalltalk: debugger OK (but could be improved)</li><li>Python: a bit primitive in the base language, but OK with a GUI layer on top of it. But could be improved quite a bit.</li><li>Everything else: frustrating.

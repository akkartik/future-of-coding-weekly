<div id="2020-12-29T17:28:57.173Z" class="post"><span class="user">Tim Lipp</span> <a href="#2020-12-29T17:28:57.173Z" class="date">2020-12-29 17:28:57</a> <div class="message"><p>I'm in the process of creating a proposal for a large grant, and facing a technical/philosophical question which I must credit FoC for opening my eyes to. Would ye oracles of the future of coding be willing to chime in on some of the technical aspects? It's for a non-profit that has the capacity to do a lot of practical good in the present world.</p>
<p>The grant is for a "digital transformation" of civil society in my province in Canada. The non-profit I'm building the proposal for is an organization that supports and financially audits over 150 community associations, representing over 20,000 volunteers and close to 1 million neighbours. My city is unique in the sense that a portion of our municipal operations are done by these distributed volunteer associations. As a rule however, these associations are very inefficient from a technological standpoint. Many of their workflows are done manually via paper.</p>
<p>My question is this. Do you think that the world of low-code/no-code solutions has become accessible enough for me to create a series of micro-grants for individual volunteer groups to do their own digital transformation? Or should I simply push all these associations through a unilateral transformation programme (like buying them all Google suite)?</p>
<p>I am biased towards creating a series of competitions around specific workflows that need to be digitized, and using the grant funds to fund prizes. I've worked with close to 30 civic-tech volunteers over the last year with some success, taking that approach. However, it has some risks of longevity. Perhaps it would be wiser to just take off-the-shelf solutions.</p>
<p>Yet I see this (perhaps simplistically), as an invitation by a government body to rethink the society and technology interact. If we talk about how we wish the economics around coding was different, this strikes me as a practical opportunity to build an alternative model. When it comes to the long-lasting design of what that technology looks like, I'm out of my depth. What do you think?</p>

Their data isn't currently inside a computer system, and they need a change to their working practices before it is.</p>
<p>In my experience, "top down" digital transformations are not popular with practitioners, because the vast majority of the cost of the transformation is borne by them, and the vast majority of the benefit is realised by others. It might be the case that paper workflows actually work well for the associations, in some sense, even if they are nightmare for the auditing non-profit.</p>
<p>I would focus on solutions that meet the people where they are. Humans shouldn't have to move to accommodate computers.</p>
<p>In practical terms, I would buy all the associations sheet-fed scanners that just pump anything scanned to the central auditors, then run your competitions in the frame of providing solutions that build on that messy data source. For example, they can provide an Elasticsearch front end that lets the associations query back over their data (that has been OCRed and parsed).</p>
<p>In terms of truly non-technical people building apps with the same ease they can currently design paper workflows - no, I don't believe the technology is there yet.</p>

Especially to be wary of a "top down" approach, perhaps I can temper some of the proposal-idealism by calling a few associations and hearting what their pain points are. I already had one reach out to me (part of what started this), but I don't think my understanding of the pain point is quite complete.</p>
<p>I'm still wondering if there is an opportunity for some kind of hackathon, because these are already operating as volunteer organizations. Since many elements of digital transformation are one-time, it could be a good fit for the time-bound nature of competitions, as long as the incentive structures are developed correctly.</p>

Languages change, codebases change, but data and APIs live forever. My two cents, use the grant to make an extendable API to expose all necessary data and actions. Once that's up, then you can definitely make micro-grants to let people use the API to solve their problems.</p>
<p>To make something particularly long lasting, focus on doing everything with standards rather than particular tech, like HTTP, REST, JSON, and SQL.</p>

The way I'm seeing it evolve now is perhaps taking an iterative approach to do just that. Round one will be very mundane using off-the-shelf solutions, round two will be focused more on the data and how it interacts, and round three could become more of the focused API creation using the boringest languages. But if the customers are really happy with just round one, I'll leave it open to the possibility of stopping the project there.</p>
<p>I did something similar with my last project where we started with a simple jotform survey, built a more advanced version in bubble, and then created the opportunity for a custom app, But ultimately the market told us that wasn't needed.</p>

See for example <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Large-scale-Pure-OO-Irish-Government/?itm_source=presentations_about_Naked_Objects&amp;itm_medium=link&amp;itm_campaign=Naked_Objects"></a><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Large-scale-Pure-OO-Irish-Government/?itm_source=presentations_about_Naked_Objects&amp;itm_medium=link&amp;itm_campaign=Naked_Objects">https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Large-scale-Pure-OO-Irish-Government/?itm_source=presentations_about_Naked_Objects&amp;itm_medium=link&amp;itm_campaign=Naked_Objects</a>. It is a completely different way of looking at the automation (you're not automating the process, your automating the tools to allow people to do their work). I'm really a big fan of Richard's work. Don't let the awkward naming or weird user interface fool you. The power is having tools that help people instead of hinder them (because of fixed processes, rigid rules, etc).</p>

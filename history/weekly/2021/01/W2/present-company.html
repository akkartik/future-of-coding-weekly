<div id="2020-12-29T17:28:57.173Z" class="post"><span class="user">Tim Lipp</span> <a href="#2020-12-29T17:28:57.173Z" class="date">üï∞Ô∏è 2020-12-29 17:28:57</a> <div class="message"><p>I'm in the process of creating a proposal for a large grant, and facing a technical/philosophical question which I must credit FoC for opening my eyes to. Would ye oracles of the future of coding be willing to chime in on some of the technical aspects? It's for a non-profit that has the capacity to do a lot of practical good in the present world.</p>
<p>The grant is for a "digital transformation" of civil society in my province in Canada. The non-profit I'm building the proposal for is an organization that supports and financially audits over 150 community associations, representing over 20,000 volunteers and close to 1 million neighbours. My city is unique in the sense that a portion of our municipal operations are done by these distributed volunteer associations. As a rule however, these associations are very inefficient from a technological standpoint. Many of their workflows are done manually via paper.</p>
<p>My question is this. Do you think that the world of low-code/no-code solutions has become accessible enough for me to create a series of micro-grants for individual volunteer groups to do their own digital transformation? Or should I simply push all these associations through a unilateral transformation programme (like buying them all Google suite)?</p>
<p>I am biased towards creating a series of competitions around specific workflows that need to be digitized, and using the grant funds to fund prizes. I've worked with close to 30 civic-tech volunteers over the last year with some success, taking that approach. However, it has some risks of longevity. Perhaps it would be wiser to just take off-the-shelf solutions.</p>
<p>Yet I see this (perhaps simplistically), as an invitation by a government body to rethink the society and technology interact. If we talk about how we wish the economics around coding was different, this strikes me as a practical opportunity to build an alternative model. When it comes to the long-lasting design of what that technology looks like, I'm out of my depth. What do you think?</p>

If two people change the same piece/region of data asynchronously, they did so with the intent of giving the data a certain shape/property/meaning. To offer ‚Äúautomatic conflict resolution‚Äù is to offer ‚Äúmerger of meaning‚Äù which is never going to be solvable via a generic algorithm. What is the problem that CRDT libraries claim to be solving? What is an example CRDT that an app has actually used that doesn‚Äôt employ a trivial resolution algorithm? You‚Äôre always going to need to encode domain-specific knowledge in any non-trivial resolution algorithm, to ensure the resolution captures user intent.</p>

<p>I'd love to know what some of the tradeoffs with CRDTs are. I'm happy to go with OT, too. I don't care too much about the particular algorithms involved, no more than other implementation details like what the API surface is like, how mature the library is, how many active users it has, etc. I'm just saying "CRDT" since that's a term in common parlance.</p>

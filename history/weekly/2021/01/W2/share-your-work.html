Your ethos of "no-code isn't powerful enough" and "you still have to think like a developer" come through and resonate. Your value prop of eliminating boilerplate is clear. I had a strong feeling it was Rails behind the scenes before you said so. The first idea I wanted to steal was your auto-generated custom API docs. Very nice. My reaction to "Twilio and SendGrid connections with more coming" was: consider <a href="http://autocode.com"></a><a href="http://autocode.com">http://autocode.com</a> instead of recreating all those connectors. As a developer, Gadget's design aesthetic feels fun, but my impression as potential customer of Gadget is: this isn't "serious" enough and feels like a toy. A font change could make the stuffed shirts be more comfortable with it. I asked myself fairly early on: why (other than Gadget's business model) is this a hosted service? It seems like 90% of the value is created in the initial app creation with a lower value prop in the ongoing maintenance, all-the-while feeling locked in. Why can't this be a code-generating wizard that I then take away to host and maintain myself? What's the benefit to me of keeping the project in Gadget long term? Finally, the demo itself shows the construction of an app that actually could be built well in a tool like <a href="http://retool.com"></a><a href="http://retool.com">http://retool.com</a> or something where the kind of customization you allow isn't necessary. It seems like a more compelling demo would include customization that less flexible tools wouldn't allow. (I know it's a lot to pack into 10 minutes üôÇ). I'm inspired by the innovative work you're doing and wish you lots of success. Cheers!</p>

I like thinking about the idea maze in the neighborhood of what you call features. Stuff like AOP[1], FOP[2], Literate programming. You choose to make features run-time entities and therefore immutable, and as a result the namespace of features will get polluted over time. The way I program I mostly care about decomposing programs for comprehension rather than deployment, and so I allow features to be modified: <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers</a>.

<ul><li>Returning immediately when the named result is assigned to is an interesting idea I've never considered before. Do you plan to support multiple named results? I'd played with this idea in my project[1] which is a lot more imperative/low-level/parsimonious. But I eventually reverted to a more conventional <code>return</code> keyword just so I could easily detect code paths that failed to return all results. I'm curious if you consider multiple results to be too difficult in a pure functional context.</li></ul><ul><li>I like the free syntax for declaring functions. It'll be interesting to see how you go about parsing function calls. Inform 7[2] may have some insights, if you aren't already aware of it.</li></ul><ul><li>The combination of array polymorphism with your other features is most interesting. Particularly live coding support. I'm not an expert on APL and its descendants, all the way down to Gilad Bracha's ShapeRank[3].</li></ul><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu"></a><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a></p>

Fundamentally, any hierarachy of structures containing only numbers should be convertable to and from an N-D tensor. Really need to pick a problem to throw at it and see what comes out.</p>

However there are parts of features (such as names, or function-structure) that can be changed without changing their semantics - there was a cool language project I saw which stored everything as structural hashes, rather than text names - so for example, one could modify an existing feature to add an intervention point to override, without breaking it.</p>

<p>"results are named, and assignment of the result terminates the function" it sounds like you're breaking tradition in a confusing unhelpful way. There is an established tradition called <code>return</code> for terminating a function, whereas assigning to named results (a la Visual Basic) should not terminate the function. Personally I would like both mechanisms to be available.</p>
<p>That one can define an "inner" function that isn't inner (is directly accessible outside the outer function - are you saying that it is accessible unqualified?) - this doesn't seem like a bad feature to me per se, but this behavior should be something the programmer asks for, not implicit.</p>
<p>Ordinary functions cannot accept arrays? How is this not a crippling restriction? Is this a limitation of GPUs (I haven't programmed any before)? If so how do GPU programmers work around it? I can't imagine how to write a compiler that processes arbitrary syntax/semantic trees on a GPU. Do you know how to write the zero language in itself?</p>
<p>"a task is a pair of values; one is being read from (the 'current' value) and the other is being written to" Why isn't it a queue, or an LMAX disruptor or something?</p>

I honestly don't know if this scheme is workable at all for real projects - that's kind of why I'm building it, to find out. My thoughts are that it can be made to work, because : 1) usually when I want to modify a program, I'll be able to narrow my focus down to the feature that causes the behaviour I want to change, and its ancestors/descendants, leaving all other code out of consideration; in my metaphor above, that means zeroing in on the one sticky plaster that matters, understanding how it works, and adding another sticky plaster 2) I can imagine optimisations where we detect 'dead code' (that can no longer run) and get rid of it / archive it / something like that; 3) something clever that we'll invent when we run into the need for it ?</p>

Actually those are borrowed from the first language I ever programmed in, BBC BASIC - they're pronounced "string", so i$ would be "i-string". I hit on that as the character to use because it felt like the right thing, but I'm not especially wedded to that specific character. "int i$" means "a task that generates a stream of int over multiple frames" ('frames' =&gt; clock ticks or whatever - that's not fully elucidated in the document yet). For the moment you can think of them as generators. I'm also not crazy about the "&lt;&lt;" but I've yet to think of something better. Open to suggestions.</p>

It's actually a response to the huge mess in C++ over their recent move semantics - I wanted to break from the idea that there is an implicit stack and we're copying things around, and make it feel more like "writing results to a variable that already exists", the way we do in assembly language, or "term rewriting", where the intent is more like "when you see this pattern, replace it with this pattern". Also, in most C++ code I write, I invariably end up declaring a named variable eg "result" and then going "return result" at the end. So this just makes that cleaner. I also like that it lets me use very similar notation for functions and tasks, with just the operator (= or &lt;&lt;) changing.  I definitely take your point that it is different, but for the moment I'm giving myself permission to break tradition wherever it feels right !</p>

<pre><code>// now I'm going to do something with (x)

statement1(x);

statement2(x);

statement3(x);</code></pre><p>and then later on I think "wow, I should really make that into a function", but I'm too busy and lazy and whatever, and it's a pain in the arse, so I don't do it. Or, worse, I do it, and now the code (statement1-3) is somewhere else, and to understand what's happening I have to jump to another bit of code, and it's just ... klunky.

    statement1(x)

    statement2(x)

    statement3(x)</code></pre><p>It's definitely a weird / quirky / controversial thing to do, but actually once you start writing code like that, it feels natural - you're not breaking flow all the time to create functions, you just create them and use them in the same breath.</p>

How is this not a crippling restriction?" - yes, definitely, this one is an eyebrow-raiser. Functions are defined as "operations on values of rank 0 only".</p>
<p>The motivation is that (combined with array variable names having to end with square brackets) it gives us a very clean syntax for map and reduce operations; so I can look at</p>
<pre><code>c = a + b</code></pre><p>and know immediately that this is a singular operation, because c, a and b are singular values; I don't have to go back and see where they were declared to figure out what their array-rank is (which is a constant source of confusion for me in numpy, C++, etc). Conversely, when I see</p>
<pre><code>c[] = a[] + b[]</code></pre><p>I know immediately that it's a mapping operation, because I know "+" only takes singular values.</p>
<p>The reason this isn't crippling is that structure properties can be arrays, so I can "smuggle" an array into a function by wrapping it in a structure; but crucially, this manoeuvre forces me to specify semantics. So, for instance, if I have an array of vertices and I want to perform some operation on them, I have to wrap them into another structure (eg. Mesh) and now they are properly typed, so I know what's going on.</p>
<p>What's not good about this (apart from it being super weird compared to all existing languages, which as you may have guessed by now isn't my major concern üòâ) is that I'm still unsure how to specify actual array-modifying operations like concatenation, slicing, and so on. I've got a few ideas, of course.</p>

This came from the graphics thing of "front buffer and back buffer", the idea that one value is being read while the other is being written, and they swap over at a specific and precise time, even if the computation of the new value is slow, or happens earlier, or both. In fact, under the hood, most of the time we can optimise that away, if there are no concurrent reads happening; and then for things like lexers we can imagine wanting to look forward or backwards in time, so yeah, a queue or another structure under the hood is a great idea. I just haven't got to that part yet !</p>

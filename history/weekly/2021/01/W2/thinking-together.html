<p>Here is the funny thing(according to me), it is a (somewhat) vicious circle.</p>
<p>Big Company with money -&gt; Can train big model -&gt; Can put hundreds of dollars in compute and marketing alike -&gt; Can bring media, money, attention -&gt; Bigger company -&gt; Can train bigger model...</p>
<p>Rinse and Repeat.</p>
<p>At least that is how I see it. And for that really important topics, such as Neuro Symbolic (or otherwise) models which can become really data efficient, Ethics in AI, Explainability and Interpretability, Alternative computing models for intelligence (apart form RL) etc. are never really surfacing. The reason being the circle I mentioned above.</p>

<p>The basic lifecycle of a "driver" is essentially:</p>
<ul><li>Driver describes Service registration requirements: Announce what registration info (keys, permissions, web-hook URLs, etc) it needs to register</li><li>User adds Service: Register an instance of Service X by providing "registration info" that were asked for by the driver</li><li>Driver describes Service interfaces: Use "registration info" to imperatively declare its interfaces (I have these functions, that take these types, that provide these representations, etc)</li><li>User can begin using this Service from their own code.</li></ul><p>This cycle exists to enable something like registering an Airtable database through a driver. We aim to allow for generative interface based on the Airtable's columns. You could just as easily replace "Airtable" as an example with an "SQL DB driver" even.</p>
<p>The main problem I'm wrestling with is mostly in how I would design the Driver SDK for step "3. Driver describes Service interfaces". In some respects, I want to allow the SDK developer (myself and my team members for now) to have a lot of flexibility with how they end up describing the Service interfaces &amp; provide that service interface's implementation. But, when it comes to considering how deployment, versioning, and development and debugging for SDK dev I feel quite naive.</p>
<p>Does anyone have reference material or admirable examples of this kind of problem? Even things adjacent could be very inspiring.</p>

The API is going to be different depending on the registration info provided? The registration info is provided programmatically (by client software) and you want the client to be able to compute the resultant API’s type/interface so static checking can be performed? If so, it sounds like your language needs a specially-crafted type system. The next step would be to show some examples of the types you want to be computed for specific registration info (inputs).</p>

You've got the right idea, here. The type-system we've designed has several distinguishing properties that make it better for our privacy-focused, semi-structured, editor.</p>
<p>For example, the projection of any type is separate from the type's "registration ID".</p>

The organization of files is definitely something to be covered in a future post. I'm currently thinking that a flat hash-based file store would be a good foundation on which other interesting things like tags or hierarchies could be implemented. </p>
<p>Before that though, I'd like to figure the "distributed" part out. That's the next step for me</p>

<p>One missing axis here is incrementality of backups. Time machine saves only differences with the previous backup. In addition to efficiency, incremental backups eliminate accidental deletion. And they can be layered on your 3 categories using tools like duplicity or borgbackup. Services like <a href="http://rsync.net"></a><a href="http://rsync.net">http://rsync.net</a> and backblaze work particularly well with incremental backups.</p>
<p>One drawback of incremental backups or encryption is that it's easy to get into a state where you need to download gigabytes of data just to access one file. It seems worth explicitly stating that in "universal access to data". It's implied by the words there, but won't be obvious to readers.</p>

Laptops, tablets and smartphones (which make up most of non-tech people's devices) aren't well suited for really persistent and safe data storage. Limitations are power-consumption, size / upgradability, availability, risk of loss, ...</p>
<p>I've been thinking about what I've been calling Personal / End-User Home Servers, which is probably very close to what you're describing. This would be a device that's as easy to set up as an Amazon Echo and serves as the central place where personal data / communication is handled.</p>
<p>This topic is definitely related. Ideally, it wouldn't be required though. I imagine a distributed system that'd also work without a "server". For example, I'd like to be able to use data sync &amp; replication when only having my smartphone and laptop connected. This would lower the barrier of entry (no need to buy and set up another device to get started) of the system, but you'd be able to improve capacity, availability, etc by connecting such a home server device.</p>

<p>I would consider incrementability (is that even a word?!) a performance optimization. Conceptually, it doesn't matter whether backups or updates are incremental or not, right? Accidental deletion can be prevented by keeping a history (which might be backup snapshots, file system journals, git, ...), but that's independent of incrementability. Incremental updates will become very important in the implementation though, that's right.</p>
<p>That's a good point! One option is to have the current state stored along with increments what contain the differences "going backwards". More recent versions (which are more likely to be accessed) are cheaper to get this way. I'm not sure, but I think git uses something like this internally.</p>

As someone trying to help non-techies (also called "family") manage their electronic data, I can only confirm that there is no good solution today.</p>
<p>One aspect I wonder about is the conflation of data storage, data syndication/synchronization, and backup. There are decent solutions to each aspect, but non for the combination, which is however exactly what matters for end users. It's perhaps the syndication'/synchronization aspect that is hardest to solve because it is inherently cross-platform and today's tech world is more oriented towards platform domination than cross-platform mediation.</p>

<p>That's right. I also noticed that I was mixing synchronization, storage and backup in the post during proofreading. It's pretty hard to distinguish these aspects though. Synchronizing data between devices (when done correctly) also serves as a backup and can improve data availability, regular backups give you history which is also part of many file systems, etc.. Thinking about these aspects from the start will probably lead to a simple solution that performs well on all use-cases.</p>
<p>Synchronization is indeed a tough problem. I hope that a simple data model and great UX will get me pretty far.</p>

I was thinking of using libp2p (which is for example powering IPFS), but hypercore looks interesting too. I'll check it out, thanks :-)</p>

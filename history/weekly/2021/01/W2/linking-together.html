And the churn rate from his recent patreon email is pretty high. I’m friends with Nicky Case but he’s not doing research per say, instead crowdfunding more real world things like explorables &amp; games (and also has a decent reach on social media).</p>
<p>Without an existing distribution channel, I don’t know how Dan would get the 6k needed to support his family</p>

There's a limited sense in which music is inherently open source. You can just listen to it and, with enough skill, recreate it. It does take a lot more skill and equipment than compiling an open source project, or even lifting a technique from said project, but I think it lifts some of the pressure that inclines software people towards total transparency. Closed source software hides things we really need to look at.</p>
<p>While I enjoy having free software all over the place, I can't see where Jonathan is wrong. You get what you inventivize. Neither "CEOs" (rather broad brush there, btw) nor open source's simulated annealing approach are going to get us where we want to be.</p>
<p>I don't have anything like an answer, but here's one random idea: different financial/openness regimes for different layers of the stack, as well as different stages of development. Open source is working pretty well for basic libraries, for instance. We should keep doing that.</p>

<p>On the first article, I don't see anything special about 1996. The "pre-1996" list includes LISP - a language from 1958! If we are allowed to reach 40 odd years in the past, then a lot of the 1996 list can be included in a 2020 list. It also oddly excludes C++ from the description; "useful incremental improvements on top of the foundational technologies that came before", despite it's name being a literal pun on incrementally improving C.</p>
<p>The second article, I don't really follow what type of organisation is expected to be producing groundbreaking research. Small software houses making UI widgets? From my understanding, most significant steps forward have come from monopolies, academia, or military. (this is where most of the 1996 list items came out of). He says research can't be done at a startup, so what research is actually being hindered by OSS?</p>
<p>I read a lot of what <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoda/">Jonathan Edwards</a> writes, but I can't follow a coherent line of reasoning here. Perhaps they are more just meant to stimulate debate 🤷</p>

<p>My understanding is that the low-hanging fruit is gone rather than there is a lack of creativity.

For example, the term "Open Source ideology" only applies to a small fundamentlist group of people, best exemplified by Richard Stallman, who however would loudly protest against the use of the term "Open Source" rather than "Free software".</p>
<p>There are various arguments for Open Source, and all of them are valid in some context, but don't adapt well to others. In my own domain, computational science, Open Source is increasingly seen as well aligned with how publicy funded research works, or should work. But that argument doesn't cover Linux, Firefox, or VSCode, to name a few well-known projects with very different social structures behind them.</p>
<p>I see two important aspects in the Open vs. Closed Source debate. <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoda/">Jonathan Edwards</a> addresses one of them: lack of incentives for significant innovation. The other one has been mentioned by <strong>@Andrew F</strong>: "Closed source software hides things we really need to look at." I don't think comparisons to music and other creative endeavors outside of technology are very useful in that debate. Technology is special because of its high impact on our lives ("...and then our tools shape us."). The opposition between Open and Closed Source is what has led us into a situation where we have to choose between performant tools and tools that respect our need for personal agency and privacy. My current view is that we can remove this contradiction only by accepting that technology is a political topic. Given that our tools shape us, we can't just leave their design to small interest groups, be they techno-elitists or anarchists.</p>

Yes we need a debate. We might actually need the ability to debate! What values should be expressed through our software? When OPen Source means a Liability towards maintaining a certain fixed developmental state , is this gaianing in resilience for society or losing it? What are the values we want to further and which we want to keep in check? Trying really to articulate, making the effort in creating distinctions in necessary IMO.</p>

And as you say, we probably don't even have the ability to organize that debate. None of the institutions of our societies seems to be able and willing to do it. Next question: can we get that debate going in a bottom-up fashion?</p>
<p>In parallel, we as technophiles can start thinking about technological middleways between all-open and complete opacity. One intermediate is audited code, examined by trusted specialists who report on its potential risks to the public. But can we make code auditable? Ensure that those trusted specialists can examine it with reasonable effort? Can we prevent the obfuscation of undesirable features by technical means? I'd love to see type system experts working on such questions.</p>

So, this is more topically related than a direct response. I've often been puzzled by how so much of the modern computing world was built by companies like xerox and bell, and how that doesn't seem to be happening in the same way now. But reading David Graeber's The Utopia of Rules over the break offered a pretty compelling explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>First of all, the amount of really innovative research being done in the private sector has actually declined since the heyday of Bell Labs and similar corporate research divisions in the fifties and sixties. Partly this is because of a change of tax regimes. The phone company was willing to invest so much of its profits in research because those profits were highly taxed—given the choice between sinking the money into higher wages for its workers (which bought loyalty) and research (which made sense to a company that was still locked in the old mind-set that said corporations were ultimately about making things, rather than making money), and having that same money simply appropriated by the government, the choice was obvious. After the changes in the seventies and eighties described in the introduction, all this changed. Corporate taxes were slashed. Executives, whose compensation now increasingly took the form of stock options, began not just paying the profits to investors in dividends, but using money that would otherwise be directed towards raises, hiring, or research budgets on stock buybacks, raising the values of the executives' portfolios but doing nothing to further productivity. In other words, tax cuts and financial reforms had almost precisely the opposite effect as their proponents claimed they would.</p>

I basically agree with the first one regarding the reduction in the speed of progress over the named period, and I certainly remember the change in tech culture after the Netscape IPO: it brought many MBA/Wall Street types into the industry and shifted the culture of the Valley from nerd concerns about doing cool things to greed-head concerns about getting rich.</p>
<p>My only disagreements, really, are: (a) that startups do sometimes manage to do research and ship new stuff, though that has become increasingly rare because of the aforementioned cultural factors (short runway/fail fast/MVP thinking); and (b) there's been a fair bit of interesting research over the intervening decades that mostly hasn't made any difference to end users--or even to most of the industry. For example, Racket's language-oriented programming stuff is great!</p>
<p>That said, there are other things that people rely on every day that are sort of invisible, like advances in distributed systems that have allowed reliability at scales that would have been hard to imagine in '96 and huge engineering improvements around non-parametric regression (which too many call "AI"), plus miniaturization and manufacturing improvements that allow all of us to carry around touchscreen supercomputers everywhere we go.</p>
<p>The second article is much more hit-or-miss. Many important pre-1996 improvements were done as open source projects. Some that I myself worked on include bind (DNS), sendmail (SMTP), converting EAY's open source SSL implementation to the still open source openssl in the context of the mod_ssl module for the open source web server Apache, the BSD kernel, and so on. Anyone reading this post probably used at least two of these technologies today, MacOS/iOS users have likely benefitted from all four.</p>
<p>There's definitely a cultural problem around how modern OSS work is funded.  The idea that individuals should fund the projects they use out of after tax salary while companies carry on building empire on the backs of OSS contributors is grotesque, and I'm still fairly bitter that I wasn't able to get Google to put any money (beyond Summer of Code projects) into improving emacs even though half their engineers were using it daily.</p>

The world is a multidimensional space and there is definitely a lot of "movement" even in the last 20-40 years. However it doesn't mean there has been movement along any axis that you care about. The note about 50 year old OSes and 30 year old text editors definitely resonates with me. "Scaling" is a word that gets mentioned a lot re the last 20 years. But our main ideas on scaling haven't fundamentally changed and I'd say the effort has been along "brute force" wrt software creation. What, 10 hand written lines of code don't do the trick? Lets like 10 billion by hand!! Moar libraries on top of moar libraries! Too hard to manage the stack of dependencies? No worries - moar package managers!! Etc.</p>
<p>Side note: I am amazed that at the fundamental hardware capability level there have been mind boggling advances. 4K displays, 5G, terabytes of affordable SSDs, etc. A lot of hard work has gone in to make that stuff happen.</p>

Are faster locomotives progress? What about going from coal-steam engine to diesel-steam? What about going from locomotives to airplanes? Yes they're all progress, but the last one seems different at a fundamental level. Brings very new possibilities, and new limitations. What if it was required that all invented modes of transport must stop at, start at, and follow the railway tracks only (compatibility!). How to invent airplanes in this world? This is the curious nature of software. It's not just objects, it is also the space within which these objects live, and much of that is entrenched.</p>

I don't know where he gets funding for his own research, but for me there is no funding.</p>
<p>First of all, I happen to be one of those that would prefer music and movies be as free as FOSS, because a economy based on artificial scarcity is bad in a world of impoverished people. But whatever, the current model for music/movies isn't that bad - those who can afford to pay usually pay, and those who can't, don't. I've lived in the Philippines so I've seen how this works - in practice it doesn't work too badly, as filmmakers get paid and poor people still get entertainment.</p>
<p>Programming languages is a totally different kettle of fish, where convincing people to use a new tool is already difficult. Why would you want to hinder adoption further by charging money for each copy? Why would you make a tool that OSS fans (myself included) are likely to refuse to use regardless of the merits? The Wolfram language is maybe the best example. It's an excellent tool with an huge library of useful tools, but you have to pay to use it and I think that's why it has gained very little mindshare among developers.</p>
<p>Open source suffers from quality issues for an obvious reason: people can only afford to do it in their free time, and almost no one is hiring teams to do open source software. But it does not follow that freedom or "free riding" is the problem.</p>
<p>Charging for each copy made far more sense before the computer era, and that's why we used that system. In the computer era it makes far more sense to shift to a public funding model where people doing PL research and open-source engineering can apply for grants or UBI or something.</p>
<p>I, for one, would gladly accept minimum wage to work on my PL research and open-source engineering. It sure beats the zero income I'm getting now. I once paid $300 for a compiler when I was a teenager - I had a paper route and could earn that money. But the paid model only worked because (1) there weren't good open source alternatives at the time and (2) I was buying a "proven" solution (a C++ compiler) which everybody was telling me was the best way to do software development (I eventually realized this wasn't true and now recognize C++ as a pretty shitty language). If your goal is to do experimental work and really challenge the status quo, how does the paid model work in 2021?</p>

My passion is software, not business. More importantly, it seems very clear that investors are rarely willing to invest in tooling, precisely because it is so hard to charge money for tools, and an ad-based model a la Google/Facebook doesn't work on the command line (one npm package publisher tried it and he got smacked down hard and fast). So why should we lust after the old-fashioned charge-per-copy model again?</p>

It's a combination of two things, both very well done: a computational infrastructure, and a huge library of machine-readable knowledge encoded using this infrastructure. Compare with Wikipedia, which is also a huge library of knowledge, but much less machine-readable (in spite of Wikidata, which is a great project), and in particular not executable (something that <strong>@Denny Vrandečić</strong> is working on). There have been many attempts to make an Open Source clone of Mathematica, which have all failed. Wikipedia is the model of open collaboration that everybody points to. So what's the essential difference?</p>
<p>My analysis: the Wolfram language is a top-down design with a genius in the dictator position (I don't use the term "genius" lightly, but Stephen Wolfram is one of the few people I consider derserving it). Wikipedia is a bottom-up effort to which everyone with minimal digital literacy can contribute. We'll get the Open Source equivalent of the Wolfram language when a large enough part of the population acquires sufficient digital literacy to be at ease working with executable knowledge and its strict semantics. Unless of course AI-based mediation makes Wikipedia knowledge robustly executable before that happens. My crystal ball isn't very clear on that question.</p>
<p>The problem with computing is the requirement of managing precise semantics over multiple level of abstraction. That's a rare competence today. Open Source projects work when they have enough people with that competence (called "maintainers") participating over long time spans, whatever their motivation may be. But maintainers can't adopt the right mindset for innovation. Stephen Wolfram can.</p>

My example was meant to illustrate why the bazaar model doesn't encourage technical innovation.</p>
<p>The legal and social perspectives of Open Source are orthgonal issues at first sight, but in practice, most Open Source projects rely on both the legal and the social part. One way to frame recent criticisms of Open Source, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoda/">Jonathan Edwards</a>'s as I understand it, is the lack (so far) of other social structures that can predictably and reliably produce software that is legally Open Source. In particular structures that are more compatible with innovation.</p>

Niklas Luhman has this idea of System Theory and Sociology , in which he says the following about structures and functions within societies: a function is needed in a society so a structure will emerge to support that function. So you always have to ask yourself, what can be a good balance between your needs and the needs of society. I do thikn the idea of a universal basic income could be a major driver for positive change in society. But there are many people in most societies who do not think this way.</p>

As such it is among the best I have seen, even better than its Smalltalk equivalent (a more standard exception system). But the overall debugging experience in Common Lisp is less pleasant, partly because of the information overload created by compiler verbosity (at least in SBCL, the only Common Lisp I have used seriously), and partly because of the large distance between the source code and the debugged compiled code for macro-intensive code.</p>
<p>One of my long-term but low-priority to-dos is to check out the demo versions of commercial Common Lisp systems to explore their debugging experience.</p>

<p>The key point is that it is fairly easy for the programmer to anticipate when memory will be freed and then immediately refused, allowing for code that effectively mutates memory in place.</p>
<p>For example if you say;</p>
<pre><code>X = f(10)

Y = f(X)

</code></pre><p>Then you know (assuming it fits) that Y will take the place of X in memory.</p>

<p>I don't think the problem is actually ownership or control (with a few regulatory exceptions in certain industries), it's more about trust.</p>
<p>the owernship/control/lock-in issue (as real as it is) is something that can be overcome. It's just a hard, long game of building trust which requires time, money and hard work.  I recall a lot more jokes and complaints from backend devs about how silly of an idea Heroku was (at launch) and that they wouldn't concede control for such little value.</p>
<p>A few years of building a brand, trust and filling in the missing features and I now see the same backend devs opting for Heroku on projects left and right, with no concerns around control.</p>

<p>The ideas of APL and its successors, the array programming languages, were two generations ahead of their time. These languages are based on the notion that everything is a tensor, and all operations are rank-polymorphic: they extend automatically to tensors of any rank. These ideas are perfectly suited to an era of machine learning, large scale data, GPUs and other accelerators. Building on recent academic research, we are building ShapeRank, a new statically typed, purely functional language for industrial use, that extends rank-polymorphism to streams. We’ll introduce the key ideas and show how they are realized in ShapeRank.</p>

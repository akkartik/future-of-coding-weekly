I settled on working in Roam for now but I can see myself going back to this idea some day soon. Over the last few months I've been just building small "experimental" interfaces like this that I think could eventually evolve into a single cohesive system (or be "spun out" as general concepts like this). I really should start doing two minute week posts though...</p>

The spec also helps a lot, but it also raises more questions. The <code>TreeNode</code> interface is clear enough as a building block for trees, but what about grids? I think that's the problem I have since the beginning: is a grid just an interpretation of a particular tree structure, as in the frequent representation of a 2D arrays as rows of 1D arrays? Or is a grid a distinct data structure from a tree? Put differently, in terms of syntax: is grid notation just syntactic sugar for a frequently used kind of tree, or syntax for a different data type? Again put differently: can a grid have semantics different from any tree-based semantics?</p>

Really helpful to see where the gaps are.</p>
<p>At the high level I view the big idea as "2-D Languages". (Well, 3-D</p>
<p>as well, but let's just limit ourselves to 2-D for the moment.)</p>
<p>I think of things all around me in the world as 2-D languages.</p>
<p>A Highway Sign for instance.</p>
<p>Once we get into the digital realm, with our current hardware</p>
<p>stack we do have to collapse things into 1-D, and that's</p>
<p>where "Grid Notation" and "Tree Notation" come in. Any document</p>
<p>could be parsed as either a Grid Structure or a Tree Structure. If</p>
<p>there are no nested nodes, then the structures would basically be the</p>
<p>same. If there are nested nodes, then in Tree Notation you would</p>
<p>parse child trees, whereas in Grid Notation the empty edge nodes</p>
<p>would just be parsed as empty cells. I rarely use pure "Grid Notation", but</p>
<p>I do sometimes use something in the middle, where sometimes I allow</p>
<p>nested trees and sometimes I don't. But really it's probably</p>
<p>better to just always use Tree Notation. Because even when I start a</p>
<p>lang small and think "I'm never going to need scopes with this</p>
<p>dumb config language", a few months later I'm always like "damn, scopes</p>
<p>would have been better and I shoudl have just used tree notation"</p>

<p>than helping to talk about "Grid Notation" and "Tree Notation".</p>
<p>I just thought there's a nice pattern at work here:</p>
<p>Add 1 special symbol and you get a 1-d "List notation" that supports lists of words.</p>
<p>Add 1 more special symbol and you get a 2-d "grid notation" that supports lists of lists of words.</p>
<p>Add 1 more special symbol and you get a 3-d "tree notation" that supports recursive lists of lists of lists of words.</p>

If OurWorldInData can't tell me, I don't know where else to turn!</p>
<p>Last time I read about "tree notation", it wasn't very compelling because you didn't explain some key things:</p>
<ul><li>If it's a "tree notation" then it should express trees, but instead it appears to be two dimensional, i.e. it expresses a grid, not a tree. If it's really a "tree notation" then how do you express a tree?</li><li>If the cells are space-delimited, how do you express a space character inside a cell?</li><li>How do you distinguish various data types from each other, e.g. how is the string 123 different from the number 123?</li></ul><p>Edit: apologies to the extent I repeated ground already covered above... by the way, I looked at the "Sandbox" but it doesn't help much to answer these questions because (1) it doesn't include samples (except one), (2) there seem to be substantially different interpretations of the same tree notation, hence three different JSON conversions, which isn't terribly enlightening, (3) there is no reverse conversion from JSON (or XML) to Tree Notation.</p>

<p>a new data TS/JS transformation</p>
<p>table lib under the hood so you can</p>
<p>do any kinds of data transformations</p>
<p>you want. We call it CoreTable</p>

<p>After we started that, Jeff Heer's lab</p>

<p>the node break/row break is always new line.</p>
<p>In the JTree lib the cell and edge symbols are a space.</p>
<p>But you can set those to whatever you want.</p>

The Loyc tree of <code>Foo(2+2)</code> is, of course, normally expressed simply as <code>Foo(2+2)</code> which is a call to Foo with one argument, and a call to <code>'+</code> with two arguments.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I sketched out something called BLES, which is a syntax for Loyc trees designed as an extension of JSON (and subset of LES2). In these grammar diagrams, the things BLES has in common with JSON are shown in black, while changes are shown in blue. It looks about twice as complex as JSON, but probably about one-quarter as complex as C. So this is something I could port to other languages more quickly than other versions of LES.

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote a little program that starts a VNC server for accessing its GUI. I didn‚Äôt need any third-party libraries because the protocol is so basic.

If Markdown had universally used [text][link], it would have been easier to remember ([text][id] is allowed where [id] refers to a link provided later in the document, but Markdown could have dealt with this ambiguity by assuming anything that contains a slash is a link, or by assuming that if no link is provided later on, the id itself is a link.)</p>

<p>I would say that the video would be easier to understand if I knew more about the basic principles of the system, like which laws of physics (if any) it follows, and what each component is capable of doing. And yeah, Chris's feedback is good.</p>
<p>In any case it's very cool that you can implement a sorting algorithm in this manner.</p>

<p>This feature would be useful both at the language level - one should be able to define a function together with synonyms (old and deprecated names together with merely alternate names) that map to the canonical name - and also at the IDE level, where machine learning or a simple thesaurus could find related names. Oh, and the IDE could also refer to the documentation for search results, and use API popularity to help choose the order of results.</p>

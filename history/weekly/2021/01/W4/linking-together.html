And if your idea doesn't involve making a profit or publishing a peer-reviewed academic paper whilst earning a PhD, most of your options disappear.</p>
<p>But often people with good ideas (as well as bad ideas, mind you) believe in something a lot but they don't know how to articulate the idea to others. So I would propose that if you've got an idea, you should be able to work on it, at least for some period of time, without first proving its merits in a grant application. You need only prove, somehow, that you are doing work and not playing video games or whatever.</p>
<p>It would probably work best if there is some minimum experience level (e.g. Master's degree or 2 years industry experience) so that the worker isn't clueless, and a sort of coach or mentor who is paid at market rate to facilitate - to make sure each worker is aware of prior art to avoid duplication, to connect workers with each other if they could logically work together, to provide moral support... and the fact that the pay is low should discourage participation of 'normal' people, who will invariably choose to work in industry instead. This is good - I don't expect much from normal people, and low pay implies more workers can share the same pile of cash.</p>
<p>But there's no way I can get Musk to read this. P.S. there's little reason to restrict the fund to software developers, but hardware engineers, chemists etc. presumably need extra money for equipment.</p>

<p>the presented Thoughts are inspiring, cool, disturbing and unsettling:</p>
<ul><li><p>We don't use technology as a Tool, but as an Environment, which we use to perceive other humans and our "real" environment/nature.</p>
<p>Such that we as humans only can function in this technology environment.</p>
<ul><li><p>We replace the perception of humans with machine related Terms and Algorithms. Not only do we treat machines like humans, but also humans like machines.</p>
</li><li><p>technology by itself has no agenda. Only the model of operation in which we use the technology created that directed influence.</p>
</li></ul><p>Most of the technologies today are used in a market oriented model with the goal to enable growth.</p>
</li></ul><p> All models of operation like markets, national states, education and science/academia are created by ourselves - so it follows that we are also able to change them again.</p>
<p> It is our Obligation as humans to ensure that all models of operations serve our well being</p>

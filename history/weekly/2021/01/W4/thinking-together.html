<p>This little thread is melting my mind: <a href="https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151"></a><a href="https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151">https://queer.af/@erincandescent/105562630364133151</a></p>
<p>My mindset for the past 5 years has been that UX = gradual teaching on demand = never lying to the end-user, which implies never telling big lies, only little white lies that are easy to push aside to learn more. But at the heart of everything I did is the big lie that I'm programming "a" single unitary computer.</p>
<p>I've always known about many little controllers in our computers, but my mind treated them as exceptions. I think society has this consensual hallucination that software runs "on top of" hardware. The past six months (starting from my old realizations about BIOS: <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1599112907014300</a>) have been a slow, painful journey to come to grips with this fact.</p>
<p>Bat signal to <strong>@Charlie</strong>; this is fodder for your old thread from May 2019 that most software is built across collections of computers. <strong>@Ian Bicking</strong> too had a post around the same time that messaging and communication are all, that decomposition is trivial, that focusing on "programming" is often a modernist approach. If we started from the assumption that "coding" is about orchestrating groups of computers, what would we do differently? What does the UX for programming look like if you also have to specify where computations happen? It seems to make Bret Victor's problem much harder. But following Alan Kay, perhaps we don't yet have the "hardest and most profound thing to then build every easier thing out of".</p>
<p>I'm also thinking about Dave Ackley's <a href="https://movablefeastmachine.org"></a><a href="https://movablefeastmachine.org">https://movablefeastmachine.org</a>. He started out in security, so he likely knew all this when he started out on his project. You can't secure your computing substrate if you aren't thinking about 90% of the computers in it.</p>
<p>Anyways, likely the fever dream will break in a day or two and I'll go back to lying to myself programming my little computer. But I thought I'd throw this out while it's fresh.</p>

I recall him writing somewhere that even by the late 70s he felt Smalltalk could be done better, and the official Smalltalks had reified too much of the interesting bits to be able to evolve.</p>

So you could imagine a VM that could customize the processor it was running on to optimize the way it ran, ie instead of JIT'ing the running of the VM, you reify the operations the VM needs to run efficiently down to the hardware level. From Kay:  "Another example: all the Parc personal computers of various kinds were microcoded, and in the latter 70s you could sit down to any of them to e.g. run Smalltalk, whose image would be sent from a server, and the machine type would select the special microcode for the Smalltalk VM on that machine."</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't know of any consumer hardware that will continue to run if say, its GPU just diesI have a direct counter example:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have two GPU's in my laptop, the one bundled with my CPU, and an "external" Nvidia card. The Nvidia card regularly has driver failures and my laptop falls back to the on die graphics card.</p>
<p>This is almost seamless, and very much a distributed system. OS kernels handle these kind of driver failures all the time, and they are conceptually very similar to a distributed database that experiences a network partition.</p>
<p>Some more extreme examples are Plan9 "everything is a file" and EMACS TRAMP. Both are examples of abstractions that cross both file system and network boundaries with similar semantics and error cases.</p>
<p>referring back to my earlier story about my National Science Foundation work, there was one group of grad students working on GPU's, and another group working on distributed graph algorithms on AWS. We were part of the same umbrella project, and regularly exchanged ideas about how to solve problems.</p>
<p>The constraints and failure cases are not wildly different at all imo.</p>

The thing is it's very rare that they have symmetrical capabilities, so if you have a work load that actually needs that Nvidia hardware and you switch to intel integrated graphics, you'll have a worse experience. A language with an actor model that abstracts heterogeneous hardware and treats it as a homogeneous distributed system won't really solve that</p>

I mean potentially there is an interesting abstraction of a "command buffer" (a circular ring buffer that could look a little bit like messages in actor model systems) and an actor could be an explicit piece of defined hardware that has specific capabilities (both fixed function and code) but programming models and capabilities of different hardware are different enough that I'm not sure how useful it would be</p>

Game engines also generally use command buffers to send commands to a render thread (running on another core on the CPU) to drive rendering on the GPU.  It works great when you are mostly pushing data/commands to another device, not so great for frequent two way communication though, because this pattern tends to be used in systems with high-throughput and high latency (relatively speaking, high latency for a GPU is still really low compared to an HTTP request)</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't believe it is particularly useful to equate heterogeneous computing with distributed computing and use the same abstractionsUsing the same abstraction does not mean requiring the same constraints.</p>

<p>And continuing with graphics as an example, things like feature flags for OpenGL are used all the time to provide different feature sets depending on hardware capability.</p>
<p>Similarly, Erlang and most actor models have ways to query the available resources for a particular process. Smalltalk has this as well.</p>

<p>The fact that I can still use my laptop if one of the GPU's fails seems pretty damn useful to me personally, even if the experience is degraded.</p>
<p>In the network case, variable bitrate video is also extremely interesting. If my network is suddenly over saturated or degraded, I used to not be able to play a video on Youtube at all, or my video call would be disconnected.</p>
<p>With variable bitrate streaming, the quality is simply lowered.... Same abstraction, that has built in semantics for heterogenous capabilities (dynamically changing capability btw)</p>

<p>Maybe the issue is this all handled at OS level, should be to implement the OS in a different way rather than try to abstract over all OS APIs?Microkernels are the best practical example I can think of that try to do exactly this: <a href="http://www.microkernel.info"></a><a href="http://www.microkernel.info">http://www.microkernel.info</a></p>

I'm not sure if this is a novel insight or not, but there seems to be some form of equivalence between reading/writing code textually vs with blocks/shapes and the equivalence of algebra/geometry.
There are many proofs and problems that seem to lend themselves to geometry over algebra but there are also situations that being able to reason about something algebraically makes it substantially simpler. I think this is the situation where you need both and it's possible at certain levels of abstraction you would want to be able to easily shift back and forth. For example I could imagine a system that had components built in a textual representation but then the component linking all done utilizing shapes.</p>

<ul><li>When did you have to deal with corrupted files and what was causing the corruption?</li><li>How did the corruption look like (single swapped bits, part of the file missing, ...)? My current line of thought is that small errors in binary files could simply be corrected by adding redundency to the format (crc etc.) and larger missing parts wouldn't be easy to recover from in text formats as well. Therefore the argument wouldn't make much sense. I'm curious what you might have experienced as I can't remember to have seen corrupted files in the last couple of years.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2021-01-20T18:22:00.060Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Denny Vrandeƒçiƒá</span> <a href="#2021-01-20T18:22:00.060Z" class="date">2021-01-20 18:22:00</a> <div class="message"><p>I saw corrupted files frequently, mostly when they are coming from the network and were cut in the middle, or when a stream wasn't working well, but also as part of memory dumps where some parts of the memory was written over etc.</p>

When a human reads a file, they can eyeball it to see if it looks corrupt, make a guess at what it should have looked like, and manually patch it. With binary files, usually your parser just barfs. All the recovery steps a human performs have to be programmed in.</p>
<p>As to the actual question, the only time I can remember personally was from downloading ISOs: s couple of them failed their hash check and had to be re-downloaded. Bad disk dismounts are the other classic case, with a broader category of bad disk write/flush handling that can leave a file in weird states (<a href="https://danluu.com/file-consistency/"></a><a href="https://danluu.com/file-consistency/">https://danluu.com/file-consistency/</a>).

<p>For programs that write serialized output, a corrupted file is usually just truncated. That is usuallyl recoverable. But when working on large binary files, random-access modification is quite frequent and can result in just about any mistake.</p>

If there's an incorrect byte, the corruption is limited to at most two characters. In binary encodings, a single error (e.g. in a length field) can corrupt everything that follows.</p>
<p>But you're right, text files are basically a subset of binary files and all advantages they have could also be achieved in other (non-text) formats.</p>

My thoughts on the Dynamicland system: The focus is on the objects and how they can interact and be understood, rather than the current implementation of code or the ‚Äúpapers and dots‚Äù Augmented Reality system.</p>
<p>Important points not related to the code or RealTalk implementation:</p>
<ul><li>Always on. Key to making the system more casual.</li><li>1-to-1 relation between seeing an object in the world and it having influence on the world. This is key to understandability.</li><li>Use affordances of physical objects, rather than trying to solve them in code. The tangibility is important here, but using physical objects can also reduce the scope of what code has to do. For example, your code becomes simpler if you don‚Äôt have to worry about fitting modals, tabs, and substates into a single screen if you can separate them across many papers/programs. This also includes using the spatial relation of programs to influence control flow.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-01-22T18:20:34.012Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jacob Haip</span> <a href="#2021-01-22T18:20:34.012Z" class="date">2021-01-22 18:20:34</a> <div class="message"><p>That being said, there are some interesting things on the technical side that support the physical side:</p>
<ul><li>Shared tuplespace is a good fit for ideas that are ‚Äúthe size of a room‚Äù. Data is pretty small and doesn‚Äôt need to run ‚Äúat production scale‚Äù so it can be kept simpler and more understandable.</li><li>Pub/sub like system using ‚Äúclaim‚Äù/‚Äúwish‚Äù + ‚Äúwhen X‚Äù is a nice and simple way for programs to communicate.</li><li>- The system bootstrapping itself is also interesting. There are a lot of AR-desk demos but being able to edit the system without having to switch back to a traditional computer GUI is cool.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-01-22T18:30:35.012Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Cole Lawrence</span> <a href="#2021-01-22T18:30:35.012Z" class="date">2021-01-22 18:30:35</a> <div class="message"><p><strong>@Jacob Haip</strong> programmable.space has a lot of really cool ideas in it.

Most of my disappointment was with implementation, which is maybe the wrong thing to critique in a research environment, but it's still something that matters.  Specifically the overall latency of the system was disappointing, it was challenging to code or interact with any programs that felt immediate.  When I was there they said latency would be addressed, but it's also a hard problem given the implementation of the system.  The other thing I didn't like so much was that claim\wish\when system wasn't well utilized in most of the tables they had in the space.  That is, usually a single page or two felt like a self contained application, and the dream of a loosely coupled dynamic play space that required little coding to compose interesting and useful behaviors wasn't realized.  There's no reason I could see that they couldn't support it, and some of the debugging tools gave a glimpse of that, but it was really hard to pick up a random page from one table, bring it across that space and have it do something interesting (or at all) with other pages.  Designing a semi-shared set of common claims (outside of system level ones to access lower level drawing, audio, etc. functionality) would have made it more interesting I think.</p>
<p>My favorite demos were things that worked around these limitations and also showed something that would be tedious to do outside of the environment.  Like the demo where you could draw multiple sketches and have them automatically animated on another page.  Latency didn't matter, because you got much more immediate feedback than if you did this with a camera or a scanner in a traditional computing environment.  Another one I liked was a simple book (like the equivalent of a CD album booklet) where you could turn the page and play different songs, with text with the song and artist name. In some ways the projector system might be a good visual equivalent to an audio home assistant (Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.)  I really wanted to see more, here are a bunch of building block pages, compose them however you like.  I think back to Nicky Cases concept for visual programming (below) in Dynamicland, and although I don't think I just want that, the actual act of programming in dynamicland was writing lua scripts on an extremely text laggy editor, with poor error\compile feedback, and I would have liked to build things with the same ease and in the same natural way as interacting with some of the demos</p>

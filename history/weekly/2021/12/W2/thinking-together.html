I was inspired by the deadlock RPG game thing. This is very much a "Type 1 FoC" solution in that it's purpose is make current programming practice more understandable. It basically brings more people up to the point of a genius coder. Most of Learnable Programming is like this.</p>
<p>A Type 2 project would be something like these Actor Model systems that try and come at computation from a completely different place where things like deadlocks don't exist. I think that Dynamicland and maybe Hest is this type.</p>
<p>A third type would be the low-code/app builder type projects which just try and help people get to solutions as directly as possible.</p>
<p>So I would categorise projects based on how they deal with the fundamentally difficult points about programming at the moment;</p>

<p>One of the big things most of us seem to agree on is that programming should be more accessible to people lower technical skill (not sure about everyone else but I see this as overlapping the goal of reducing accidental complexity).</p>
<p>Another common undercurrent is the sort of political goal of keeping computation more under the control of device owners than corporations, et al. I'm sure there's a better way to phrase this....</p>

By default a conversation is a random walk, not a survey. If you were really disciplined, you might be able to come up with a curated list of subject headings, maybe outline an agenda for a much larger discussion, but even that would be tricky. To say nothing of the logistical synchronization issues others mentioned... I think we can do better async.

I largely agree with the philosophy, but at the same time find some unease with it. </p>
<p>I guess I want to have this conversation, but I also don't want to be super negative. </p>
<p>Clojure is a fantastic set of tradeoffs that makes for a super productive programming environment. But I do worry that there is a lot of talk from rich that this model of programming is the only good one. That is something I think needs more push back in the clojure world. </p>
<p>I think languages have something to learn from clojure. But clojure could learn a lot from other languages as well.</p>

<p>Any static web page as well as every dynamic UI in the browser or anywhere, can be seen as an orthogonal combination of <code>embodiment</code> and <code>essential state</code>. Let‚Äôs call such a combination a <code>layer</code>.  (Think of state  the <code>values</code> and embodiment as <code>rendering</code>/<code>timers</code>/<code>event-handlers</code> etc).</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the problem it is aimed for solving: State composes perfectly with state, embodiment composes perfectly with embodiment; but when we mix state and embodiment, complexity explodes exponentially; we can no more distinguish between them, no more extract and model the state explicitly, visualize it, generate tests based on it etc and for every new part or feature, technical debt is amassed and the complexity quickly skyrockets into levels that not even the most skilled designers and developers can handle.</p>
<p>So back to the really simple idea: Let‚Äôs keep it orthogonal; let components be expressed in an orthogonal way, let‚Äôs composition propagate orthogonality.</p>
<p>What follows from it? How can we model it; can we being to imagine a <code>Layer Machine</code> formalism? A <code>layer machine markup language</code>? Make an enlightening<code> run-time visualization</code>? Can we implement it, and in how many LOC?; can we use it to explore its PL usability factors along some cognitive dimensions? What new ideas can we form based on that experience?</p>

In my experience, state composes awkwardly ("oh, it depends on this other data way over there"), embodiment composes awkwardly ("oh, that isn't going to fit on the screen"), and the two, when mixed, compose even worse ("wait, I was in the middle of editing that, it can't just disappear when make a change that will remove it from the list").</p>

I‚Äôll keep that in mind next time. Do you think a brief summary and a link to a blog post w code examples would be more helpful? Anyways, what I mean with <code>state</code>is just a tree of pure values, like in <code>statecharts</code> , and, yes the embodiment can be DOM, concrete UI etc. In stead of Layer machine, just read <code>state machine</code> or <code>statechart</code> and assume a composable version of them that covers the whole app instead of leaving a lot to the host language. And in stead of layer machine markup, think HTML, just extended with some new kinds of tags or metatags. I think explicit state modeling as in e.g. statecharts is so great for keeping complexity at bay, and that the biggest thing stopping it from being even more useful is composability; thus I find anything that might enhance composability of statecharts/state modeling super exciting! Hope to do a better job of exiting people for that idea the next time! üôÇ</p>

And the third is just right: reusable pieces that snap together tightly using minimal glue.</p>
<p>I have a short list of concrete examples, not my own:</p>
<ul><li>Bayes rule composes well when you use odds instead of probabilities.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko</a></li><li>Maxwell's equations fall out from the geometric product in the proper units.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8</a></li><li>The chain rule composes better under derivatives improved by keeping the function's original value too.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17gfCTnw6uE"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17gfCTnw6uE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17gfCTnw6uE</a></li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-12-10T15:49:07.211Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Henning Sato von Rosen</span> <a href="#2021-12-10T15:49:07.211Z" class="date">2021-12-10 15:49:07</a> <div class="message"><p><a href="http://github.com/andrewf">Andrew F</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/NickSmit_">Nick Smith</a> Thanks for feedback, and my bad for posting raw ideas of the top of my head and omitting definitions/intuitions üôÇ  I‚Äôll keep that in mind next time; doesn‚Äôt hur to work on my communication skills üôÇ  Do you think a couple of descriptive sentences and a link to a blog post w code examples would be more helpful? Anyways, what I mean with <code>state</code>is just a tree of pure values, like in <code>statecharts</code> , and, yes the embodiment can be DOM, concrete UI etc. In stead of Layer machine, just read <code>state machine</code> or <code>statechart</code> and assume a composable version of them that covers the whole app instead of leaving a lot to the host language. I think explicit state modeling as in e.g. statecharts is so great for keeping complexity at bay, and that the biggest thing stopping it from being even more useful is composability; thus I find anything that can enhance composability of statecharts is super interesting.</p>

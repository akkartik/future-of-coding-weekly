I'm most interested in feedback on whether they make sense from a communication standpoint, but also which parts of them sound feasible (there are a few, even ones not marked "stretch", that I have a feeling will not be possible). If nothing else, maybe they inspire you, contrast interestingly with your own goals, or whatever. I've just pulled out the very high-level philosophical goals from my list, plus some terminology that I use weirdly. The full doc has a lot of technical ideas, but it's still, um, raw. I'm not sure about what I linked here but the rest definitely reads more like an insane screed.</p>

It might be useful to identify such pairs as lines of tension.</p>
<p>Example: "good defaults" vs. "don't hide things from the user". Unless all defaults are always visible (e.g. pre-filled entry fields). using a default effectively hides the existence of a choice from the user.</p>

You should be able to inspect your defaults, even if you don't feel like changing them. Somewhere down the line there's probably "see how this thing was generated" UI operation that you can use on generated content of all kinds, including defaults, materialized views, etc.</p>
<p>Would it be better to say something like, the information should be possible to access by some reasonably short and predictable route (depending on how obscure the info is), not that it needs to be on display all the time?</p>

In the end it all depends on the number of default values. One or two are easy to handle. Ten are a UX challenge, but doable. When you reach a thousand, the mere number makes it impossible to make them easily accessible. You need to sort them by relevance, which is already a judgement that developer and user may not agree about.</p>
<p>This is an essential feature of computing, which philosophers label as "epistemic opacity". Once an information system has features that exceed the cognitive capacity of an individual, new rules apply.</p>

But before too long you've zoomed in far enough that the defaults and specific preferences are just data with no particular relationship, and the defaults/visibility tension is no longer even well-defined. Honestly, any way of finding out what an app is thinking that's more accessible than hooking up a debugger is an improvement on the state of the art.</p>

<p>I would fare better at commenting on narrower, more concrete goals for a particular project, especially a language design project.</p>

<p>The intended context is that these are the first section of a longer text document that gets progressively more concrete and detailed, going from these philosophical goals to (very much WIP) technical ones, with each layer referring to previous ones for justification (chain of reasoning is important, because some of them get pretty weird). That would be where most of the meat is, and maybe I've been assuming that those will serve as examples that clarify the very abstract parts. So I'm reluctant to make this part longer. Maybe one of those side-by-side formats would be good with examples and explanations off to the right?</p>
<p>With what I've given you, maybe it's enough that people aren't actively confused on what I'm even saying. Like I said up front, this is primarily an exercise in whether I can convey the ideas at all. I've historically had trouble putting them into words at all. I know it's a little weird using this slack as basically a writing critique group, by that's where I am right now. :) </p>
<p>I almost posted, and still might, an even more abstract question about what even can serve as justification for, e.g., one set of data modeling primitives over another.</p>

If that OS existed today in a way that was interoperable with the rest of the world I would have to consider shelling out serious money for it.</p>
<p>I'm realizing I have a hole in my definitions of intent as written in bits and platonic intent. The practical upshot is that I want to write my intents as if in terms of a non-physical platonic intent (and don't want to get into the philosophical question of whether that's meaningful when all/most of our intents arise in the real world :D). Certainly, programs written that way (exceptions for low level code) should be independent of any particular encoding of the things on which they operate.</p>

Slack can be a bit ephemeral, so is there a way of surfacing and curating info for longer? <strong>@Orion Reed</strong> suggested using emjoi reactions as a signal to direct a slack bot.</p>
<p>I see this same problem in the Observable community where the best notebooks get lost after they fall off the /trending page. People are individually curating "amazing notebooks" collections but individuals run out of impetus at some point so the efforts are patchy.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about solving this for the Observablehq community for a while. Some kind of system to submit URLs to notebooks and a way of tagging them -&gt; leaderboard with voting dynamics. Its basically reddit but scoped to a single domain. I do not have a good handle on the details though, how to incentivize long term content (vs reddit which is very churny)</p>
<p>Anybody got any other ideas or inspirations. Community curation seems like a common problem. Is there a solution? Does someone want to give me direction on what they would like to see?</p>

<p>I see ncatlab has some kind of topic cross linking which is helpful for exploring and discovery.</p>
<p>n-category cafe doesn't have anything, on my initial look it doesn't seem to be particularly discoverable, am I missing something?</p>
<p>In the observable world  notebook is the unit of content (which is very close to a blog post). In FoC a slack thread is the unit of content.</p>
<p>In ncatlab, articles are wiki and can share space with the index, which is super great for zooming around for discovery. Hmmm, maybe thats an important feature of wikis and something to carry over?</p>

I am pondering the following way to perceive orthogonality in HSM‚Äôs. Traditionally we would look at is as the typical concrete representation invites: <code>{ a: { b: { c: ... } }, d: ..., e: ...}</code> .  So I consider the idea that this is more concrete  than it need be philosophically. Here is an attack: Let‚Äôs define two operators: <code>&amp;</code> for combining values into and-states, and <code>:</code> for combining values into hierarchies. Then we write <code>a:b:c  &amp; d &amp; e</code> . Traditionally, the CS practitioner and programmer would ask for precedence rules or brackets to disambiguate the expression:</p>
<p> <code>{(a:b:c), d, e}</code> or  <code>{a:(b:c) , d , e }</code> . Here is the point where an alternative orthogonal model might be possible and might be valuable from a language-design point-of-view: In stead of nesting we lay out the values in a two-dimensional grid, e.g. drawing the  <code>&amp;</code> relation horizontally, and the <code>:</code> vertically upwards. Then, a noteworthy thing can be observed: The <code>a</code> value is now both an element in the and-state (horizontal relation) and the first element in the hierarchy (vertical relation). This is my criteria for detecting of orthogonality, as I meant it in the OP.</p>
<p>Wow thanks!, it was kind of cool to actually write it down. </p>
<p>Follow-up question: So, while this evidently is drawable; does it map well to cognition, implementation? Is it view-point in the eye of the beholder, or does it open up them HSM model for e.g. generalization/deeper understanding?</p>

So thats useful, and in practice the paxos protocol is a runner for state machines, so they are used in technical domains for real (not sure about flavour of state machiens though, maybe not HSM).</p>
<p>I also see them in realtime systems (<a href="https://www.state-machine.com/"></a><a href="https://www.state-machine.com/">https://www.state-machine.com/</a>) again, coz they are complex enough to be useful, but simple enough to really figure out and trace symbolically.</p>
<p>The QP frameworks people make a strong argument that HSM is necessary to avoid the state space explosion problem that basic state machines suffer from. This is directly because of the orthogonality. When you can express things as two orthogonal basis vectors you avoid having to flatten them into their non orthogonal space (the cross product). So yeah, I would say orthogonality has made state machine scale to the realtime systems domain. Of course, HSM are still less expressive than turing machines so they clearly are not used much when we have access to higher level languages and want to move fast and break things.</p>

<p>Is this not satisfied any time the stuff nested under a is fully contained inside it?</p>
<p>I'm having trouble seeing this as anything other than a syntactic change. Nesting is still going to crop up in the semantics, or at least, it will cause a lot more trouble to get rid of it than you could possibly benefit from. Syntax should clearly express that.</p>
<p>I do think things that don't explicitly depend on each other should be allowed to be going independent. For instance, finding all the natural concurrency in a program. I don't know if this is exactly what you're saying, but I think it's related.</p>
<p>Somewhat aside: I've come to think of nesting and sequencing as being different sides of the same concept, namely dependency. I think this is supported by the way nesting-based encodings of sequences, like linked lists and fixed points, keep cropping up.</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[November 1st, 2021 5:04 PM] dalton: A thought that‚Äôs been crystallizing for me is that the essence of ‚Äòcoding‚Äô is <em>modeling &amp;amp; simulation</em> (not e.g. data and functions). These themes show up all the time in FoC contexts, but as far as I can tell they‚Äôre rarely the ROOT metaphors of a system.</p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of examples in ‚Äúreal engineering,‚Äù what Alan Kay refers to as CAD&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;SIM-&amp;gt;FAB system. Do you know of examples of ‚Äòconvivial computing‚Äô projects where modeling and simulation are the main event, or readings on the topic? What do you think of this premise?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a recent &lt;<a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-Alan-Kay-see-any-new-ideas-in-computing|Quora">https://www.quora.com/Does-Alan-Kay-see-any-new-ideas-in-computing|Quora</a> answer&gt; for more context: <em>Does Alan Kay see any new ideas in computing?</em>
&amp;gt; ‚ÄúNew‚Äù is not what I look for. ‚ÄúIdeas that make a qualitative difference over past techniques‚Äù are what I‚Äôd like to see.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Years ago, I‚Äôm fairly sure I was aware of pretty much everything regarding computing that was going on in the world. Today, I‚Äôm definitely not aware of everything, so it‚Äôs reasonably likely that if there was something really great being done somewhere that I wouldn‚Äôt know about it.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I would be most interested in learning about ‚Äúqualitatively more expressive‚Äù programming that is more in line with top-level engineering practices of the CAD&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;SIM-&amp;gt;FAB systems found in serious engineering of large complex systems in the physical worlds of civil, electrical, automotive, aeronautical, biological, etc. engineering.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; In the CAD&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;SIM part I‚Äôd like to see the designs understandable at the level of visualizable semantic requirements and specifications that can be automatically simulated (on supercomputers if necessary) in real-time, and then safely optimized in various ways for many targets.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Isolating semantics in the CAD&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;SIM part implies that what is represented here is a felicitous combination of ‚Äúcompact and understandable‚Äù.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The FAB-part pragmatics are very interesting in their own right, and besides efficiencies, should be able to deal with enormous scaling and various kinds of latencies and errors, etc.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The above would be the minimal visions and goals that I think systems designers within computing and software engineering should be aiming for.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I‚Äôm not aware of something like this being worked on at present, but these days this could be just because I haven‚Äôt come across it.</p>
<p>[December 15th, 2021 2:41 PM] skadamat: The core unique idea to computing really feels like ‚Äúsimulation‚Äù. Personal Simulation? Even though the ‚Äòquantified self‚Äô movement didn‚Äôt really take off, there was a bit of a personal end-user empowerment angle which was neat. :thinking_face:</p>

<p>I have a central concept of simulation in a different sense, like having a fine-grained hierarchy of (often very domain-specific) language interpreters, running programs in a hermetic sandbox, and other Turing-flavored simulation things. :D (It's an outrage that sandboxing software is so hard in practice when simulation is so foundational to computing.) I'm probably still missing some nuance on the model-centric perspective of simulation, but I bet they can be unified.</p>

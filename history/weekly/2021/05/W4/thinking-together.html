<p>The NeXT version had the editor because NeXT made it easy to add one, other plaforms didn't so nobody made the effort and a browser was "good enough". We may push the blame one level below: If other platforms made it easier to embed an editor then the browser ports would have it.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs the notion of designing something only as far as you need to, which I‚Äôve been exploring as one of the main themes in Christopher Alexander‚Äôs work. Ryan Singer calls it ‚Äúdesign latitude‚Äù. It‚Äôs what pattern languages really are about: describing a design only as far as you need to in that context, leaving all the lower-level implementation details as open as possible.</p>
<p>In software we nowadays default to spell everything out as detailed as possible. Partly because we have to; that CPU isn‚Äôt going to do anything until you present it with some proper stream of instructions, so you‚Äôre required to fill in all the blanks somehow, even if you haven‚Äôt figured those out in the design yet. Or ‚Äî what a concept ‚Äî if you‚Äôd prefer not to fill these details in, but leave it to others downstream to do that.</p>
<p>Being able to distinguish the decisions that you need to make now from the ones you want to leave open, is something our tools today are really bad at helping us with. They usually push us towards deciding everything, even if we don‚Äôt want to.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know enough about that to judge whether I perhaps mean a different kind of incomplete. Alexander is pretty clever in pattern languages, where he uses ambiguity of language to choose words that create the right picture in our mind‚Äôs eye, but such that we (the ‚Äúuser‚Äù) fill in the blanks and not him (the designer). It feels like there‚Äôs a (subtle?) difference there in that an incomplete specification misses something completely (or chooses to leave it out), whereas a pattern language very deliberately describes something, but in a way that is intentionally ambiguous. I‚Äôm having a hard time squaring precision of specifications with ambiguity.</p>

More specifically, equations are constraints on the solutions. You can compose as many such constraints as you want.

I didn't mean to say "we can do bidi links already" but rather "bidi links can be extracted, with some effort, from uni directional links" and perhaps this idea can be used to build curated lists.</p>
<p>One big shortcoming of the web is there is no link-content stability. The link represents a way to get the content, not the content itself. A unique link should always give you the "same thing". In some cases this might mean the latest version of that thing, but prior versions should be linked to the latest one as well. OTOH, the original author of some content should not be required to fund availability of their stable content on some server for perpetuity.</p>
<p>Perhaps we want a system where authors publish stable content links but availability is provided by other organizations. For large globally relevant content, large publicly funded organizations could fund availability (~wikipedia). However smaller communities could form their own organizations and fund availability of content relevant to and curated by them. As things become more relevant, content would get pinned into the zones of more and more orgs, small and large. As they become less relevant, many orgs might stop persisting the content, but archival orgs like newspapers and <a href="http://archive.org"></a><a href="http://archive.org">http://archive.org</a> might take them on. I believe IPFS (and maybe DAT?) or something similar can be a foundation of what I am describing.</p>
<p>This is only part of the problem though. In IPFS for instance, a link will give me a blob of bytes but making sense of it is still left to me. What's the guarantee I'll be able to assemble the perfect combination of programs that extract meaning from that blob? In 5 years? In 50 years? How can we enrich the system to do this easily and reliably?</p>

There is no way to ensure persistence, nor erasure of information.</p>
<p>Content-addressing as in IPFS (not DAT, which is based on UUIDs for sharing mutable data) is a very useful ingredient for better information management. Preserving the semantics of data is a much harder problem, one that people (including myself) are actively working on in the context of preserving digital scientific knowledge. 5 years is doable today. If you aim for 50 years, there are techniques that make it possible under reasonable assumptions, such as the continued existence of virtual x86 machines.</p>

<p>For the short term, something like mime type tagging can work, but a mime type is just a string tag. If a blob is annotated with <code>image/png</code> we're likely to find decoders easily. However it gets harder for <code>text/some-custom-format</code>. So instead of a string tag, what if we tag a file A with a link to another permanent file B which we call the class for file A. The B file would describe how to parse the content of the A. But how do we know how to parse B? Either it is well known, or it would link to another class file C, perhaps. At some point we have to agree on a small language to describe the axiomatic description <code>B*</code>  that all classes eventually link up to. The main thing would be these descriptions would have to be machine agnostic (no x86 specific stuff). However, as an optimization these class descriptions would also link to x86 implementations (stored in other files) of the parsers. So if you're running on architecture X, you could find the class for the content (A -&gt; B) and then lookup implementations for X (B --(X)--&gt; F). Parsers for future architectures could be added. Also, content files can be reencoded into instances of newer classes, if needed.</p>

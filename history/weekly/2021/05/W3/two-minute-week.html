<p>Once the card is configured it can generate a more descriptive name, setting it manually takes time and the title is almost always a description of the card's configuration.</p>
<p>Auto title will generate the title from the configuration when the user Ctrl + Double Clicks on the card title.</p>

<p>Where is the data persisted? What is the output - web or desktop app? How do you see it used - by non-developers, developers, in combination with Excel, for personal Vs bigger projects? Or maybe better question is - what is the big vision?</p>

<p>Currently no data is persisted but in the future I'll store everything in a relational database. The output is a web app. My target audience are non programmers. The aspiration is that you can eventually build any application that fits a relational data model. Initially the feature set is still very limited so a more realistic Intermediate goal would be to build basic crud applications with for prototyping or in cases where you cannot afford a developer to build a fully featured application. In my next prototype I  want to explore how to add simple interactions beyond linking between pages.  Techologywise I'm using Javascript with Preat.</p>

It has formal grammar definition, implementation suggestions and more! Crazy, I can't remember last time I was so positively shocked ðŸ˜„!

<p>Very niche app, but that's one of the points of Meemoo. I have to remind myself that it's still chugging along after all these years, and useful for these niche problems.</p>

<p>(You have to increment the <code>frame</code> input manually from 0-15, and then press "play" or "make gif" in the "animation" box.)</p>

I tried to optimize for sending every change through the graph, but that means that things like this need some kind of gate to open and close. That's a common pattern in Puredata, which I was using for some projects while making Meemoo.)</p>

<blockquote><p>üê¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/@forresto">Forrest O.</a>: A 2 pixel horizontal slice of each frame of video becomes 2 rows of pixels in the output image. There isn't an app for this (probably) but I built one in Meemoo, a webapp for media manipulation and animation. <a href="https://app.meemoo.org/#gist/df73db87de2117a311f7b8d10297af69">https://app.meemoo.org/#gist/df73db87de2117a311f7b8d10297af69</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Other services for learning code (like Code Academy) start with ‚Äúthis is a var.‚Äù You complete the lessons, get badges, and maybe get a fundamental concept of programming, but what can you really do with it? Meemoo starts with ‚Äúthis is a stop motion application.‚Äù Use it as is, or look under the hood and hack it if you like. I think that this design for hackability feeds curiosity and encourages learning in a more natural way, much closer to how I and many other actually learned coding.</p>

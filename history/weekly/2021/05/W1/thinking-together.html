<p>This is certainly possible, though there are some very real challenges!</p>
<ul><li>a bootstrap problem, if you care about links between different domains then it's always going to be incomplete, period, and it's probably going to miss the one important link you're looking for unless you're indexing most of the web. Indexing most of the web is quite expensive!

<p>In a practical sense you can probably get close because of how much tracking there is in the real internet. I would look into Google Analytics API for that. Or you could try some heuristic like the following Google search; <code>"</code><a href="http://futureofcoding.org"></a><a href="http://futureofcoding.org">http://futureofcoding.org</a><code>" -</code><a href="site:futureofcoding.org">site:futureofcoding.org</a> which searches for a URL, excluding from that domain itself.</p>

The one I know is Pharo. It has a class <code>SmalltalkImage</code>, which might look like what you are looking for, but it's really an entry point to access low-level system information. It's not an object that you could archive or send around. "The image" is not an object, it's the set of all objects. Better avoid Russel's paradox by not having the image be an element of itself!</p>
<p>However, you can do things that come very close to what you describe. For example, you can ask class <code>Object</code> for all instances of itself and its subclasses, and send those around the world. That's all objects in the system, including their classes. You might run into resource limits trying to send them from one image to another, I didn't try. If you want to play with this, I suggest Fuel (<a href="https://github.com/theseion/Fuel"></a><a href="https://github.com/theseion/Fuel">https://github.com/theseion/Fuel</a>) as the most adequate serialization framework for large sets of objects.</p>

So far we've managed with <code>Marshal.dump</code> and <code>Marshal.load</code>.  Classic Ruby dark side: quicker, easier, more seductive.  Dump to file, send to somebody else.  Is this unsound?  Absolutely!  But for a decade plus it's only occasionally been a problem: when dumps get into the 100s of MB.  A rewrite some years back to use a database like a normal Rails shop failed, so I may try something different.  Would have tried already if we weren't living in the end-times.</p>

The VM is probably often the element responsible for reading the image and creating the actual Objects (including Class, CompiledMethod, Context, etc) and continue execution where it left of when being saved.</p>
<p>That said, it would definitely be possible to see it as an Object. A Smalltalk implementation could even run (simulate?) the environment inside a supplied image. Do remember that things like garbage collection are often (must often) be done by the VM. So simulation is not trivial and might require quite a few extra features in the ‘receiving’ Smalltalk image.

<blockquote><p>the thin/fat client pendulum is changing direction againThere's a bit of a split going on I think. The "cool kids" zeitgeist seems to be going the other direction (e.g. Ink&amp;Switch), both for privacy and performance reasons. I recently moved house and go better internet (70mbps) and tried out Stadia and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and the performance still isn't there IMO, the ping is very noticeable. Maybe once cloud compute infrastructure is common in every town, like a post office. If you live next to an AWS datacentre, then yeah I'm sure the calculus is very different.</p>

The M1 has obliterated any need I would have for it in my day to day, however in my data science work I have an insatiable appetite for more power in the browser. I can envision use cases where I'd love to have browser tabs with 1TB of RAM running sims and then just duplicate the tab and change some params and run another sim. In my work on Ohayo and Our World in Data we are not even close to .1% of where data science could be in the browser. A big limitation is the specs of client machines. This could in theory make those caps adjustable and so I'm very long term bullish on it, if that's one of the directions they support</p>

But I don't understand how this is a good idea, since CPU and memory are very cheap and I currently have 73 tabs open without a problem. Maybe we should instead look at why a web email client requires 250M of RAM, when I recall an 8M machine was considered pretty high-end and could run a more full-featured email client with only a fraction of that memory.</p>

Unlike a game (thinking of Stadia here), where you have a lot of full screen motion with complex transformations, a browser is mostly static images (free to predict), occasional scrolling (typically a large chunk of the screen moving the same direction and distance, trivial to predict), and infrequent whole-screen changes when loading a new frame (prediction is outside the scope of the codec). Modern codecs like h264/h265 handle the first two with aplomb.</p>

Smalltalk systems (except for GNU Smalltalk) and the Lisp machines have rich tools as part of the system, making them accessible to modification and extension from the inside. Emacs is almost the dual, putting the tool aspect first. Most other Lisps rely on external tooling, while not excluding the possibility of adding it to the inside (e.g. CLIM for Common Lisp, DrRacket for Racket).</p>

I’ve noticed over time that I’m an extremely visual programmer. However, most current attempts at visual programming are bad and or incomplete IMO. Something that might be nearer our current abilities and practicality would be creating a really stupid simple toolkit that allows the interfaces of code to be played with. e.g. some namespace that filters a user list could be like this:</p>
<pre><code>(defn all-users [...] ...)

(defn filter-users [user-list fname-partial lname-partial] ...) 



-------------------------------------

|       ----------        ---------  |

| fname |         | lname |        | |

|       ----------        ---------  |

| user-list                          |

| ...                                |

| ...                                |

-------------------------------------</code></pre><p>Basically, bootstrap some simple ui (preferably where the ui design isn’t controlled by the programmer - time sink &amp; barrier to entry) that demonstrates the function live. There would need to be multiple different kinds for different interface types, and probably domain specific ui would need to be developed per project. The primary reason I think for this kind of UI would be for discoverability and getting a high level understanding of codebases.</p>
<p>Stupid? Crazy? Already tried? I’m aware of GT and have followed it a bit, and that seems like the closest match. I think this is a slightly different idea, though correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

But, the idea of moldable development is really that there is no single perspective about anything in a software system. Code and objects all should invite different perspectives, and most of those perspectives will be for reading only, without necessarily providing any editing capabilities. And, when we bring it to its natural conclusion, we do end up with highly specific experiences for each system parts.</p>

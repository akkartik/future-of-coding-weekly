<p>I might qualify. I'm the CTO of&nbsp;<a href="http://nanopay.net"></a><a href="http://nanopay.net">http://nanopay.net</a>, which won the Canadian Blockchain Company of the Year award in 2019. However, we aren't actually a cryptocurrency company. We use blockchain technology to digitize fiat currencies (or other assets) so that they can be used to make payments more quickly and at a lower cost. I can certainly see the original appeal of cryptocurrencies, which was to make transactions easier. The complexity of making a fully legal and compliant payment is far greater than you probably realize, with various regional know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money-laundering (AML), terrorist, compromised persons, sanctioned industry and other watchlists. As well, as the burden of suspicious transaction reporting and fraud mitigation. A simpler way to transaction would certainly be appealing, however, most cryptocurrencies just ignore these laws, making them technically illegal, as far as I can tell (but I'm not a lawyer). However, since the initial use-case, I think the whole cryptocurrency phenomenon has changed to be more of a tool for speculation/gambling/ponzi-scheming.</p>

The only difference is that the database would still load data from the database, so if you could corrupt the database then you might be still able to make off with the money, even if the logs were tamper resistant. In our system the audit logs are the database, so it isn't possible for the database and the audit log to get out of sync. Audit logs help figure out what happened after the fact, but often, that may be too late. Also, I'm not aware of any database which has sufficiently advanced access control mechanisms to fully implement the kinds of access controls that we have/require (not just ACLs, but also limits, structuring, AML, KYC, sanctions, risk exposure, maker/checker, compliance document expiry, etc.) We store all of these rules in the blockchain as well, so that they are as tamper resistant as the transactions themselves. When crypto-exchanges are broken into, it is never the crypto that is broken, but instead the surrounding infrastructure and meta-data, but we store everything in the blockchain, which helps to avoid that problem.</p>

As I've said, I think systems like bitcoin are technically illegal. Bitcoin isn't ideal because of the high energy costs, low transaction rate, and high latency. But those issues could be addressed with a different architecture. We are still distributed for reasons of fault-tolerance and high-performance, but yes, that's not the same as something like bitcoin. We're geographically distributed, but not organizationally distributed. Our target customer is organizations like central banks or governments.</p>

Based on the source and destination locations of money, and possibly also on any countries the money travels through on its way. It can be more specific than country. Take for example marijuana which is legal is some US states, but still illegal federally. National banks and credit card companies are prohibited from processing transactions related to marijuana purchases, but state banks aren't. I don't see governments' desires to combat tax evasion, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, terrorist financing, etc. abating anytime soon, and as such, I don't see them clearing all of the related laws from their books.  If anything, I see things going the other way. As an example, I saw this article in the news yesterday about cracking down on people buying expensive watches with cash: <a href="https://usa.watchpro.com/prosecutors-crack-down-on-retailers-selling-rolex-watches-for-cash/"></a><a href="https://usa.watchpro.com/prosecutors-crack-down-on-retailers-selling-rolex-watches-for-cash/">https://usa.watchpro.com/prosecutors-crack-down-on-retailers-selling-rolex-watches-for-cash/</a>.

<blockquote><p>I'm curious about your company, Nanopay. How does its tamper-resistance &amp; security compare to databases with strong access control &amp; audit logs? <strong>@Kevin Greer</strong> replied:</p>
<p>If your audit logs are cryptographically signed by some kind of notarization service, then they are almost the same. The only difference is that the database would still load data from the database, so if you could corrupt the database then you might be still able to make off with the money, even if the logs were tamper resistant. In our system the audit logs are the database, so it isn't possible for the database and the audit log to get out of sync. Audit logs help figure out what happened after the fact, but often, that may be too late. Also, I'm not aware of any database which has sufficiently advanced access control mechanisms to fully implement the kinds of access controls that we have/require (not just ACLs, but also limits, structuring, AML, KYC, sanctions, risk exposure, maker/checker, compliance document expiry, etc.) We store all of these rules in the blockchain as well, so that they are as tamper resistant as the transactions themselves. When crypto-exchanges are broken into, it is never the crypto that is broken, but instead the surrounding infrastructure and meta-data, but we store everything in the blockchain, which helps to avoid that problem.Hmm, I can see where you're going, but I don't fully understand yet. Specifically:</p>

What prevents me from fudging with the audit logs?</li><li>Overall I don't quite get yet what makes this more temper-resistant than just signing and storing all events. Ultimately, if I can access &amp; manipulate the data (logs, events, actual database state, whatever) somehow, it's not really tamper-proof. From my understanding, public blockchains get their tamper-resistance by being publicly distributed and making it very expensive to overrule consensus state (in terms of economic and social costs). Maybe my confusion is how you translate that aspect to a private, centralised blockchain?</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2021-04-08T19:44:31.074Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="#2021-04-08T19:44:31.074Z" class="date">2021-04-08 19:44:31</a> <div class="message"><p>[moved from top level, original post by <strong>@Kevin Greer</strong>]</p>
<ul><li>Yes gain access to the database. 2. Yes, the audit log is the database, like a blockchain. You can't fudge with the audit logs because they're cryptographically hashed. On a restart the server would detect the tampering and refuse to load or startup. This also lets us run our filesystem in append-only mode. Also, the data is not actually stored on the server, but is instead stored in separate append-only MEDUSA nodes. Each audit entry is actually in two blockchains, one specific to the MEDUSA node and the global chain (which is actually a DAG). You would need access to all of the MEDUSA nodes and be able to fake the signatures/hashes.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div></div></div>

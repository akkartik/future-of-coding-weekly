But I think the question "why have so many great ideas been discarded?" is not appropriate. It's rather "Why has nobody pursued all those great ideas until today?"

<blockquote><p>But when spreadsheets get &gt; complicated &gt; they get messy and error-prone and this is what Improv set out to address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end it didn’t go anywhere, probably because in setting out to improve on spreadsheets, Improv lost the essence of a spreadsheet and in doing so &gt; lost the market&gt; .</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>this would lead you to the conclusion that the key strategy &gt; mistake &gt; was to try to market Improv to the existing spreadsheet market. Instead, if the product were marketed to a segment where the more structured model was a ‘feature’ not a ‘bug’ would have given Lotus the time to learn and improve and refine the model to a point where it would have &gt; satisfied &gt; the larger market as well.</p>

I think it was perfect for what spreadsheets are supposed to be, but not for what they actually are. Spreadsheets are generally very sloppy, an according to a study by Microsoft, more often than not, don't actually perform any calculations. They're primarily used just to make semi-structured lists.</p>

(I think some criticism of that is valid!) Thankfully, the goal of the research isn't to have people say nice things about it in Hacker News. 😀</p>

I always describe Dynamicland as trying to escape the gravitational pull of some of our established ways of collaborating.  In as much as they don't have an answer to reasonable, real-world questions, it's because they're searching for a new world, and they haven't arrived.  It's easy to assume that they want to sell us on a new, better world when, in fact, they are still flying through outer-space.</p>

<pre><code>What does it take to get an idea from a research concept into practice?



...



for the sake of other would-be tech transfer pioneers... the next time they show you the new button they helped get put into Visual Studio or the approach that two people in a back office of Google are using instead of lamely saying "that's great", try flipping out and doing cartwheels down the hall. 

They have been part of a real accomplishment that is good for all of us as researchers, helping our profession stay relevant. Tech transfer is NOT just an implementation detail.</code></pre><p>Also, scratch for industrial robots!</p>

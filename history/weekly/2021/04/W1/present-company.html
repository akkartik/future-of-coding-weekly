Why couldn't we decide to adapt the JVM to the needs of WASM, and instead went ahead and created a whole new byte code language?  I've searched online, but most answers are unsatisfactory, e.g. JVM sandboxing isn't secure enough (if so, can't we improve it?), JVM depends too much on Oracle (I thought OpenJDK had solved that problem), and so on.  Curious to know if someone here has an interesting explanation or a good article on the subject ü§î</p>

But I guess there's also a dose of neophilia. The JVM is 25 years old. It can't be the solution to today's problems because otherwise, tons of highly payed engineers would have been blind!</p>

Which doesn't mean it's not better, but the tone of the discourse makes it harder to find a more "objective" comparison with older technologies like the JVM.</p>

Tying it to the JVM could mean that significant, early changes to WASM meant either quarreling with those who maintain the JVM spec (waste of time) or forking from it (and thus creating a separate WASM again, but likely worse)</p>

Lots of interesting research that wouldn't be possible trying to lobby a legacy system.</p>
<p>No GC is also huge. I don't think many people are saying the JVM is bad though : )</p>

<p>The fact that all the browser vendors saw value in asm.js and optimized their JS engines to support it was a big deal. I couldn't imagine the big 3 starting with a blank slate and agreeing on anything.</p>

<ul><li>If you're going to fork, it can be more memorable to make something intended for a very different situation look different. "It's the same except this one little change" falls into an uncanny valley that can interfere with adoption.</li><li>If the goal is a standard people agree to not fork, starting from a fork perhaps sets the wrong example.</li></ul><p>Very interesting. I'm not sure I agree (why does a new standard not feel like a fork?) but you definitely got new neurons firing in my brain.</p>

<p>Starting from first principles, however, is a wild west - because every possible specification to fit the desired criteria will likely have a comparable time cost for implementing tooling, there are no deterrents from building precisely what's necessary and no excuse is required for breaking compatibility.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, the marketing story is relevant - and unfortunately is one of the most important aspects of the decision. Example: I didn't touch JVM languages for years because I hated the clunky verbosity of Java, but Clojure's now the language I use the most!</p>

This is a very preliminary demo, it doesn't really show much:</p>

I can imagine re-running the spanning tree with different weights or something to get a different view of the graph, e.g. focus on a different kind of edge, though that runs a risk of severely disorienting the user. You want the output of the spanning tree algorithm to be pretty resilient to edits...</p>

I'd be keen to play with this. I've worked with a number of tools and editors like this. The tree part is relatively easy, but it does get a little tricky when you have Graphs. I like your colored lines on the right. The path I've been going down lately is to visualize the words as lego bricks in 3d vis with optional tracing/auditing lines shown in 3d.</p>

It's not so complicated â€” until it is.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, you clone whatever object looks most like what you want.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll find that what you meant was that you wanted a copy (independent slots) rather than a clone (inherited slots) at which point, you'll tend to keep a bunch of prototype objects around which have the defaults for everything.</p>
<p>Later, as you start to have complex structures of objects, you'll learn that the right clone/copy semantics interacts with how shallow/deep you want things to be.  It gets messy, and the next thing you know, you're writing factory methods.  ðŸ˜±</p>

IIRC Papert talks about kids internalizing the ideas of calculus and differential geometry but its always a vague, blunt sort of intuition, that you can't solve actual problems with. My gut tells me that it is valuable to be able to have the sharper understanding that comes with being able to solve these problems. Do people disagree with this? If it is valuable to have a sharper understanding then how would "mathland" have to be different to enable people to solve these problems?</p>

There is a gap between the intuition and rigor of a turtle mathland environment and what you do in calculus class. I like your example with the conch shell though. I'm picturing a turtle programatically running through some rectangular or triangular mesh of the region and adding up the volumes.</p>

The mathematical rigor and semantics of the system allows new discovery, but that isn't fundamentally different than more physical proxies. Many concepts in calculus aren't fundamentally difficult either when you break it down, and there's no real reason that children/adults of all ages would not be able to understand "difficult" symbolic logic when piecewise, the pieces are quite simple.</p>
<p>Given this is the future of coding slack, I think we realize the importance of well crafted, composable abstractions that enable us to augment our thinking (albeit in the computational context, an executable form of thought). If children were given blocks that could form other blocks, then there really wouldn't be a real barrier to something like calculus. I think one argument is that the threshold is if those pieces and tools they have allow that kind of expansion - something like pencil and paper certainly meets that threshold.</p>

Symbolic reasoning is awesome, but sometimes it has its shortcomings. A term I prefer is "formal reasoning". I'm not sure if a mathland for calculus absolutely needs symbols, but formal reasoning is a necessity.</p>
<p>By blocks do you just mean these abstractions you can compose with each other? Maybe you have a clearer idea how you could do this than me. On a gut level it seems possible, although I'm a bit puzzled then why we don't seem to have examples of work in this direction.</p>

<p>I think Papert would believe that the most important things to get from calculus are the underlying concepts: "measure the rate of change of one quantity relative to another" and "accumulate one quantity as another changes".</p>
<p>These concepts give you a jaw-droppingly powerful language for understanding and modeling and predicting the world. I mean this qualitatively, but a rigorous understanding of this language also leads to differential equations, which underly essentially all dynamic systems.</p>
<p>When you say "solve problems like the area under a cycloid or parabola", my guess is you're talking about symbolically computing derivatives &amp; integrals. This seems to me to be vastly less important. (Especially symbolic integration! I learned so many integration tricks in high school which I have literally never used, even throughout an undergraduate education in math and physics.)</p>
<p>You might not mean symbolic computation, though! You might mean knowing:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>how a shape can be broken down into small pieces [strips below the parabola],</p>
</li><li><p>how this can be described as a relationship between quantities [strip height = f(x)],</p>
</li><li><p>how integration expresses the assembly of these small pieces [area = âˆ« strip height Ã— strip width = âˆ« f(x) dx]</p>
</li><li><p>how hand-calculation or a computer program could approximate this integral.</p>
</li></ol><p>I'm into all of these things, and I expect Papert would be as well.</p>

Won't do it justice.</p>
<p>(1) Calculus as a class combines two types of ideas: (a) theory of limits, derivatives, integrals, (b) practice of fairly sophisticated formula manipulation.</p>
<p>(2) A Mathland focuses on giving students a feel for (a) theory.</p>
<p>(3) One can master the (b) practice without a good feel for how the&nbsp;manipulations are related to (a) theory.&nbsp;A lot of time energy spent on the product rule, not so much in getting a really good feel for what it does.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-04-22"></a><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-04-22">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-04-22</a></p>
<p>A big thank-you to <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> for nudging me to prioritize graphics. It's had the unexpected side-effect of stress-testing the environment (programs drawing a pixel at a time easily get to large loop counts and array sizes) and uncovering all sorts of limitations that went unnoticed in my previous text-mode prototype (<a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1607329853147000"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1607329853147000">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1607329853147000</a>).</p>
<p>The Mu shell is still super slow and constantly runs out of memory. Partly I rationalize away that limitation by waving my hands and saying, "it's just for prototyping, throw away the prototype and rebuild it one level down." But interesting prototypes may well need to be large programs to truly test the right hypotheses. We'll see where this road leads.</p>

I show just a few things: real-time visual updates to the flow depending on user input .. and a just-in-time compiler to webassembly embedded in the flow, also with real-time visual output. 2 minutes is too short to show everything I've done or to dive in deeply, but still... I hope you like it!â˜ºðŸ˜€</p>

Basically define a project with its technical difficulties you need to solve(it needs to be "unique" for you). As a one-person business you need to spend 500 hours yearly on that project and its technical difficulties. </p>

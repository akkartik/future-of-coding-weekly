<p>Admittedly there isn't a JavaScript version yet, but I wonder, <a href="https://www.devhelpr.com/">Maikel van de Lisdonk</a>, if you would be interested in using a standardized syntax like this for your expression language.</p>
<p>At its core, though, my idea is less about standardizing syntax and more about standardizing the in-memory syntax tree between different languages, and so there are two modestly different versions of the syntax right now, and then there is Enhanced C#, which is a superset of C# based on these same syntax trees.</p>

For example, the Python code</p>
<h1>Leading comment</h1><pre><code>if c &gt; 0:

    x = f

else:

    y = f(123);</code></pre><p>could be converted to an identical syntax tree as the one produced by the C/C#/Java code</p>
<pre><code>// Leading comment

if (c &gt; 0) {

  x = f;

} else {

  y = f(123);

}</code></pre><p>Specifically, I could write a converter that would take any output from tree-sitter and convert it to a Loyc tree. I could then use LeMP macros to straightforwardly convert the syntax tree of a particular language into a mostly-common format. And comments could be preserved too, as I have written a language-agnostic algorithm for this purpose.</p>
<p>Now, from the readme and article about tree-hugger it doesn't look like tree-hugger does something like this, but correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>This wasn't the problem I was interested in solving - I wanted to figure out how to go in the reverse direction, from Loyc tree to text, because part of my dream is to help people convert code between languages. But seeing this video makes me want to ask if conversion to a common format is something that would help the Docly project. If so, I available to help at below-market rates.</p>
<p>You could certainly have a separate ML model for each language - there may be enough code on GitHib to support this approach, at least for popular languages, but perhaps not for new or obscure languages. But if you convert all languages to a common format, a single model might be able to share intuitions across languages, potentially allowing improved summarization in a single model.</p>

<p>This was a nice fun project that aimed to solve a problem that has been requested from the Autodesk Maya team for decades (not kidding): how do you drag an object on any surface, and have it position and align itself to the normal of the polygonal face under your cursor.</p>
<p>The graph that you're seeing basically queries the mouse's screen space position, converts it to world space position, then shoots a ray from the camera to the world to detect the hit position and the orientation/normal of the position that was hit. This position + orientation is then used to set the position/rotation of the object pTorus1 in the scene.</p>
<p>The artist of course doesn't see any of this: they just have basic nodes that allow them to query such data, every node and its properties are rich with descriptions, making it easy to hover over anything and know a) what it does and b) what it expects as a connection.</p>
<p>There's still lots of things that I'd love to improve on the user experience here. If you ask me how satisfied I am with the UX I'd say 30%, because like with any VPL there's always this impression that you're missing something so obvious yet crucial to really changing the game üòÑ</p>

What we're doing with GraphN is a system of "Context" where you'll be able to create tools for Maya, Unreal Engine, standalone tools or just user interfaces.</p>
<p>The core tech behind it all is Python + some accelerated arrays/math/geometry libraries, so we can do anything from folder creation to mesh processing.</p>

<p>I worry that people will lie on their taxes and say that they followed your app when they get audited. That would open you up to legal liability. Particularly if you aren't showing up in their returns as a paid preparer. (Rentierism by licenses.)</p>

<p>Figma on a macbook trackpad is one of the few times I‚Äôve felt a truly DIRECT connection to the thing I‚Äôm making, to borrow Bret‚Äôs lingua franca.</p>
<p>I can move / edit / tweak at the speed of thought, besides video games its the most extension-of-my-body-/flow-think-at-speed-of-thought tool I get to engage with. I‚Äôve built up tons of muscle memory, can do pretty much everything with keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Good keyboard shortcuts + designed for trackpad from day 1 means that Figma mostly lives at my subconscious level and ‚Äòfades‚Äô to the background</p>

"Subconsciously" ‚Äî probably text selection, copy, paste covering several lines.  The more complicated activities can't be done with muscle memory as they require too much coordination with the UI and potential for slip-ups.  I don't call it muscle memory if you can't "do it without looking" ‚Äî in quotes as I direct manipulation to hit a well known screen target requires looking but is basically subconscious.</p>
<p>A guess another one is saving text out of an image to share later.  I use mis-use Evernote as a queue of interesting things to share with my family, and what with people posting screenshots to the web rather than typing, I use Screenotate to undo the process.  So the complex action is:</p>
<ul><li>See the image worth extracting text to share from.</li><li>Type command+shift+0 to enter Screenotate screenshotting mode.</li><li>Track over to the upper left corner of interesting text.</li><li>Drag to lower right corner of interesting text.</li><li>Click on Evernote elephant at top of screen.</li><li>Wait for Screenotate OCR to finish.  I just have a feel for how long it takes.</li><li>Command+V to paste the OCRed text.</li><li>Click the Evernote "Convert to Note" button.So eight steps that are basically a continuous gesture.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-02-04T09:43:19.101Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jack Rusher</span> <a href="#2021-02-04T09:43:19.101Z" class="date">2021-02-04 09:43:19</a> <div class="message"><p>All the most complex compound actions I can perform on autopilot are in the context of sport.

I ended up deciding that a language that I would not be willing to use for all of my coding tasks is not general purpose, even though it might be according to some theoretical criterion such as Turing completeness. The distinction becomes tricky when it's the ecosystem rather than the language that makes the difference. I wouldn't want to use Pharo for analyzing protein structures, for example, but only because I'd have to write all code from scratch whereas in Python, for example, much of the work has already been done.</p>

Where there is no such thing as a syntax error, type error, or runtime error? Where every text string (or AST) is executable? I'm thinking this can be done with a compositional approach to errors: instead of crashing when a result is undefined (due to syntactic or semantic errors), return an "undefined" value, which in turn poisons all of the expressions it is used within, similar to how NaN works. Would such a semantics have merit? It would let you run incomplete programs (like <a href="https://hazel.org/"></a><a href="https://hazel.org/">https://hazel.org/</a>), and also let you recover from errors (with the equivalent of an isNaN() function). But perhaps most importantly, it would be a good foundation for a live &amp; persistent programming environment: if there is no need for code to be checked prior to execution, then there doesn't need to be a "compile time". This doesn't make programs harder to reason about: a programmer can still use static analysis tools (incl. "type inference") to understand and enforce runtime behaviour (e.g. verifying/requiring the absence of "undefined").</p>

It is not compositional, and Go programs still crash in a myriad of ways.</p>

But it is always compiling in the background, ready to run if it can. If an error is returned, the program doesn't crash and they aren't exceptions. You can ignore the error, process it, generate a more specific one, etc. However, it still has the problem of the developer not knowing what errors could be generated, which is a problem in every language I have ever used, and a tough problem.</p>
<p>I'd love a language that specifically separated functions between those that can and cannot return errors. Functions that can return errors should return them as values and the documentation should list exactly why and when an error is returned. Additionally, the errors should be pattern matchable.</p>

That seems interesting.</p>
<p>There's also the approach of Elixir and Erlang that take the stance that errors are unavoidable, so they provide mechanisms to recover when they do happen, including live inspection. (Which is what I understand the Common Lisp condition system to address.)</p>

<blockquote><p>I'd love a language that specifically separated functions between those that can and cannot return errors.Most functions beyond the identity function and constants can return errors: you simply have to pass them a value that is not part of their domain üôÇ. Sometimes the domain is tricky: for example the div instruction takes all numeric divisors apart from zero, and it's often hard to statically verify that zero won't be given. That's perhaps the simplest use-case for an "undefined" return value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if a value is explicitly considered part of the domain, yet can still induce some "error-like" result (for example, failure to pass a JSON string), then I agree they should probably return a specific error value that distinguishes this class of error from the more general "I passed a string to a function expecting an integer" undefined result.</p>

That's where having a single NaN-like "undefined" value might come in handy: it just declares that an expression was given inputs outside its domain.</p>

There's not necessarily a concept of an error in a Turing machine: the closest thing is if you hit a gap in your transition table, but you can fill those in with any default that strikes your fancy. In a more conventionally shaped language, that probably means ignoring or no-opping any state or operation you don't understand.... so yeah, it looks like JavaScript, but more so.</p>
<p>I haven't tried it, but <a href="http://om-language.org"></a><a href="http://om-language.org">http://om-language.org</a> claims to have the property that all UTF-8 strings are valid OM programs. Unclear how it handles errors, but the words "error", "fail", "halt", and "stop" are absent from its front page.</p>

(With the right UI, I think this is approximately the right model for mixing automatic and human-driven work in general)</p>

Looking more broadly at imperative languages, it's probably only those with structured control flow can "back out" and continue after an error: just jump past/out of the current structure (block, function, etc). Turing machines don't really have a good option.</p>
<p>I should point out though, that I was specifically thinking about declarative languages (those based on composable expressions) as I wrote my original post.</p>

I'd still want someone to be able to write a cloud service using such an environment, so interactive error resolution wouldn't be practical.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<p>" starts a string, and includes anything until the next ". Invalid escaped characters fall back to their literal representation.</p>
<p>A block starts with BEGIN and indescriminantly includes everything until an END is correctly matched.</p>
<p>Unrecognized or unexpected tokens are simply skipped over. So assuming the closing-parenthesis is expected, A(B,C) is the same as A(B,C,+$4:"/üôÉ¬∂</p>

<p>Two open-ended feedbacky thoughts that spring to mind from that:</p>
<p>1:</p>
<p>I think the language could push much more radically in the direction of the design prompt, and away from conventional programming practice.</p>
<p>Some (easy, top-of-mind) ideas... Rather than:</p>
<pre><code>select(contacts, where: (a) =&gt; a.type == DB.person and a.category == DB.contacts)

  &gt;&gt; for((f) =&gt; f.latlon = lookup_lat_lon(f.address))

  &gt;&gt; draw_geomap( coord: (f)=&gt; f.latlon, label: (f)=&gt;f.avatar)</code></pre><p>Why not:</p>
<pre><code>contacts

where(.type == DB.person and .category == DB.contacts)

each(.latlon = lookup_lat_lon(.address))

draw_geomap(coord: .latlon, label: .avatar)</code></pre><p>What's changed?</p>
<ul><li>Rather than explicit lambdas with named parameters, any expression can just refer to an unknown input object. (So <code>.type == DB.person and .category == DB.contacts</code> is a function) This isn't actually even that radical: <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/"></a><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/</a> does something like this. But it's a nice increase in speed-of-thought fluidity, at the expense of things software engineers care about, like explicitness and infinitely-nestable composability.</li><li>Perhaps the pipe operator (&gt;&gt;) will be so common it will be better to have successive lines automatically connected with a pipe. (If you want to stop a pipeline, just add a blank line in the middle.)</li><li>[other minor changes]</li></ul><p>I think much more radical &amp; less obvious changes are possible, but it all starts with breaking away from something that looks so much like JavaScript.</p>
<p>2:</p>
<p>Maybe <strong>@Josh Marinacci</strong> is already thinking about this, but the design prompt also calls strongly for a new interface for using this language. In particular, these pipey step-by-step calculations really want automatic visualization of the data at every step! And a really slick keyboard-driven interface that lets you move around the pipelines at will! Etc.</p>
<p>I hope this work continues to evolve –&nbsp;would be great to see where it goes!</p>

That way you end up with the "trusting trust" problem. So to avoid turning into C, I think you often want a non-circular solution as well that you continue to maintain. Which puts some pressure on the benefits.</p>
<p>Metacircularity is still often a good idea, but not self-evidently so. So I really wish posts like this would start by articulating their goals and why metacircularity makes sense for them.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-02-13T06:22:30.132Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Dan Cook</span> <a href="#2021-02-13T06:22:30.132Z" class="date">2021-02-13 06:22:30</a> <div class="message"><p>In answer to "actually circular" and also "good but not self-evident" (and I may be projecting, so take it with a grain of salt as my perspective):</p>
<p>I think many programmers sense something deeply powerful or profound about metacircularity (a thing "making itself" or "running itself", etc.), but can't substantiate why. The response to this dissonance ranges from dismissing it as intriguing but useless; to finding "usefulness" that is then over-attributed with that sense of power or profoundness.</p>
<p>The powerful idea is that software is made of lever-making-levers: We can potentially leverage all the power of programming, to leverage all the power of programming. That power that is just sitting there, largely untapped; and the (usually unconscious but strong) intuition is that some kind of circular bootstrapping will unlock some form of power like that.</p>
<p>The problem is that the circle needs to be complete for that to work, and there are two approaches one can attempt:</p>
<p>(1) A bootstraps B bootstraps C ... forever. This is a nonsense path.</p>
<p>(2) A bootstraps A.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are plenty of examples that LOOK like option 2, but they are all in fact, option 1. In the example at the top of this thread, that runtime is not running itself. It is a running a copy of itself. That in itself is no different than just having the one layer. If it it's because of the "sandboxing", well how is that different than writing your own custom runtime for (those java components) in any language or platform at all? It being the same language is ... nice, I guess? Ok, so maybe it's the fact that the "top" runtime itself can be controlled or modified or interfaced with from the "bottom" one?  I admit that's cool; but the same could be said of the same runtime hosted on a different runtime / stack. So what does this kind of "bootstrapping" buy, other than "same language"?</p>
<p>And it's a similar story for something being able to "evaluate itself" (or [anything] itself). Usually that the "itself" is not actually it<em>self</em>.</p>
<p>So stepping back, this is just A hosts B. B just happens to be a copy of A. And if that seems deeply exciting or profound for some reason -- that's because there is enormous potential power down that path because of what it makes possible. But unless that power is actually tapped into, then it's just a fact; and I personally think that the programmer psyche struggles at this point to intuit that the circularity is not complete, or what the meaningfulness is behind the intuition of power.</p>
<p>It's like if there were giant robot arms with a joystick that can be used to build or do anything, and we use them to build all kinds of amazing machines that are intuitive to use and easy to interact with, depending on what the thing is. But we do this construction by using the arms to manually construct each thing, piece by piece (aka "coding"). What the heck? Why not make machines to make it easier to make machines? Break away from thinking of everything in terms of up/down/grab/release, and make tools that can be used in whatever direct terms makes sense. Use the arms to change the arms into something better. Except that the arms are not changeable as they are; so, create arms that <em>are</em> changeable by using arms. And none of this: use arm-A to make arm-B and then use arm-B to .... no no, make a self-changeable arm, and then just use that arm! Oh, I need to be able to reach like this today? (adjusts-self) There. THAT is meta<em>circular</em></p>
<p>Interesting parallel: Living structure is by definition, metacircular</p>

The belief that we are has caused us to add so much incidental cruft that if you use industry best practices, you actually do need multiple machines. Taking an extreme example, the entire write load of twitter is only ~6k tweets/s, which can easily fit on a single machine. As another, there’s a great paper from the hyper folks that showed you could serve <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1921-schuele.pdf"></a><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1921-schuele.pdf">http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1921-schuele.pdf</a>. If you use them well, computers are insanely fast. The problem is just that we use them really poorly and because of the incentives around software, we’re more likely to go with our first poor solution to a problem than taking the time to come to a good one. This is how we ended up with things like Hadoop which are millions of lines of code to run 100+ node clusters that <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/"></a><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/">https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>My hope is to flip the problem on its head and show that part of the problem is we didn’t actually go high level enough. Languages like python still let you specify too many details and those details are what prevent us from creating compilers that output extremely high performance programs by default.This reminds me of the Haskell ethos a bit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A language designed to describe pure computation at an extremely high level, then let the compiler figure out efficient ways to run those computations. The language is so high level that it didn't support the very concept of side effects (causing them to invent/discover the monad...)</p>
<p>The result is that the GHC compiler truly is a marvel of modern engineering. But (devils advocate time), It took 30 years of the most advanced CS research to get here, and it still has extremely unpredictable performance gotchas in some places.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I've been jaded by our current world, but I can't see "higher level" as a solution.</p>
<p>Mainly because "creating compilers that output extremely high performance programs by default" is actually a really hard problem for the general case. Part of the problem being: there is no single general case. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SriniKadamati">Srini Kadamati</a> makes the point, a higher level language often results in poorer systems understanding, not greater. Or to put it another way, all abstractions are leaky eventually... How do you handle it when the leaks happen?</p>

They often get "good enough" but it's never "optimal".

<p>This is a profound insight. I remember Jonthan Blow talking about just this in an older talk he gave: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjDsP5n2kSM?t=556"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/JjDsP5n2kSM?t=556">https://youtu.be/JjDsP5n2kSM?t=556</a> TL;DR lists are often fine! Start there, optimize only later / avoid premature optimization. All data structures are fundamentally about optimization.</p>
<p>Fun story of him looking at DOOM source code when it came out how he was chewed out by John Romero when Blow said asset loading was done sub-optimally (back when he wasn’t enlightened!)</p>

How does say Python fair here? It's the staple ingredient in most popular data science / machine learning oriented stacks. Most heavy computation is done indirectly via libraries who in turn call out to tightly optimized C++ or GPU code. On the plus side, that gives you the flexibility of a high level language to declaring your computational flow in with the heavy work done in optimized land. Of course, this also makes it a lot of "fun" if you want to customize / inject yourself into some part of the computation, since you need to drop down to Cython or so.</p>

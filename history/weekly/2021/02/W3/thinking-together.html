Where there is no such thing as a syntax error, type error, or runtime error? Where every text string (or AST) is executable? I'm thinking this can be done with a compositional approach to errors: instead of crashing when a result is undefined (due to syntactic or semantic errors), return an "undefined" value, which in turn poisons all of the expressions it is used within, similar to how NaN works. Would such a semantics have merit? It would let you run incomplete programs (like <a href="https://hazel.org/"></a><a href="https://hazel.org/">https://hazel.org/</a>), and also let you recover from errors (with the equivalent of an isNaN() function). But perhaps most importantly, it would be a good foundation for a live &amp; persistent programming environment: if there is no need for code to be checked prior to execution, then there doesn't need to be a "compile time". This doesn't make programs harder to reason about: a programmer can still use static analysis tools (incl. "type inference") to understand and enforce runtime behaviour (e.g. verifying/requiring the absence of "undefined").</p>

But it is always compiling in the background, ready to run if it can. If an error is returned, the program doesn't crash and they aren't exceptions. You can ignore the error, process it, generate a more specific one, etc. However, it still has the problem of the developer not knowing what errors could be generated, which is a problem in every language I have ever used, and a tough problem.</p>
<p>I'd love a language that specifically separated functions between those that can and cannot return errors. Functions that can return errors should return them as values and the documentation should list exactly why and when an error is returned. Additionally, the errors should be pattern matchable.</p>

<p>There's also the approach of Elixir and Erlang that take the stance that errors are unavoidable, so they provide mechanisms to recover when they do happen, including live inspection. (Which is what I understand the Common Lisp condition system to address.)</p>

<blockquote><p>I'd love a language that specifically separated functions between those that can and cannot return errors.Most functions beyond the identity function and constants can return errors: you simply have to pass them a value that is not part of their domain 🙂. Sometimes the domain is tricky: for example the div instruction takes all numeric divisors apart from zero, and it's often hard to statically verify that zero won't be given. That's perhaps the simplest use-case for an "undefined" return value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if a value is explicitly considered part of the domain, yet can still induce some "error-like" result (for example, failure to pass a JSON string), then I agree they should probably return a specific error value that distinguishes this class of error from the more general "I passed a string to a function expecting an integer" undefined result.</p>

<p>What I'm saying (humor aside) is: What really is a program? What's structure? I can achieve that with exact 1:1 perfection but accomplish nothing meaningful (the print example), or have a Turing complete solution that seems like a joke on the surface, but is actually a quite practical solution (Leetcode).</p>
<p>Of course, the first can be replaced with just print statements, and the second with just digits which is basically just a reinvention of machine code. Sounds pointless, but they fixed what's been identified as a real problem at hand.</p>
<p>But is the problem really in the programming language, i.e. the thing with well defined and unambiguous kinds of pieces and rules for fitting them together? Or is it the medium?</p>
<p>How about an editor where all the different parts of a program are composable like building blocks? Only things that "fit together" can go together. I think Steve Kraus did something about "Types are shapes", and I think someone else here did something about "typed holes"?</p>
<p>Anyway, I realize I'm taking about solving the problem from there other end (and I understand the merits of textual code in "the real world" as it sits today), but I'm just offering a perspective that what if this was treated from the source rather than the sink?</p>
<p>I guess that's the same question (and similar topic in a way) as to why people feel strongly one way or the other (or in different contexts) about static vs dynamic typing. Seriously also explore that thought-space and see what maps back to this one (i.e. only allowing valid syntax vs dealing with any syntax).</p>

<p>Maybe one thing that could mean is code in predefined structural format like Json, Xml, Yaml, S-expressions, etc.</p>
<p>Now, those things can have syntax errors; But the goal isn't really to have exactly no syntax errors; the goal is whatever the goal of having no syntax errors is. Maybe you can get much more from reducing 90% of the syntax problem down to an extremely regular pattern, that many relatively basic editors or validators can already help deal with.</p>
<p>Consider the trade-offs: The range of possible syntax errors becomes a very few things, and many basic tools/editors can make that very simple to deal with (and the errors are trivially obvious when pointed out); You get well defined structure that can be made very meaningful, versus perhaps sacrificing that to some parsing strategy, etc; the format lends itself well to data transfer and various other tools that need know nothing of the "language". Etc.</p>
<p>Still I understand that this might not be the direction the discussion is aimed to go in (and thus I won't continue it further here), but in all seriousness I think it's worthwhile food for thought on the topic, at least worth a mention.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the source document is HTML and the optional PLAIN attribute is specified, all HTML tags are removed and all SGML entities converted to the characters they represent.This just strikes me as bizarre, that the desired behaviour would ever be to strip out the structure of the source to include it. And I'm thinking that maybe this made sense at the time, and that HTML really was used as a markup language, in the sense that you had a valid plain text document and then you marked it up to add additional information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This just has me thinking about how much the web is held back by attempting to continually adapt this notion of markup, rather than accept that the data is meaningless without the structure. I feel like a lot of semantic web stuff is held back by this.</p>
<p>I'm curious what other people think of markup as a concept. Does it apply still?</p>

And in the same way that I like being able to take a small step up toward more structure, I like being able to take a small step down back to less structure. There are times where I've taken an HTML document and stripped all the tags out to recover the plain text. Not often, but it has come up.</p>
<p>I do build web apps, sure, but I also still enjoy that the web is a network of linked text documents, for which it's nice to have tools to add and remove structure.</p>
<blockquote><p>the data is meaningless without the structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends on what the data is. If the data is prose, then the only structure you need, at a minimum, is spacing and punctuation. The web was designed for writing and linking prose-y documents, and just because we've incremented it into an app platform doesn't mean the original prose-y purpose is any less valid, no?</p>

This is my first message here. This thread makes me think of bidirectional transformations (see e.g. <a href="http://bx-community.wikidot.com/"></a><a href="http://bx-community.wikidot.com/">http://bx-community.wikidot.com/</a> ). You'd like to strip out some structure, but not by throwing it away, but by putting it on the shelf. You'd then like to do some modification on the less structured representation (editing the plain text file). And the dream would be to magically add the structure back in, with help of the structure you put on the shelf. It's obviously an ill-posed problem in general, but as I understand it, the research in bidirectional transformations is to characterize when the problem has a solution.</p>
<p>My opinion is that it is generally not possible to find one all-encompassing structure for your data that does everything you'd ever possibly hope for. Not to mention that there are countless existing structures that you might want to interoperate with.</p>
<p>For example, I could see myself arguing "well, if you had to remove structure to make the plain text more convenient to edit in your text editor, that's just a tooling issue. A better text editing tool would allow you to more conveniently edit HTML files". Not only would I be requiring your text editor to be a lot more sophisticated (probably to the extent of solving ill-posed problems), I would also be failing to leverage the workflow and tooling developed over decades upon decades for editing plain text.</p>

I think I'm frustrated by the conflict of the modern web building so much into individual documents rather than relying on pushing the structure into the links themselves. You're totally right that the web can be used in a way that makes it perfectly valid to strip out the presentational markup to quote something. But I think most of the web (or at least most of what people experience on the web) would be made unusable by this sort of transclusion.</p>
<p><strong>@U01M3Q6JEG7</strong> Thanks for the link! I hadn't heard of that as an area of study. It's interesting that you comment on the possibility of an all-encompassing structure because the main project I'm interested in is making a generic graph data structure usable as an application datastore. Which as soon as you have multiple overlapping schemas will immediately bring in concerns about maintaining different (potentially mutually inconsistent) ideas of consistency. I'll do some reading.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> That's good context. I have this sense that if we would have made browsers more powerful we could have avoided a lot of the js that gets written. An example I've been thinking about lately is authentication. Every website has its own login form, but browsers are (well, could be if digest auth were fully supported) totally capable of doing a login handshake with a server. Do you (or anybody) have thoughts on that?</p>

For example, Oak was a language and virtual machine targeting embedded systems developed at Sun starting in 1989, which was eventually released (with a billion dollar marketing campaign) under the name Java. Most people believed in the mid-90s that the kinds of things we do now with HTML/CSS/JS would be done with Java applets. At the same time, Bell Labs released what they built after Plan9, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system</a>), which was an OS/language/virtual machine targeting the same space that (ahem) did not get a billion dollar marketing campaign.</p>
<p>As for authentication, we talked back in the wayback about using an open PKI-based system to handle auth on the web, but it didn't stick. All of the messiness you see today was grown very organically, sometimes by the unilateral action of one or another vendor and sometimes through standards body design-by-committee, all of it etched in stone forever because of concerns about backwards compatibility. It's an unhappy accident of history that we ended up with everything bolted onto a document viewer. 🤷‍♂️</p>

Some folks find it confusing compared to Premiere, but having used both for hundreds of hours, I feel like FCP offers a faster workflow. I also think FCP has a smoother learning curve, FWIW.</p>
<p>My favourite timeline-based editing tool, though, is Ableton Live. It's for music, not video, but that difference is pretty insignificant once you get right to the heart of it. If you're looking for the holy grail of powerful but simple timeline-based editing tools, that's probably the one to beat.</p>
<p>I'm also partial to the f-curve editors you find in animation packages like Maya, 3DS Max, Modo, etc. But those are probably the most complex tools in this category.</p>
<p>Descript is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It's a fantastic tool for folks who don't know how, can't afford, or can't be bothered to use a professional tool. And much like other tools focused on making hard things easy, the result is actually a real joy to use for things that would otherwise be frustrating. Some professional podcasters I follow use Descript as their rough-draft edit tool, before going in to Logic or Ferrite to do a more precise edit.</p>
<p>So like anything, there is no universal "best", not for such a broad category as "video editor". There are plenty of "favourite", but that's going to vary depending on who you ask. But feel free to say more about what sort of UX you're interested in, and I might be able to point to specific details of these (or other — I've been doing video/audio/3d since the mid 90s) tools.</p>

<p>The foundation have done a fantastic job overall: I’ve been using Blender on and off as a hobby for maybe a decade now and every time I come back to it I’m usually in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

It could help with figuring out what a good alternative is, because my understanding is that Electron is as bare bones as you want it to be. It's hard to ignore the fact that Electron seems to have almost 100x the adoption of anything similar, which has resulted in it getting more optimizations and stability on many platforms. Along with there being many more resources for code signing to macOS (which is a hard problem other smaller electron alternatives have not gotten to like <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri"></a><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri</a>)</p>

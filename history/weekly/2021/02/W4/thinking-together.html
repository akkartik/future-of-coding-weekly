The mouse also works, but its use is extremely rare. Is there any UX research into making GUIs keyboard-driven to the extent that the mouse becomes obsolete?</p>

Instead of having functions, where every invocation must explicitly feed in every argument, what if:</p>
<ul><li>we define a language that supports only expressions containing free variables, and</li><li>we treat invocation as merely (lazy) syntactic substitution, thus arguments are "retrieved" from the scope where the expression is invokedFor example, I write <code>let f = x * x</code> (note the absence of a parameter list) and then later write <code>let x = 3; let y = f</code> , which sets y to 9.</li></ul><p>It's important for the substitution to be lazy, since this retains the semantics of traditional functions, including the ability to make recursive definitions. Given this, I don't believe I'm re-inventing macros, though I welcome enlightenment.</p>
<p>You can combine this with the usual nested syntactic scoping rules, so it's definitely not the same as using global variables, or the same as closures (where all the free variables are bound at the definition site). The only practical difference seems to be the UX, and the biggest UX downside is probably readability (which invocations consume which values?), but I'm confident an IDE can make the data flow more explicit.</p>
<p>Advantages of this approach:</p>
<ul><li>Certain programs can become much more concise. For example, in drawing code, you can set the drawing <code>color</code> just once, and it will be automatically consumed by all drawing functions (i.e. expressions-with-free-variables) that are invoked in that scope. This actually obviates the "type classes" feature that functional languages often pursue. (Type classes aim to enable exactly this kind of "implicit argument passing", but achieve it in a more convoluted way.)</li><li>You've removed the concept of a "function call" entirely from the language. You only need substitution (i.e. referencing). Less features is better, when all else is equal.Disadvantages of this approach:</li></ul><ul><li>As mentioned earlier, it may be harder to understand which values are being consumed where. But I'm confident that an IDE can make this clear. (I'm building a language based on ASTs and structured editing anyway, so it's guaranteed to be combined with a sufficiently-smart IDE.)</li><li>You need to worry about "accidental variable capture", where a variable which just happens to be in scope is accidentally used by a function (i.e. expression) invocation. I think this is a real problem in languages where variables are identified by text strings, but FWIW, the language I'm designing is not based on text strings, and so can be designed in such a way that a local variable will never accidentally have the same UUID as a free variable found in a function (i.e. expression). In an AST-based language, every function definition should by default use unique UUIDs for its free variables. Only related functions from the same library should share UUIDs, for example the <code>color</code> variable used in a drawing library should be the same across all drawing functions.I'd love to hear others' thoughts. Has this been tried before? Are there additional advantages or disadvantages that I've missed? Is it worth a try? Note that I'm thinking specifically about declarative languages here. Imperative languages may add complications (but may not!).</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2021-02-17T02:25:12.184Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="#2021-02-17T02:25:12.184Z" class="date">2021-02-17 02:25:12</a> <div class="message"><p>Is this the same as unhygienic macros?

In other words, you can choose between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping on a per variable basis. Indeed, with every variable usage, you need a means to indicate which parent scope you want the variable to be bindable from; essentially you want every scope to indicate its "parameter list" (free variable list). This puts you somewhere in-between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping. It will require a smart syntax to be comprehensible, of course! It would work similarly to how "quoting" works in Lisp or Julia.</p>

You might also look into algebraic effects as an underlying formalism for variable lookup.

Also effects are just really cool in general, which is why today I lean towards using them to handle this use case by-the-way.</p>

It allows code quite similar to the example <code>let y = f</code>  if <code>f</code> or its parameter is marked as <code>implicit</code> . <code>implicit</code> can be used at the value and at the type level. At the value level - they are mostly used to reduce boilerplate; for example; passing around a db connection throughout the callstack could be done by marking it as an implicit parameter; and then not having to explicitly pass it on a function invocation.</p>
<p>At the type level - it is used to support a number of the advanced Scala language features.</p>
<p>I would say its a very actively used feature of the language. Scala has a new major release coming  in which a number of the lessons learned from Scala 2 are being used to refine some areas of the language design and <code>implicts</code> are getting quite a bit of a rework; so could be an interesting case study.</p>

<p>Building type classes is one of the main ways implicits are used in scala; and as you say comes with a fair amount of complexity.</p>
<p>But it is also possible to use implicts without creating type classes. As a prototyping idea - you could mark all parameters as implicit - and then have the reduced boilerplate on the function invocation; and it would also be a way to explore how often implicit resolution issues start coming up (obv that would be limited to Scala's resolution rules; but could still be an interesting worked example)</p>

All of them have one thing in common: they use the type system to deduce which arguments should be passed implicitly. Most languages do this in a very messy way: they look at all the implicits/traits/protocols in the current module, submodule, imported modules etc., and the compiler picks one of those. This is a static selection strategy. In my proposal, the implicit is provided on the stack like any other variable. There's no fancy "resolution algorithm" involved, and the implicit value can be constructed dynamically, which is a whole different kettle of fish.</p>
<p>Now, Scala 3 offers something similar: there's a command to specify a "given Int" or a "given Bool" on the stack that should be used as an implicit argument. The problem with this is that you can only declare one implicit value per type (in a given scope), whereas my proposal doesn't care about types at all: it uses unique parameter names instead. Also, Scala's "given" declarations can't shadow (i.e. override) each other, whereas variables obviously can. This allows you to implement the equivalent of "default arguments", and override them on specific invocations.</p>
<p>In conclusion: I think I've proposed a simpler, more general, and more intuitive approach to implicits than all the other manifestations I've seen.</p>

It's the same feeling as accidentally declaring a new variable when trying to assign to an existing one (almost a dual problem).

<p>I'm reminded of these projects that I had at the bottom of my bookmarks:</p>
<p><a href="https://baturin.org/tools/bnfgen/"></a><a href="https://baturin.org/tools/bnfgen/">https://baturin.org/tools/bnfgen/</a></p>

<p>This kind of technique is used in fuzz testing quite a bit.</p>
<p>If you think about formal FSM/Automata theory, the normal way we use a FSM is to feed a string and see if it gets the end state (that's what a parser does).</p>
<p>You can also run a FSM in reverse to generate random strings from the grammar. The algorithm is usually something like: Start at the starting state, pick a random node, spit out the string that would match that node, pick the next random node, continue until you get to the finish state.</p>
<p>Typically you have a way to backtrack out if you end up in an invalid node. Invalid nodes represent parse errors, so you would fail with an error if you were just reading some user input, but since you are generating your own string, the program can rewind out of the bad state.</p>

The state diagram is hyper away of the rest of our abstraction (our pre-built auth system, our permissioning system) and that's a big part of how we decrease the surface area of code.</p>

The best solution I've seen to problem #1 (how do you get people past the initial unfamiliarity / reluctance?) is to make your GUI look enviably cool. Make the GUI just explode charm, style, je ne sais quoi, mystery. Make it draw people in. Make it look like nothing they've ever seen before. Make it elicit and reward curiosity. Don't allow people to grossly assume that they know what this GUI is, what it does, and that it's not worth the 20 minutes of attention to learn how it really works.</p>
<p>This is a very hard problem, but it's not an NP hard problem. It's do-able, and people do it all the time.</p>
<p>(I answered a slight variation of your question, because the other half of the question ‚Äî how do you make the GUI self-revealing to new users ‚Äî&nbsp;is something it sounds like you already have a good idea of how to do.

I should have added one crazy caveat, we have a "no progressive disclosures" rule right now which makes every design challenge infinitely harder. The reason for this is we think there's going to be some weening required to get devs acclimated to even the slightest GUI mostly cause of legacy rhetoric. So the idea behind our UI is that it has to be entirely keyboard navigatable. So we figured that out on storage with great difficulty. On the behaviour page (the statechart) obviously it's impossible. But we're still holding out in hopes that we'll come up with a way to structure this diagram to make it more auto-layout and then, hopefully intuitively keyboard navigatable.</p>
<p>There aren't that many great ways to do a progressive disclosure and still keep the hand away from the mouse.</p>

There are lots of projects like <a href="http://smc.sourceforge.net/"></a><a href="http://smc.sourceforge.net/">http://smc.sourceforge.net/</a> that define a special DSL. I imagine I'd spend most of my time on the textual mode if I had that, and then use the visual one to browse. A good textual DSL with a cool browsable visual representation (perhaps even retaining just some interactive editable elements) seems like an easier sell than a "1000-clicks-no-code-ui", but that's just me üôÇ .</p>
<p>Good luck with your project! Looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand if the process of incrementally building up layered spans with attributes has a name. I think this is closer to something like a parser combinator that can produce multiple results and fold over itself</p>

The natural language "parsing" there is mostly probabilistic so you can access multiple interpretations of a token span if you want to.

They would put some text from an automotive manual into the tool and look at how the text was understood by the system. There's some internal jargon here: "SIT" is a category for "service information" that most often captures the verb (in this case "clean"), while the "SSC" category captures nouns. The tabular section shows the initial matches in our taxonomy for various terms. The green oval ("SumpFiller") in the graph on the bottom is the part identification, while the rest of the graph shows how the terms were disambiguated using our knowledge graph.</p>

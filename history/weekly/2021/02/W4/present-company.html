It's nice to read someone effusing about a beloved tool from a bygone era. I'm too young (and hot, and tasteful) to have lived through the era myself, but I absolutely recognize the superiority of UNIX when compared to NT, as a lifelong Mac user. I did bristle at "GUI-laden Macintosh", though. That felt unfair to me. The Mac I type this on is thin and light. Whatever weight is added due to the presence of the GUI is hardly noticeable. Surely, the glass in my laptop's trackpad weighs less than the full-travel clicky keyboard and CRT required by your portable UNIX terminal of choice.</p>
<p>Let's all bear in mind that what is being compared here is text vs visual in the context of operating systems, not in the context of programming, which are not the same thing at all. That said, I'm going to talk about programming, because that's an argument I can win. If there was any flaw with the original Macintosh (which there wasn't, but just go with me here) it's that the only visual programming environment for it was released 3 years late. And even then, that environment wasn't truly "visual programming", as the included art tools were entirely separate from the programming tools. At best, you could call it "hypermedia programming", as you had to work very quickly to be able to do the job of both an artist and a programmer. And there we see the true advantage of visual programming ‚Äî by programming entirely with one's art skill, you do not need to waste time developing full thoughts, as you do with writing. With a simple sketch, you can reconfigure your web browser to... do other things. Wow, writing is tedious. Here, let me finish the thought more appropriately: ‚úÇÔ∏é‚öóÔ∏éÔ∏éüÉç‚ñº. Simple!</p>
<p>But rather than concerning ourselves with the worst instances, let us compare only the best. We've seen a text operating system created by thoughtful writers (UNIX), and a visual operating system created by thoughtful artists (Macintosh). We've seen a text programming system created by thoughtful writers (Tcl). We truly have not yet seen a visual programming system created by thoughtful artists.</p>
<p>So nobody is allowed to say visual programming is worse than textual programming, because as I've just proven ‚Äî in your domain, using words (bleh) ‚Äî visual programming doesn't exist yet.</p>

<p>Honest question friends: why don't we take the advantages of both?  GUIs what with their menus and clicks which made it it relatively easy to find out what you could do in an interface at least historically ‚Äî less true now with hidden menus, mouseovers, etc.  But add to that the transcript of recorded commands, composable, and scriptable?</p>
<p>Or alternatively start with the command line, add a more modern iteration of ACME, then add some of the exploitability of showing what commands make sense in context, what options might be relevant, and what objects might handy?</p>

<p>IMO there are two kinds of laziness, and I often think of them as physical vs mental laziness. I tend to think of physical laziness as often a good thing, but mental laziness as always a bad thing. But now that I think about it, I realize the two categories are both applicable to physical and mental work. So I'm not sure what to call them.</p>

I've looked at other options in the past (pretty much everything linked in this thread, as it turns out, so I guess the field is pretty small), but I wasn't able to really get much of a sense for each project beyond this looks unsupported, or the gaps in the docs are worrying.

<p>Many reasons for trialing F# during this phase. It's mostly because it shares a lot of similarities with Rust (which we use heavily), and it has great support in VS Code (which we use mainly since we also use a lot of TypeScript).</p>
<p>I really like the sorbet ecosystem, and believe that F# has a better "works out of the box" feel than languages like Haskell or OCaml. The compatibility with C# is awesome as well to leverage a huge existing ecosystem (maybe: depending on .Net 5 compat).</p>
<p>Honestly, Haskell also feels really intimidating and seems to have a fractured ecosystem of different language extensions. But, that's just my early take on things. I'll certainly hold stronger opinions after spending more time with FSharp</p>

That makes a lot of sense, the whole interplay with other technologies from the NET ecosystem.

<p>Haskell is a weird animal, but on the other hand it does have pretty good IDE support I think - although probably not as good as F# does. I wouldn't say system is fractured, there are just many extensions to choose from - but never felt like a problem.

<p>If the idea is to take ideas to use in your own projects then that's probably true.</p>
<p>As a base format, though, it seems like a useful synthesis that would solve/improve a number of present-day problems.</p>
<p>I'd consider the editor as separate, but an easily-parseable, compact, recursively self-descriptive, structured data format with s-expression-like "commands" seems like it has a lot of potential for improving user experience without a heavy abstraction cost.</p>
<p>If the data has structure then I assume a general-purpose editor would need to be structured as well. (correct me if I'm misusing the term). The current alternatives seem to be a plethora of subpar general-purpose text formats or custom binary formats for each use-case. I'd be happy to be proven wrong here if there are other, better alternatives! üòÑ</p>
<p>Both Infra and UTF-8 purport to be general-purpose binary formats, but Infra seems to allow for many more use-cases.</p>
<blockquote><p>all of which have traditionally been addressed as separate research areasThis jarred for me slightly: siloed research presumably has some benefits for investigating orthogonal concepts, but surely at some point the lessons need to be synthesized for real-world use-cases. In order to have a structured editor or programming-by-example system you need to have some format, and a binary format with the above-described benefits doesn't seem like a bad choice.</p>

<p>A structured editor (by definition) presents and allows manipulation of the abstract structure of a document (usually, we talk about ASTs). An abstract structure is a format for a human to consume. This is orthogonal to a serialization ("binary") format, which is a format for hardware to consume. A binary format's only purpose is to instruct the computer how to encode data in its transistors, capacitors, electrons and photons. Only low-level engineers (ideally: OS engineers) need to concern themselves with binary formats, and that's why I consider them orthogonal to structured editing. My conclusion: they are best researched separately. If you are making a product, aimed at allowing low-level engineers to manipulate binary formats using structured editors, then that's all well-and-good, but it's not research unless you're doing HCI.</p>
<p>(I'd extend my argument to include programming-by-example but this is getting quite wordy.)</p>

<p>i think the core of the infra project is about structural editing done homoiconically. the binary format is just the logical bottom for the homoiconic part. so the reason i don‚Äôt see it as a mishmash is that all the structural actions are in the same language as normal data updates. so instead of type.addCase or whatever, you interpret the data structure of a table as representing cases and do a primitive table add when you want to add a case. it‚Äôs the same as any other table. having trouble articulating it and maybe it‚Äôs something all structure editors have‚Äîidk. but infra‚Äôs symbol semantics and patch datatype also represent functions in the same plain old data structures‚Äîso a function is just a partially interpreted table where some symbols evaluate to themselves. that seems pretty different to me</p>

<p>i‚Äôm definitely on the ‚Äúinfra is an important piece of work from a research perspective‚Äù sidere: how novel Infra is from a research perspective: I don't really consider myself versed enough in the current research landscape to have an informed opinion.</p>
<p>An abstract structure is a format for a&nbsp;&gt; human&gt; &nbsp;to consume. This is orthogonal to a serialization ("binary") format, which is a format for&nbsp;&gt; hardware&gt; &nbsp;to consumeI would partially disagree. I would suggest that they are correlated insofar as you need the binary format to be capable of (efficiently) representing the concepts invoked by the abstract structure. You need to be able to map your intent into something the machine can actually do, and the strength of this mapping matters.</p>
<p>Only low-level engineers (ideally: OS engineers) need to concern themselves with binary formatsThis requires there to be a better higher-level format that other people can work with instead. This seems to be what Infra is aiming to provide.</p>
<p>If you are making a&nbsp;&gt; product&gt; , aimed at allowing low-level engineers to manipulate binary formats using structured editors then that's all well-and-goodI wouldn't describe either the format or the editor (or the use of either) that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're referring to the editor as the product, I would describe it as aimed at allowing users of a variety of proficiency-levels to view &amp; describe their data in a structured way. The format is the same, but for allowing programmers to create programs that users in turn use to create &amp; browse this structured data.</p>
<p>I can't tell if we disagree on the significance of binary formats in general. As I see it, everything on a computer is based on a binary format plus some layers of abstraction/indirection/meaning, so at some level Infra has to be represented in binary. All other things being equal (which of course they tend not to be! üòõ), fewer layers is normally better.</p>

Would ye oracles of the future of coding be willing to chime in on some of the technical aspects? It's for a non-profit that has the capacity to do a lot of practical good in the present world.</p>
<p>The grant is for a "digital transformation" of civil society in my province in Canada. The non-profit I'm building the proposal for is an organization that supports and financially audits over 150 community associations, representing over 20,000 volunteers and close to 1 million neighbours. My city is unique in the sense that a portion of our municipal operations are done by these distributed volunteer associations. As a rule however, these associations are very inefficient from a technological standpoint. Many of their workflows are done manually via paper.</p>
<p>My question is this. Do you think that the world of low-code/no-code solutions has become accessible enough for me to create a series of micro-grants for individual volunteer groups to do their own digital transformation? Or should I simply push all these associations through a unilateral transformation programme (like buying them all Google suite)?</p>
<p>I am biased towards creating a series of competitions around specific workflows that need to be digitized, and using the grant funds to fund prizes. I've worked with close to 30 civic-tech volunteers over the last year with some success, taking that approach. However, it has some risks of longevity. Perhaps it would be wiser to just take off-the-shelf solutions.</p>
<p>Yet I see this (perhaps simplistically), as an invitation by a government body to rethink the society and technology interact. If we talk about how we wish the economics around coding was different, this strikes me as a practical opportunity to build an alternative model. When it comes to the long-lasting design of what that technology looks like, I'm out of my depth. What do you think?</p>

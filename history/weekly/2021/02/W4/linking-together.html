So metacircularity is either dismissed as pointless, or recognized as automatically profound and powerful, regardless whether it's leveraged in any meaningfully powerful way.</p>
<p>The powerful idea behind metacircularity (which often sensed but rarely realized) is that we can potentially leverage all the power of programming, to leverage all the power of programming. Software can be is its own lever.</p>
<p>But this is not what you see in most "metacircular" software. It's usually more like using a robot-arm to control another identical robot-arm, versus using the arm on itself (e.g. to give itself new or improved capabilities). Less like a living cell, which contains (and thus "is") all its own apparatus for defining / executing / replicating itself; and more like a virus, which does not.</p>
<p>(That's the link I see between "living structure", "unfolding wholeness", and what I called "actual circular" metacircularity).</p>
<p>An example of what I think this would look like, is software that is actually written (and subsequently interpreted or created from) within itself.</p>

Though I'd weakly claim that CA's notion of living order includes the environment, particularly people. It feels tenuous to connect it to metacircularity.</p>
<p>Is any software metacircular by your definition? Smalltalk?</p>

The gaps are in whether it's actually used that way (e.g. treating arches like bricks and building a pyramid out of them); or that it's still forced through artificial layers (like "language") that are taken as a given, but which are actually just one of a million possible "interfaces", any of which could be self-contained.</p>
<p>MPS has the right idea, except that it provides a plethora or set-in-stone concepts, interfaces, layers, and languages for everything -- which I find highly ironic, given what is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Racket gets an honorable mention for being the best "make your own language, in your own language" language; but it's very linear, and forced through the very specific paradigm of specifying, creating, etc etc, all through parsing textual language. Zero progress at escaping that, but it does it WELL.</p>
<p>Actually, Rebol / Red may do it better in some (but not all) respects. It's parsing util(s) treats not only the thing being parsed as a datastructure, but also the code doing the parsing! I think it's just called "parse", and there's a write-up about this that's google-able.</p>
<p>The principles of the moldable objects initiative (or whatever it's called) that <a href="https://twitter.com/jryans">J. Ryan Stinnett</a> is part of, are actually pretty in line with this stuff. I don't think it's prescriptive of what I'm talking about here, alright I think the goals overlap.</p>

<p>Mechanism:</p>
<p>The living thing necessarily contains it's own code (or other self-representation -- DNA is code), interpreter(s), replication, ability to replace it's bits while preserving structure &amp; identity, and all this is self-contained, ergo the living thing "is" / "does" these things / "has" these capabilities.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>Capable of adapting, changing, preserving, etc, in a way that dynamically keeps it fit for it's purpose or environment, evolving / learning all the while. Conversely, a thing that must be painstakingly redesigned and/or thrown out once it is no longer fit (if it was even a good fit at all) for some very specific (perhaps very static) purpose it was rigorously designed for, is in essence "dead" at creation.</p>
<p>Environment does control a metacircular software thing, because that's the whole point. A car "that can do anything" really means that YOU can MAKE IT do anything (for whatever "do anything" means). That is how it can be perfectly fit and adaptable, because it provides a means to adapt "itself", including (by definition of being "fully" metacircular) those means it provides to do so.</p>

Video games usually set this up by creating webs of artificial hurdles, and you obviously don't want to be doing that in a PL. For example, in Factorio you periodically run into bottlenecks in your factory, for example a belt reaches its capacity, or you start running low on a resource. It's fun to resolve these artificial constraints, and that's what most of Factorio is about. There's no analogue of these things for writing code üòï (except perhaps performance optimization, which is rarely "fun").</p>

The hurdles don't have to be artificial to be fun. There are lots of times in programming when you can make incremental, measurable progress. If you've got your abstractions and data model set up right, you can crunch your way through e.g. UI or web request handling (recent examples for me). At its best, writing video game code itself feels the same. TDD is (in my understanding) in large part a way to make that feedback loop more repeatable.</p>

<p>I don't believe that that's true. I can't prove it, but it doesn't feel right. But I would totally agree with There's no known analogue of these things for writing code.</p>
<p>I have it as one of my ambient background shower-thought processing tasks to figure out how to design game dynamics (to borrow the sorta dated "mechanics / dynamics / aesthetics" framework) that encode programming-related tasks, such that you can enjoy playing with these dynamics in a game-y system while still accomplishing actual creative / expressive work (loathe to say productive work, but sub that in if that thought doesn't irritate you the way it does me).</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine a ton of kinda-bad "gamification"-y visions. The most well-known bad example is probably Github's contribution tracking. It incentivizes opening and closing a lot of low-value issues, and making a lot of tiny low-value commits. But Github also fosters the social motivation to write good docs, which is very good (and very conventional) dynamics design.</p>
<p>I think once we're playing in the "Factorio is my IDE" space, there's plenty of unexplored possibility and very little should be taken as a given.</p>

This probably means they need to be self-defined, seeing how measuring software productivity is an open problem and will likely remain that way forever.</p>
<p>I just remembered: possibly the most video-game-like experience I've had while "programming" was my brief experience trying to prove things in Coq. Real goals (of a sort, these were practice problems), with a little dopamine hit when I proved each one, including subgoals. Sometimes I had to think creatively, sometimes I could just grind through. Similar to the TDD example, I guess, treating a spec as the goal. If it's not exactly a research direction in itself, I think this is at least a potential payoff of improving the ergonomics of formal methods.</p>

I think it's very true that text is the safe bet, given its flexibility and how hard it is to get that same expressiveness in other media. It would be a mistake to say that means text is the only way forever and any alternative is doomed, and I suspect that's why Graydon danced around actually saying that.</p>
<p>With that said, using math notation as an example in the context of computer systems is a bit iffy. I mean, he's mostly talking about encoding and transmission, but it's hard to separate "text is awesome" from the existing widespread tooling, and that latter part is not totally there for math (it exists, but in small patches relative to the larger ecosystem). Again, not exactly what he said, so I might just totally be projecting my bias here.</p>
<p>I would definitely say that if you're going to go beyond text, natively supporting math notation would be a good direction to go. Casually using a bar for division in a large formula would be great.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago?&gt; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A study found that Java developers&nbsp;&gt; backtracked&gt; &nbsp;every 6 minutes, meaning they reverted their code to a previous state.&nbsp;These undo actions come in bursts and are often followed by successive redo actions. In fact, one participant in a different study used undo/redo 40 times in 5 minutes!&nbsp;When asked why they did this, they revealed they were trying to view some intermediate state of the code in the middle of a change. Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago while in the middle of a change?</p>
<p>The author later presents a prototype named Yestercode</p>
<blockquote><p>It lets you&nbsp;&gt; swipe&gt; &nbsp;through your code history on a timeline, much like you would a YouTube video. As you make edits, it aggregates them and puts a notch on the timeline for that version. You can then use the timeline to go to a previous version, giving you a side-by-side view with the current version of the code. The previous version is read-only, but still allows copying and pasting from it. It also shows annotations so that you know what has been changed in later versions (much like a diff).</p>

<p>It's true that it's still a pain to copy-paste out of history or otherwise partially restore it. The UI this author proposes sounds neat, but only if it transparently works with (at least) git.</p>

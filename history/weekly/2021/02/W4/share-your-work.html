Here's a demo of some (fairly barebones by the standards of previous demos) operations of the live-updating postfix shell.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214"></a><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214</a></p>
<p>If you're curious about the sources, start browsing at <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html"></a><a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html</a>. The architecture is much cleaner than the prototype I was working with before. Functions contain lines, lines contain words, words contain gap buffers. Rendering a thing renders its constituent things. Render takes a top-left coordinate and returns a bottom-right coordinate. Each thing knows which constituent thing has its cursor, shows its cursor when rendering, redirects keystrokes to it as they come in.</p>
<p>That's the positive. On the negative side, my experience working with bare metal leads me to despair of ever getting a disk or network. I spent 3 weeks at the start of the year struggling to support a mouse before I gave up. I gave up not because it's impossible to build (I was almost there) but because it's impossible to explain to anyone, at least with my current level of development. There's just too much historical accident in dealing with ancient PS/2 hardware that modern systems continue to pretend to be. And PS/2 was supposed to be easy. At least there's a single lowest-common-denominator way all devices work. With disk and network even that disappears. You need to support umpteen devices. Which means anybody hacking on their own computer now will encounter hardware their computer doesn't have, and which they shouldn't have to care about. In other words, going down this road seems to lead only to where we already are.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about what's next. The thought of giving up on Mu has crossed my mind. It may yet happen. When I started Mu I had programs I wanted to write. It was always a means to an end. Lately I can't remember what they were, and the projects I recall seem obsolete, overtaken by events. There does seem to be one niche where one can write interesting programs about the world without needing to actually, you know, talk to the world over HTTP. That niche is simulation. Building computational models. And it might even be particularly important to the world in the next few years, given the volatility and turmoil I see all around me. As a baby step, here's Conway's Game of Life in Mu without an operating system: <a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13"></a><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13</a>.

For a while I used to implement Life in every new language I learned. Not sure how or why I stopped.</p>

<p>I've been counting on my fingers when I hear from someone who seems to have actually tried to run Mu. In spite of all my efforts to keep it accessible, I'm not out of fingers yet. So I'm loath to add new constraints. At some point it must make sense to just consider this path over-constrained and go do something else. (Or maybe it means I haven't found the right vein of potential collaborators to tap yet? Hmm, perhaps the right machine would help there.)</p>
<p>There is one option I'm reluctantly starting to focus on: virtio. This is apparently a driver that only works atop an emulator or hypervisor. Programs within the VM get a nice interface, and the VM translates it to real-world hardware (perhaps using a mainstream OS). If I go this route you'd need a cloud computer to run Mu üò¨</p>

For those who haven't seen our previous work, we are working on Wasp (<a href="https://wasp-lang.dev"></a><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a>) - an open source DSL for building full-stack web apps. We have been applying to YC for the last year or so, and finally managed to get in. We are still in pre-alpha, but we are excited about this as it gives us an opportunity to give a harder push to possibly making Wasp become a real thing. This community has been a great help in the last year, both with providing feedback and inspiration, so thanks for that - I always wish to participate more and return back some of that, I hope I will manage to do more of it in the upcoming time.</p>

<p>In every activity you have to decide who your audience is. Restaurants are for users, so we should make them more like Smilies. It's only when we make things for programmers that we should make them more like Unix. More amenable to composition in larger, unanticipated aggregations.</p>
<p>This feels a lot more nuanced than your conclusion, "It turns out, the most important user of a program is not a human using a program." I don't think that's always true. It depends on what the program is.</p>

<p>But focusing on programmers can sometimes involve providing lots of information so that a run is more intelligible. One of my favorite tricks is emitting facts deduced to a log, and having tests make assertions on the log (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/tracing-tests"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/tracing-tests">http://akkartik.name/post/tracing-tests</a>). So I still think you're over-generalizing from Unix here. All we can conclude in general is that programs should probably provide a silent mode and a verbose mode, and which one you operate in depends on the situation.

<p>There is such a thing as <code>stderr</code>. Unix has it for a reason.</p>
<blockquote><p>-v to verbose say things other than what's surprising is a common unix option but that's opt in, not opt out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm claiming that there are situations where the right default is a little more verbose than complete silence. Imagine a server where the default log level to stdout is INFO. I've found that handy at times. The real interaction happens in another window, and that frees this one up to be verbose.</p>

The Art Of Unix Programming completely changed my view of eng design.</p>
<p>I'm imagining an architecture where the GUI can be modularized out. It doesn't need to be a separate process or anything. I'm imagining a layer of code which has API/TUI entry points and that the GUI is built on top of. Then everything below the GUI is easily composable with other programs (esp testing), and the GUI happens to be a nice way to make it easy to interact with the program.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it matters if there are exceptions to the rule. If you're going to hold a simple rule, it's better to err on the side of silence than on the side of noise. Should you hold a simple rule? I believe so because I've found there's bigger fish to fry.</p>

<p>Similar to what <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a> asked, who is the audience? On one hand they need to know Haskell, but on the other hand they want to build an app from their mobile phone? That doesn't sound like a same person. I am in general confused about building an app from phone - I can hardly imagine somebody wanting to do that compared to doing from their PC, unless it is drag and drop maybe, but this doesn't sound like it? Or maybe I am getting the whole thing wrong?</p>
<p>It would be really interesting if you could describe the problem in more details -&gt; in which situation might somebody want to use Compose. Or what would usage look like, through a story.</p>

The fact that you discovered some of the properties which enable that, to be baked into Haskell, is incidental.</p>

The risk this has me worrying about is the error experience. How you give good error messages tailored to a small screen without having to fork a Haskell compiler. Or do y'all plan to fork?</p>

<p>Imagine a slightly different status quo: Who'd want to use a computer? If you really want to be productive, you're going to need a whole laboratory and your own factory, and your own biodome and space suit.</p>
<p>My goodness! How badly has programming and technology evolved, that you can't use simple tools to compose logical components in a simple and straightforward way?</p>
<p>It used to be unthinkable to browse the web or do MANY things, that are now mostly done from "phones" now.</p>

Writing programs often involves doing multiple things at the same time: research (browser), coding (IDE), running/looking at logs(terminal). It is intensive activity, because problems we are solving are hard, so having proper equipment (multiple displays, keyboard, mouse) does make a difference. That said, maybe I am just old fashioned and future is on the phone who knows! Although, if future woudl be really be on the phone, I would expect some novel kind of interface (like projected screen or keyboard and similar) that enhance both output and input capacity, but then it comes back to being a computer. Don't mind me too much, just thinking out loud. For the context I am Haskell developer.</p>

I'm sure heavy duty intensive development will stay as you say; but the scope of all software development by anyone (e.g. as a new kind of literacy and/or thinking tool), can expand far beyond that. You certainly wouldn't write a thesis on your phone, but look at all this discussion we are having from my phone! It might have been hard to predict decades ago that people would "casually" "type up" thing after thing with just their thumbs, but the context for that didn't used to exist (and we have tools and context for this that would have been hard to predict). But certainly, that hasn't become the "new" way of sitting down and writing a serious paper. I think the same could apply for creating the "stuff" of software. That might not be called "programming" though, just like this here is not "writing a document" in the sense that that used to (and even still) connotates.</p>

<p>Comparing to Rails, this announcement comes well before the first public presentation and fifteen minute demo.  Let me add that at Ruby Conf 2004, maybe 3/50 were using Ruby professionally, and the first question to DHH after his presentation was "What editor is that?"  Second question was "Can we get a copy?"</p>
<p>If you want a Compose demo to attract Haskell people, Explorable Explanations of some classic Haskell papers?  FRP, STM, and Parsec come to mind.</p>

I am interested to see what is the response on this and what is the right type of experience that can trigger this new kind of behaviour (development on phone), certainly an exciting experiment! Business side sounds somewhat tough, but there is always time to explore that further if usage is there.</p>

<p>The more I learn about other people's future-of-coding experiments, the less original my own ideas seem, to the point where many of them don't seem worth sharing anymore. Do I have anything left to add to the conversation? Maybe! At my day job, I work on codebases of up to 100k lines of code, written by small teams, in mainstream languages. Barring a complete revolution, what incremental improvements can I imagine in my daily workflows? I've started sharing these ideas in a series of video talks, and in some cases also with clickable prototypes.</p>
<p>The first video <a href="https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04">https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04</a> is an introduction, but to you here in the Future of Coding community, it might feel like I'm preaching to the choir, so feel free to skip ahead. Video 2, 3 and 4 each explain one standalone idea, like "Stretchy code map" or "Call graph navigator". I'm working on the 5th as we speak. If you prefer to read text over watching video, transcripts are available on my bare-bones website <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/"></a><a href="https://emilprogviz.com/">https://emilprogviz.com/</a></p>
<p>I've worked on this in isolation for years, so now I'd love to hear some encouragement, but even more I'd love to hear which particular ideas you like best, or how you would improve on them!</p>

<p>Your production values are fantastic. I so appreciate your attention to framing, sound quality, preparation, editing, and other aspects of communication. Irrespective of the content itself (which is great, but you'll hear that from a ton of other members I'm sure), you need to know that the effort you've put into the quality and clarity of your expression is not lost on this audience, and is in fact exemplary.</p>

Overlap is super encouraging, I agree with Dan! I meant it as an explanation of why my initial videos show relatively minor ideas, compared to the more lofty goals this community is aiming towards. I share the lofty goals too, but I didn't prioritize them - we'll see if I can contribute anything more than "+1" there, later.</p>
<p>Ivan, thanks so much! This kind of feedback, while tangential, is lovely to hear. üòä:partying_face: It's true that I put in a lot of effort, and I'm glad that it seems to help the message get across. I guess I got somewhat burned when early attempts at sharing my ideas IRL, with improvised elevator pitches and sloppy sketches on napkins, mainly caused yawns, misunderstandings and shallow dismissals. These experiences made me realize that I needed to work on my delivery! Also, a former colleague was a successful Youtuber (FunFunFunction) and although I have zero desire to become a Youtuber, I guess I can't resist striving towards that quality bar in the videos.</p>

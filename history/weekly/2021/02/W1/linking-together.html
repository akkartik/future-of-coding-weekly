<pre><code>Currently, Mes consists of a mutual self-hosting scheme interpreter and C compiler. It also implements a C library. Mes, the scheme interpreter, is written in about 5,000 lines of code of simple C. MesCC, the C compiler, is written in scheme. Together, Mes and MesCC can compile a lightly patched TinyCC that is self-hosting. Using this TinyCC and the Mes C library, it is possible to bootstrap the entire Guix System</code></pre><p><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guix-further-reduces-bootstrap-seed-to-25/"></a><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guix-further-reduces-bootstrap-seed-to-25/">https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guix-further-reduces-bootstrap-seed-to-25/</a></p>

You don't want to lose your software installation when you close your browser. But "possible" is very different from "easy". The hard work behind Guix is not designing and implementing the infrastructure, but patching thousands of software packages to fit into the framework. That's hard enough for today's Guix which is a variant of Linux (same kernel, same basic filesystem (POSIX), but very different conventions for file management). For WASM, it's likely to be worse.</p>

<p>Interesting to see argument for end user programming from 2004. It also uses “Meta-Design” definition i haven’t seen before</p>
<blockquote><p> Meta-design characterizes objectives, techniques, and processes for creating new media and environments that allow “owners of problems” (or end-users) to act as&nbsp;<u>designers</u>. A fundamental objective of meta-design is to create socio-technical environments that empower users to engage actively in the continuous development of systems rather than being restricted to the use of existing systems.</p>

<p>One thing I can come up with is that if you're profoundly confused it'll take you into a state of beginner's mind almost automatically, which probably removes some barriers and encourages an open attitude towards learning something new. Whereas something that looks familiar leads you down all kinds of paths that are "obvious" at first sight, but then they aren't, at least not completely, and you end up in this entangled mess of some bits working as you expected and others not at all. Your knowledge gets in the way and nowhere in the process have you been encouraged to open up to something different.</p>

<p>This is my feeling also and is also what I was trying to get at with:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it's a challenging idea to think about what encourages exploration and play more. Is it the right-approach to completely remove any barrier such that any idea is ready deducted from the environment? Or is the right-approach to actually intentionally add in barriers such that they must be broken by the user or that the environment provides an almost plinko like experience?</p>

I also suspect that, similar to how video games challenged UI design, that injecting more fantasy, lore, atmosphere, rule-breaking into the space gives surprising results. VPLs are an opportunity to depart from the platonic grid of text, yet almost immediately we've adopted a set of idioms and norms for this domain as well :yawning_face:</p>

<p>I have spent my professional career working in LabVIEW, although I know other languages like F#, Racket, Python, et. al., and LabVIEW is, in my opinion, the current most general purpose visual programming language. So I have dealt with these biases a lot, often in person and unfortunately in interviews. It's honestly a pretty rough ride being a professional visual programmer when 98% of your industry colleagues think your tool is a joke and not "real" programming.</p>
<p>If I respond here to the person's tweet, I believe they are asking the wrong questions. I don't think I would make an argument about visual programming necessarily being more "concise and readable", nor do I have a particular example that stands out as being one that would be readable in a visual programming environment and unreadable in a text-based one (for one, which language?). For one, I don't even know how you compare conciseness and readability. Those comparisons are ill-formed when comparing two text-based languages.</p>
<p>The context in which to discuss visual programming is that it is just as valid (no more valid or less valid) than text-based programming. The real cornerstones are of representation and paradigms, again, just like how one compares text-based programming. When I think of what language to use (beyond technicalities), I like to think in paradigms and which one is best suited to represent the problems I have.</p>
<p>Additionally, visual languages more readily provide live feedback, and so this is also where the argument gets lost, because visual programming tends to blur the line between program, the program running, and viewing the program in either of these states. When I program LabVIEW, I do not even have a compile step. It's compiling all the time, running type propagation to let me know what's broken, allows me to (by default) debug a running program by touching the data, etc. Yes, you can do this in a text-based environment, but I think the visual environment invites this more and makes it easier.</p>
<p>So when I think of visual programming, I personally think of concurrency, dataflow, visual feedback, touching my program, etc.</p>

I always think of building my program at layers. That's why LabVIEW, when done properly, can be rather beautiful. I work a lot with hardware, so the layered approach is natural. Hardware drivers wrapped in classes wrapped in state machines wrapped in actors.</p>

The thread contains the usual arguments and positions that seem to be set in stone. In my opinion, there are good arguments on both sides of the VPL vs. textual PL argument when you filter the irrelevant nonsense out (e.g. "I can type faster than I can drag nodes").</p>
<p>Generally, the discussion is about whether relations between parts of the system should be displayed visually (e.g. by lines connecting blocks) or implicitly by having the same name in two places (e.g. function declaration and function usage). The latter approach requires the programmer to imagine the structure in their head, which requires talent and experience to do well.</p>
<p>Humans are great at understanding spacial structure, so explicitly showing that structure does make sense. If you don't want to take my word for it, look at all the UML stuff or programmers drawing pictures to communicate their ideas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, showing ALL relations doesn't scale, just as stated in the twitter post that started the discussion. Take a <code>utils</code> lib in your project as an example. It is used almost everywhere and disturbs the relevant project structure when shown visually.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the crucial point is focus and abstraction. I believe that visually showing "the bigger picture" can really help understand a project, especially when it's large. It's just that you can't plot all relationships between all parts on a 2D canvas and expect people to understand it. That's also not what programmers using textual PLs have in mind when they think about the system. It's ok to hide some details in order communicate the higher-level dependencies.</p>
<p>Another important part is perspective. For code I've written, I have a pretty good mental model and probably don't need to actually see the structure on screen. If I need to understand someone else's project (or my projects from 3 years ago), it's really beneficial to have that overview available. This social issue is probably more important than the technical ones. Experienced programmers and people who mostly work on the projects they created don't benefit from VPL as much as beginners and people trying to understand existing stuff.</p>
<p>I believe that the optimum is somewhere between textual PLs and current VPLs. Being able to choose between different views (see Projectional Editing) seems to make a lot of sense. Additionally, I'd like to see a system where users can specify which parts should be shown visually and which ones shouldn't be. Think of this like a street map where as you zoom out, only the most important streets are shown.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So it seems Alan is burying the lede a bit, and actually agrees with Ken, albeit arriving at that point from a different start.</p>
<p>Given the web we got (not the web we wanted), it is a mistake to try to retrofit it into an app platform, especially in such an ad hoc / incremental / design-by-accretion way. Short of a time machine, though, I'm not sure how we get that web of objects with end-user editing we ought to have.</p>
<p>As an aside, this bit stuck out:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the great realizations of the early Unix was that the <em>kernel</em> of an OS — and essentially the only part that should be in “supervisor mode” — would only manage&nbsp;&gt; time&gt; &nbsp;(quanta for interleaved computations) and&nbsp;&gt; space&gt; (memory allocation and levels) and&nbsp;&gt; encapsulation&gt; &nbsp;(processes) — everything else should be expressible in the general vanilla processes of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what game engines are (naturally). But game engines also don't have to worry as much about all the security, IO, hardware, and other baggage of modern OSes. That means game engines end up being quite pure articulations of that "time + space + process" conceptual structure, and I really feel that when working with them. (And others seem to too — quite a few game developers even pass it through to the player via gameplay. Thinking of games like Roblox, Minecraft, Sim[x], etc.)</p>

<p>If you started from first principles, you may not really even need a browser. Or rather, it’d be something way different and the use of that word / naming may be inaccurate!</p>

My current understanding has mostly been pieced together from tweets and a few of <strong>@Omar Rizwan</strong>'s more detailed blogposts. As I currently understand it, the system functions mostly as a federated Linda-like tuple space where wishes and claims are evaluated 60 times a sec and acted upon, and there is a base set of verbs and nouns (mostly related to the hardware) that are implemented in the system.</p>

I don't think it's a naivety problem so much as different values than you.

Commercializing has a ton of drawbacks in terms of exploratory research which is obvious to anyone that's done this work. The plan with Dynamicland was always to tear down the system and build anew every few years to learn more about the new medium</p>

I love how your recent explorations have moved away from projectors/computer vision to try out different models of imbuing computability into objects. I think a lot of people get stuck on that aspect of DynamicLand, whereas my feeling is the use of projectors/computer vision was the quickest way to test what it feels like to have physical objects with malleable computability instead of the difficult approach of custom embedded chips (and dealing with powering them, etc). I imagine a future incarnation of DynamicLand might use room-size inductive charging and a bunch of 32bit embedded processors with sufficient power to run a small VM along with other sensor modalities.</p>

To a certain kind of computing: embodied, colaborative, flexible, playful.</p>

Problem is that they in turn seek a commitment say from one of more patrons around funding. And funding to the tune of 2 mill plus a year with no external commitments is difficult to achieve. My advice to Bret was that the only way to achieve that would be to figure out some way to commercialize some parts of the technology (the more mature parts, say in tangible maps or kids education). Start with a hybrid patron plus commercial model and hopefully transition to a largely commercial model where the R&amp;D spend can be much higher due to the non profit nature of the organization. </p>

I've used spreadsheets for keeping track of some numbers, but I haven't used spreadsheets in any serious capacity. I have maybe a small sense of what makes spreadsheets compelling, but I suspect I'm missing some things. I'm curious if there are any "canonical" articles out there that describe the core ideas about spreadsheets and their relevance for the future of coding. If not, I'm curious how members of this community came about these ideas, and what we would say those ideas are.</p>

IMHO  apart from all the declarative formula based stuff its important to realize one really powerful thing about spreadsheets - they let people just get going inputting data in a free form fashion. There is really no cognitive burden around app design, screen building, metadata notions, any of that stuff. The problem of course is that as a result it is difficult to take the spreadsheet to the next level. Therefore the spreadsheet stays at that limited but very valuable use case - initial data entry, lightweight compute, and some level of collaborative information curation and syndication. </p>

For both tool families, the initial barrier to becoming productive is low, but there is no support for managing the evolution (and in particular growth) of the software artefact. Which has as a net result the establishment of bad practices.</p>
<p>The lesson for FoC projects, in particular in the category of "end-user programming" (much as I dislike that term) is that such systems need to consider growth paths from the start. Which means pointing out the limits of a particular interface early on, and facilitating the migration to more complex but also more powerful tools.</p>

What's so intriguing is that it does this in a nearly "modeless" way (or at least the modes that do exist are relegated to a few relatively transient contexts): that is to say, there's no explicit "beginner mode" or "advanced mode" in Excel, it's all just there, out in the open. Another notable principle is that the abstractions that exist in the app aren't particularly "leaky" (unless we're talking about pivot tables, or the things that <strong>@William Taysom</strong> mentioned, in which case, oh boy, haha), but this is certainly not the primary draw.</p>

<p>how spreadsheets can be objectively 10-100x+ better</p>
<p>programming UI experience than traditional linear documents</p>
<p>for certain use cases.</p>
<p>First there's nothing you can do in a spreadsheet language</p>
<p>that you can't do in a linear language, and vice versa, in</p>
<p>terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The only difference is in terms of User Experience, and the</p>
<p>time it takes to build things in one environment vs the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>A very common operation is to work with tables of data.</p>
<p>Making easily parseable tables of data is dead simple in</p>
<p>Excel, very difficult in linear langs. In the latter you</p>
<p>have really primitive tools for filling, selection, etc. It</p>
<p>is easy to misalign things. You don't get good secondary</p>
<p>notations (conditional highlighting in excel, for example),</p>
<p>which can be great visual aids. And you often have to insert</p>
<p>noisy delimiters like commas, and worry about escapes. You</p>
<p>are definitely talking about on the order of at least a 10x</p>
<p>speed up in user time to do these kinds of things, and more</p>
<p>realistically on the order of 100x.</p>
<p>Not just for tables, though. The information density of</p>
<p>spreadsheets can be really high (you can arrange your</p>
<p>programs into tiles, tabs, kanban boards, gantt charts, etc,</p>
<p>not just a single linear sequence of token). Massively more</p>
<p>combinatorics to make a visual DSL that fits your problem</p>
<p>domain better.</p>
<p>I could go on. But those 2 UX advantages, one in table</p>
<p>manipulation and one in the visual arrangement of a project,</p>
<p>alone hint at some pretty big non-linear differences in</p>
<p>spreadsheet programming paradigms vs text editor paradigms.</p>
<p>Things that can be numerically and objectively measured and</p>
<p>have orders of magnitude differences, and are not matters of</p>
<p>opinion.</p>

<p>Well, don‚Äôt want to derail this thread further. Thanks for explaining!</p>
<p>To bring this back on topic:</p>
<p>Spreadsheets were invented at a time where there wasn‚Äôt such a huge distinction between users and developers, and it shows. Today we seem to focus so tightly on specific use cases that most apps offer extremely specific and therefore limited workflows and deviating just a little from what's been envisioned by the developer is either impossible or extremely annoying at best. </p>
<p>Back then, use cases were much broader and more open-ended and offered much more latitude for users to try out different things. Perhaps because tech was much more limited back then; perhaps because developers trusted users to be much more technical back then. </p>
<p>Bottom line: I think we need more tools that leave room for end users to discover the use cases they need for themselves. Developers are seldom user domain experts and that‚Äôs where a lot of the friction comes from. Precisely why I think the future of programming will be determined by end users and not today's developers.</p>

<p>I started playing around with Excel at a very young age. Like others have said already, it's really easy to get started. Just point somewhere and enter some text or numbers. You can then gently discover more and more functionality just by searching through the menus and lists of formulas. By the age of 14, I knew more about Excel than my IT teacher in school.</p>
<p>Excel is an environment in which you can discover new things and try if they do what you want. I was able to learn about much of Excel's functionality without using external sources. I didn't need to use google often and didn't even know what stackoverflow was at that time. This is a large contrast to learning a "proper" programming language where you start on an empty text buffer and need to research what you may put into it.</p>
<p>Using Excel requires so much less computer science knowledge than mainstream programming languages (e.g. "what's the difference between an int and a float?"), and yet you can solve a lot of real-world problems with it. This focus on end-user problems and abstraction of technical details (e.g. "what is execution?") is a big part of Excel's success and something we still don't really see in mainstream programming languages.</p>
<p>That being said, you'll reach the ceiling of what Excel is good at sooner or later. This is where macros, VBA and friends come in and ruin the experience. A lot of future of coding ideas want to improve on this, making spreadsheets scale gracefully to more complex use cases while retaining the low barrier of entry.</p>

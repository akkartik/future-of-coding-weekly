<blockquote><p>The story of computing is the story of humanity&gt; : this is a story of ambition, invention, creativity, vision, avarice, and serendipity, powered by a refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds.&nbsp;Computing: The Human Experience&nbsp;is a transmedia project that explores the science of computing, examines the connections among computing, individuals, and society, and contemplates the future, taking us on a journey of what it means to be human in the face of a technology that can amplify us, diminish us, and most certainly will co-evolve with us.</p>

<p>Not exactly FoC, but I thought this might be interesting nonetheless!</p>

Together, these two galleries are a fantastic resource for exploring various GUI moods.</p>
<p>HOWEVER ‚Äî there's a big gap here, and it's especially striking for this Interface In Game link. You can't actually touch and use these interfaces yourself. So you don't get any sense of how they feel (and in many cases, how they animate, how they sound, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, that constraint might be a good thing. Rather than being confronted with something so visceral that you can't help but take it as a complete, singular thing, by only getting a visual of the GUI you have just the taste of it in your mouth. You have to (and get to) fill in that big gap with your imagination.</p>

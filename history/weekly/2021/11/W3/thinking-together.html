It is really a complex negotiation: how transparent should a tool be? How changeable to still gain traction? How can you as a creator help individuals to create value and or even groups?</p>
<p>The larger PKM/Personalised Information trend we are seeing, I think is no fluke. People are trying to live the good live, it may start with having all your information or a reasonably size of it at your own disposal, for introspection. From these patterns can emerge : "Oh look I'm binge consuming information"  - How do other people deal with this? Can I have a meaningful discussion about this with other people? Its a Meta Reflection on many levels and people navigate in their own ways towards it but I believe its really they are looking for "the good way of life".  web3 is a huge as in humongous experimentation space, e.g. people thought prediction markets would work, but they didn't. They tried and are trying and will try crazy things. Its a very interesting substrate for stories and memes.  (<a href="https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/infinite-stories-in-blockchains"></a><a href="https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/infinite-stories-in-blockchains">https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/infinite-stories-in-blockchains</a> ) As such its as much about your "tool" what you will provide as it is about "the way" you will choose to interact with said ecosystem (token, voting, proposals, DAOs etc...)</p>
<p>So in some sense people are in deed looking forward to have a conversation with you through the medium that is your tool and said "way" of interacting with people. Interesting times ahead for tools for conviviality :)</p>

This tweet made me think of a possible answer: epistemic transparence (of text) vs. epistemic opacity (of data formats requiring more specialized tools for inspection). We have so many tools for inspecting text files that it's hard to imagine that someone could sneak in a tool that deliberately misrepresents the information in a file. Human-readable data encodings in text files thus provide acces to a shared ground truth. The tools intermediating between bits in memory and UIs (screens etc.) are so simple that they are easy to understand and easy to verify and validate. Even for relatively simple structured binary formats such as tar, this is no longer true.</p>

<p>Another related possible reason is reproducibility - if I can see some plain text, I can reproduce it quite easily.

What sets text apart is its extreme generality, leading to widespread tool support. If you have the slightest worry that a text-based tool is hiding something from you, you just check using one of the hundreds of alternatives. As for <strong>@Stephen De Gabrielle</strong> comment about the complexity of text: most real-life data formats use only a tiny subset of Unicode, plus perhaps full Unicode in string data. Decent Unicode support matters (and is widespread), but full support is rarely required.</p>

Key aspect: text has (almost) no room for hidden state. A text editor is pretty much surjective onto the set of binaries that won't crash your text editor, and once it opens you can change any byte... Of course the eldritch complexity of Unicode spoils a lot of those "guarantees". If we're going to replace text, I'd honestly like a format that offers even better surjectivity (onto parsable files if not onto binary strings).</p>
<p>The fact is, if your visual editing tool doesn't let me inspect every literal bit of code, I will never fully trust that bugs in your editor aren't hiding important things from me. For serious applications, that's a problem.</p>
<p>(Also, text is convenient when dealing with "invalid" under-construction states.)</p>

We could have something else as the "ground truth" layer, of course. But it matters that this layer is accessible to a large range of tools.</p>
<p>Illustrative example: a Smalltalk image. Reflection provides the means to inspect the object graph, and Smalltalk comes with the tools to do so. But all that access goes through the Smalltalk VM. If you have to envisage the possibility of a compromised VM, you can't trust your system any more.</p>
<p>The same holds of course for the file system layer of a typical Unix system. But there is diversity-with-compatibility. Don't trust btrfs? Use ext4. Paranoid? Store all your stuff on three different file systems, and run consistency checks from time to time.</p>
<p>In the end, it's tool diversity that matters. No single bottleneck for accessing your data.</p>

The image files exist b/c in the end we are all running a unix. A more smalltalk smalltalk would be a collection of objects with addresses living in some ecosystem, remote or otherwise. Kay had imagined each object being a VM, fully self-contained. We are just shoving the current VM onto unix, which is what it is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Even the word &lt;&lt;file&gt;&gt; evokes old thinking in a new medium, thinking that has nothing to do with computing but with how we organized paper medium based information. This is one reason why the ‚Äòyounger‚Äô generation is trending towards a complete lack of understand, or mental image, of files, folders, directories. In the world for them it‚Äôs just ‚Äúa bunch of stuff‚Äù out there and ways to find the stuff. (Of course we don‚Äôt give them good metaphors for how the stuff should be found but that‚Äôs another story.) But their mentality is modern, it‚Äôs a computing mentality, even if the much of it amounts to improved means to an unimproved end.</p>

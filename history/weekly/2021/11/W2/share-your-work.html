I‚Äôve created a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for people to express ‚Äúproduct definitions‚Äù of consumer products (apps+web apps), which can then be ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù into full running software, and a platform that actually generates the app builds, generates and hosts the backend and web apps etc.</p>
<p>My belief is that it is too hard to build consumer software today. This difficulty is in large part because we build at too low a level of abstraction. I believe we should raise the level of abstraction to the conceptual level for defining most features, and only write custom code for things that can‚Äôt be expressed at this high level. With that approach, we can compile the high-level abstraction to native UI for all platforms and make developing polished x-platform software ~1000X+ easier.</p>
<p>Would love any thoughts / feedback, and would love to find people interested in this space to collaborate with (and just raised some money to enable that)!</p>

<p>I believe we share the same vision of building a DSL for building (web) apps while still giving developers the flexibility to write their own code when needed -&gt; I am co-founder of <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/"></a><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">https://wasp-lang.dev/</a>.</p>
<p>We are aiming for a similar thing, but instead of going for a visual DSL (GUI) we are implementing a textual DSL (programming language) that is then also compiled into JS stack (for now).</p>
<p>We also recently raised a seed round so I think we are in a pretty similar position.</p>
<p>We are certainly in same space and therefore competitors to some degree, but I am actually much more excited to see other people believing in the same vision then I am afraid of competition üòÑ, so I am looking forward to see how Sutro develops and let me know if I can help in any way.</p>
<p>Also happy to hear any thoughts / feedback on Wasp!</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[October 16th, 2021 9:44 PM] ak: Has the utterly brutalist approach to end-user programming ever been tried? Just forcibly package up apps with all their dependencies, along with all the tools needed to edit, build and run them?</p>
<p>For a while now, we've had this notion of "end-user programming" in this community: the ability to modify software while we use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/033.html">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/033.html</a> by &lt;@U5TCAFTD3&gt;
<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/">https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/</a> by &lt;@UF6RLAL7J&gt;
<a href="https://malleable.systems">https://malleable.systems</a> by &lt;@UML4ZEKDK&gt; is also relevant</p>
<p>Here's a sketch for an MVP that provides this experience in the bluntest, most obvious way possible:
‚Ä¢ Download a framework packaged as a single file, including all necessary dependencies. You download it from an https URL, and that's it, you're good to go.
‚Ä¢ It only supports *nix platforms on desktop machines. Linux, BSD, maybe Windows Subsystem for Linux. Macs are explicitly out because they're basically not an open platform anymore[1]. And we're going to need an open platform for the sorts of stuff we're planning below.
‚Ä¢ You can install arbitrary apps from arbitrary sources that run atop the framework. The apps are in interpreted languages and always come with source code.
‚Ä¢ When you run an app, it always opens on the app first. This is important. There's no REPL or IDE front and center. The interaction modes are whatever the app chooses.
‚Ä¢ When you run an app, the framework always shows the privileges it has in some consistent part of the screen. The vocabulary and enforcement of those privileges is the major responsibility of the framework. Needing it to be always visible is why you need a desktop machine with a large screen.
‚Ä¢ The app can ask for privileges, but the framework gives you the ability to lie to the app. Here's a simulated network environment that looks offline or has these honeypots. Here's a simulated file system with almost nothing or a few honeypot files. (Inspired by the Arcan project: <a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6">https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6</a>)
‚Ä¢ While running any app, the framework always provides a consistent set of primitives for interacting with the interpreted sources for that app. Imagine a button in the corner that flips a Hypercard over to open an editor on its sources, or something like that. Once you're in the editor you can modify it, run it, get syntax errors, test failures, etc. The editor and build environment themselves are implemented in the framework; for the MVP we'll assume we don't need to support modifying the framework.
I wonder how far Glamorous Toolkit is from this sort of experience, &lt;@UE1JQM9HQ&gt; &lt;@UJBAJNFLK&gt;. On one hand it massively over-delivers on the editing framework. The sandboxing stuff is a new frontier with lots of open-ended questions on the best experience to avoid confusing people before they understand how things work.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking about building on something less ambitious for an MVP, like libSDL atop femtolisp or LuaJIT. Maybe also JavaScript :grimacing:</p>
<p>[1] Like, it's great Apple that you eliminated vectors for malicious apps with all the restrictions on installing software. But I already had a perfectly good and healthy and functional relationship with the folks who provide gdb. When you prevent me from installing gdb, that's not cool. It's good to want to protect people from dysfunctional relationships. But to require all relationships to go through a single point is not. /rant</p>

<p>Scott Anderson ‚Ä¢ End-user Programming in VR</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ImpossibleScott">Scott Anderson</a> has spent the better part of a decade working on end-user programming features for VR and the metaverse. He‚Äôs worked on playful creation tools in the indie game Luna, scripting for Oculus Home and Horizon Worlds at Facebook, and a bunch of concepts for novel programming interfaces in virtual reality. Talking to Scott felt a little bit like peeking into what‚Äôs coming around the bend for programming. For now, most of us do our programming work on a little 2D rectangle, with a clear split between the world around the computer and the one inside it. That might change ‚Äî we may find ourselves inside a virtual environment where the code we write and the effects of running it happen in the space around us. We may find ourselves in that space with other people, also doing their own programming. This space might be designed, operated, and owned by a single megacorp with a specific profit motive. Scott takes us through these possibilities ‚Äî how things are actually shaping up right now and how he feels about where they‚Äôre going, having spent so much time exploring this space.</p>

<div id="2021-11-02T00:04:07.034Z" class="post"><span class="user">Dalton Banks</span> <a href="#2021-11-02T00:04:07.034Z" class="date">2021-11-02 00:04:07</a> <div class="message"><p>A thought that’s been crystallizing for me is that the essence of ‘coding’ is modeling &amp; simulation (not e.g. data and functions). These themes show up all the time in FoC contexts, but as far as I can tell they’re rarely the ROOT metaphors of a system.</p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of examples in “real engineering,” what Alan Kay refers to as CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM-&gt;FAB system. Do you know of examples of ‘convivial computing’ projects where modeling and simulation are the main event, or readings on the topic? What do you think of this premise?</p>
<p>Here’s a recent <a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-Alan-Kay-see-any-new-ideas-in-computing">Quora answer</a> for more context: Does Alan Kay see any new ideas in computing?</p>
<blockquote><p>“New” is not what I look for. “Ideas that make a qualitative difference over past techniques” are what I’d like to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, I’m fairly sure I was aware of pretty much everything regarding computing that was going on in the world. Today, I’m definitely not aware of everything, so it’s reasonably likely that if there was something really great being done somewhere that I wouldn’t know about it.</p>
<p>I would be most interested in learning about “qualitatively more expressive” programming that is more in line with top-level engineering practices of the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM-&gt;FAB systems found in serious engineering of large complex systems in the physical worlds of civil, electrical, automotive, aeronautical, biological, etc. engineering.</p>
<p>In the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM part I’d like to see the designs understandable at the level of visualizable semantic requirements and specifications that can be automatically simulated (on supercomputers if necessary) in real-time, and then safely optimized in various ways for many targets.</p>
<p>Isolating semantics in the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM part implies that what is represented here is a felicitous combination of “compact and understandable”.</p>
<p>The FAB-part pragmatics are very interesting in their own right, and besides efficiencies, should be able to deal with enormous scaling and various kinds of latencies and errors, etc.</p>
<p>The above would be the minimal visions and goals that I think systems designers within computing and software engineering should be aiming for.</p>
<p>I’m not aware of something like this being worked on at present, but these days this could be just because I haven’t come across it.</p>

<p>Dalton, are you suggesting using simulation metaphors for things like programming email filters? 🤔</p>
<p>Would HyperCard and HyperTalk fit the bill?</p>

<p>all that said, yeah, <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a> programming email filters is squarely in the realm of what i’m talking about. you start with a model of reality that also includes your computing environment - your machine, its OS, your browser, the mail server, etc etc, which you can always drill down from whatever abstraction your dealing with if needed. you define a model for what unfiltered email is like (‘science’), a model of what you want your filtered email to be like (‘design’), and come up with (science) &amp; implement (engineering) rules you think will achieve that. simulation is a powerful tool to aid in the ‘coming up with and implementing rules’ part (’what happens if i project this rule on this inbox model over time?’). to close the loop you also want some nice tools to see if it’s working how you want it to. netlogo enables some of this in a very ‘science-y’ not ‘user-y’ context. hypercard gives you some nice tools for very ad hoc experimentation.</p>

<p>Absolutely! For me personally, "the essence of ‘coding’ is&nbsp;modeling &amp; simulation" is exactly where I've come from in everything I've done in this space.</p>
<p>I wouldn't just cross out "e.g. data and functions" as a result though - you can't exactly throw those out! Even when in the most modelly and simulatey world, you'll need to present data to the user to hold current states. And behaviours of those states is basically going to boil down to something like functions, even if presented more abstractly in pretty graphics. I mean, even Excel - the financial modeller/simulator - has those!</p>
<p>For me, programming is creating new realities or simulating existing ones. I often refer back to the early Macs which introduced to the world a wordprocessor program that made the page actually look like the printed page you'd end up with, instead of glowing text floating on a black background that bore no relation to it. This is modelling or simulation of printed paper.</p>
<p>In social media or chat you're modelling or simulating the relationships between people: their social graph. You're simulating them talking (or perhaps passing little paper notes to each other!)</p>
<p>Of course, 3D virtual worlds and Augmented Reality are the extreme of this position, as is the programming of IoT devices.</p>

<p>all good examples of modeling and simulation, though i wouldn’t say 3D VR is necessarily the extreme.. e.g. you can have rich representation capabilities but very poor modeling &amp; simulation capabilities. this is partly why a lot of MMOs despite flashy graphics struggled to achieve the immersive quality of text-based MUDs.</p>
<p>IMO it’s getting easier &amp; easier to hop around these these layers while programming and it can be hard to keep track of where the lines are drawn, to the detriment of comprehension.</p>

<p>It's been a while since my last post in this group, and it feels good to be back with some new FoC-related thoughts: I've been thinking about the tree structure of file systems recently and it turns out that they're limiting and require workarounds for relatively common use cases. Files contain data, but don't have children. Folders have children, but can't store data themselves. What if a file system had "nodes" that could store data AND have children?</p>
<p>I've written a blog post about this and would like to hear your thoughts. As I'm not a native speaker in English and not really talented in writing, I'd be interested in feedback regarding the content as well as the general writing style etc.. Thanks in advance and looking forward to interesting discussions!</p>

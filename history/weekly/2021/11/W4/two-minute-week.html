This is my first post on Alpha here, so I want to establish a little bit of context. (The next posts will be shorter.)</p>
<p>Alpha—a programming language for extensible systems (and hopefully malleable ones in the future). I imagine it as something in between of Julia, Emacs Lisp, and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on it for a month now, so it’s still an infant. It has REPL, user-defined types, multi-methods, and a print function, but not much else 😁</p>
<p>So far it serves two purposes:</p>
<ul><li>it is a playground for me to experiment with PLT ideas (multi-methods, JIT, gradual typing, etc)</li><li>it allows me to gain actual experience implementing languages (my problem is that I have too much knowledge and too little practice)</li></ul><p>This week I was adding a garbage collector. It was tougher than I expected, but I got it working with the host language. The compiler still needs to be modified to produce the compatible code, so that’s the focus of the next week.</p>
<p>Here is a larger update for this week with memory layout images and some tips on debugging GC:</p>

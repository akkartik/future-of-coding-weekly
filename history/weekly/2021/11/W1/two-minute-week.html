Basically this is a side project of a side project.. because the visual webassembly compiler uses the flowrunner-canvas project and extends it with webassembly compilation and visualizations.

Is that accurate? Did you record video first and overlay a narrative over it?</p>
<p>The visuals look amazing (I kept rewinding to pay attention to details) but I don't quite follow what's going on. Is all the code for the compiler also on screen or something like that?</p>
<p>(Sorry I haven't watched all the previous videos in your series.. when I make these I try not to assume what viewers have watched, and always describe some foundations for each video. Which gets increasingly challenging as you make more videos ðŸ˜„)</p>

<p>Have you considered having the dynamic recompilation in the context of a text-based language? Just smush the text from all the nodes in a function into a single text area. Is that really worse than all the boxes and arrows with strange names?</p>

I agree that laying them out like this is not quite making things clearer. Multiplying a matrix takes like 20 nodes.. in comparison, I've actually put the code for the inverse matrix in one node, and that really helps. Although it still has 5 nodes on the top of my head</p>

Perhaps showing them further away and with some fog or blur applied, or in a single node with a portal like functionality. Although the current implementation is too heavy already using both 2d canvas and DOM nodes.</p>

Either in text or video.</p>
<p>There's always a trade-off in going from the density of text to a visual framing. But different projects like PANE or Apparatus have some subtly different reasons for giving up the density. So it would be helpful to understand the details of where you're coming from.</p>

For accessing memory the addresses need to be calculated your self currently, which offcourse is not how you want to do itðŸ™ˆ. My other project (the flowrunner-canvas project which participates in the review-jam) operates on a higher level</p>

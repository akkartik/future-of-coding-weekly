But I would be curious: What are your thoughts on the "Metaverse": <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJecbZWSbVs"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJecbZWSbVs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJecbZWSbVs</a></p>
<p>Exciting &lt;=&gt; Frightening? Indifferent? Especially from what we often discuss here the agency perspective, will this development lead to more centralization and more negative effects? Will it lead to better or worse - human relationships? Thank you!</p>

If you just look at the kind of culture we have, how could you think that more things like AR are even a good idea?</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2021-10-29T13:59:59.007Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Chris Rabl</span> <a href="#2021-10-29T13:59:59.007Z" class="date">2021-10-29 13:59:59</a> <div class="message"><p>Indifferent at the moment: I think the extreme views (Black Mirror-type dystopia vs. a walled-garden Utopia) are amplified when a new technology is introduced, but that it's actually pretty difficult to gauge how the average person will use it, or whether it will ever gain traction outside of the high-tech cognoscenti: the value proposition for "the metaverse" has still not been proven.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that with any new technology, there will always be folks who will tell you that it will either revolutionize the way we live or cause the downfall of culture/humanity/civilization, but that the technologies themselves (AR/VR/immersive computing) are fundamentally neutral.</p>
<p>IMO the concern around negative second and third-order effects that arise from a perverse incentive structure (cause by large centralized platforms "owning" the metaverse experience) is valid, but it's still way too early to tell what the competitive landscape will look like and, to my first point, I'm not sure whether the average person would even want to use something like this.</p>

<p>So then you have to ask the questions. Do we want to amplify these things? Do we need to? What is the good of it?</p>
<p>These questions are not  specifically about computing or related technologies, so any answers that allude to these are  suspect.</p>

The pitch seems to be simultaneously; "it's real", and "you can do anything", i.e. you are freed from the restrictions of physical reality, and also bound by them (as the story requires...)</p>
<p>I haven't read any of the books, but I watched the film of Ready Player One and all I could think was, if I was actually looking for a golden egg I wouldn't be physically walking on a treadmill, I'd be trawling through network packets, hexdumps etc.</p>
<p>This is how people looked for the jetpack in GTA5. To start off with they "played along" but pretty quickly, when they really wanted to know, they refused to engage with the interface the game was presenting. Ignoring what the game wanted made them more powerful.</p>
<p>I think this is what Carmack was getting at. If the Metaverse was possible, we could do it GTA style with Xbox controllers and LCD screens. The fact we have good cheap VR headsets now is an orthogonal issue.</p>

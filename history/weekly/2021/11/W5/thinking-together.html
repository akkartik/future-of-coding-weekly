I'm curious in the sense of "thinking together"   regarding this happening in the rust community: <a href="https://twitter.com/etorreborre/status/1463422189080915969?s=20"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/etorreborre/status/1463422189080915969?s=20">https://twitter.com/etorreborre/status/1463422189080915969?s=20</a> what are you throughts in it? Why is it happening  within the rust community and more general? How much are programming languages influenced in terms of communicating culture by things like the culture wars? Looking forward to your thoughts</p>

<p>That's it's kind of pointless to conjecture any useful thoughts around it given that the actual details of what happened to prompt this haven't been shared publicly. Those who are seem to mostly be using it as a soapbox to espouse some pre-established opinion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is it happening within the rust community and more general?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because squabbles over governance and control happen in every community, always have and probably always will. We're a species with a deep seated desire/need to establish social hierarchies and that shows up in every group.</p>

For example, Ruby libraries consistently choose simplicity over completeness and soundness.  Contrast with, say, Haskell where it may be hard to express what I want, but I always come away understanding what exactly is hard better.</p>

Anyone doing that? E.g Plug-in recommendations would be appreciated. Ideally I'm looking for something with a subset of similar features to what [<a href="https://twitter.com/ibdknox">Chris Granger</a>] Chris Granger did for Eve [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWAMr72VaaU">demo</a>]; Free source code ordering, ability to add some interactivity using the code itself etc, mix markdown and js. That should be pretty doable, don't you think?</p>
<p>Thing is I've got a perfect use-case for literate programming in a current project; not much code, just a few hundred LOC, but conceptually heavy. So I'm not in need of any deep magic, it's enough if Literate Programming would: (1) help me understand my own underlying model. (2) Produce something useful to others wanting to understand the code/underlying model later (without extra work on my side üôÇ ). That would be great!</p>
<p>Recommendations/ideas/experiences are super welcome!</p>

<p>With LP, you can't help but read the opening paragraph every time. so you keep refining it and its gets better, and you code backs up that mission.</p>

<p>I have a reactive unit testing library for Observablehq (@tomlarkworthy/testing). Observable has in built version history so you don;t get to add "commit description", but for things like major releases I write a change log entry in prose as part of the notebook text.</p>

<p>It seems deeply inspired by mind-maps, but also seems happy to leave the "thought space" behind pretty quickly in favor of the work-space. </p>
<p>Yes we want to see our ideas "work", but sometimes the thrill is in the ideas themselves, adjacent possibilities, the model, the schema. </p>
<p>The code, the wires, the implementation, those are often much less exciting ‚Äî we know we can make those work, they're rote.</p>
<p>Mind-map software itself has very little ambition, little automation, shockingly little creativity, which is beyond ironic.</p>
<p>On the other end, I don't really need something that compiles and runs. My mind can "compile and run" lots of things ‚Äî even given fragmented and incomplete material. It loves that, in fact.</p>
<p>I guess what I want is fewer Turing machines and more mind bicycles.</p>

<p>My quick take on what's the issue is that they take the tools they have (mostly C and C++ from what I've seen) and fix issues they have with a focus on simplicity, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/"></a><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/</a> don't seem to get enough karma there to stay in the community.</p>
<p>Also by generating usable projects and caring about actual users now and not imaginary ones in the indefinite future.</p>
<p>Is this an incentives/objectives/organization issue? or I'm just wrong? üôÇ</p>

<p>But, as a constructive reply üòâ , I am not sure that they are "doing much more for the future of coding than this community". At least because Future of Coding means so many things. This community addresses other FoC subjects. Like (for me at least!) end-user/non-experts programming which focus is actually opposite to Hand Made Network.</p>

Few thoughts from somebody who is relatively new to this community and is more on the practical side (working on my project):</p>
<ul><li><p>I love seeing some of the abstract conversations, they can be inspiring and thought provoking. They take me out of the specific problem I am working and give some new insights.</p>
</li><li><p>I don't think abstract conversations and practice exclude each other, they actually go well very together. Practice is boring without some dreaming, and dreaming starts to get disappointing when there are no results (practice).</p>
</li><li><p>from what I see, this community and Handmade don't share the mission. They are about rethinking solutions that are using a lot of layers and are inefficient, and making them from scratch to be more efficient and possibly elegant. This community on other hand is trying to make programming more accessible. In my view, that very often means opposite of Handmade - we don't care about performance, but about usability, and that often means putting one more layer at the top.</p>
</li><li><p>It seems to me there are quite a few projects on here that are being actively worked on, so I don't feel like it is all talk and no work!</p>

<p>And I feet that my work with adcraft is not yet that much aligned with FoC. For now it is just a modified Scratch, trying to build some kind of community and to figure out how to manage this kind of project. Not very much technical novelties yet.</p>

<p>As for the original topic.. despite the fact that Steve Krouse seemingly intended for this community to be a font of projects, at current it feels more like a social club. Handmade Network might be the makerspace where a certain type of industrious folk are using common tools to build nifty things; FoC, then, is the lounge where folks from all over get together to listen to algorave and discuss "big ideas".</p>
<p>It'd be cool to see more novel projects pouring out of this community, sure, but I don't think that needs to happen for this community to have value.</p>
<p>Perhaps we just have a bit of an identity crisis?</p>

<p>Returning to this subject, I've been on the Handmade Discord for a while, but I've had trouble getting into it. <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a> I had trouble following this comment of yours as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kind of the opposite happens here, the projects that are active on two minute week are either low level (mu, uCISC), done in C++ (maudio) or javascript based (instadeq, flow editor)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You said later, "not the opposite actually," so I'm curious what you meant here. I'm curious where it overlaps and is in tension with how I think about it: Handmade is about the present of software. High- vs low-level feels like a red herring here. Handmade is about existing programmers trying to tailor existing tools to their needs in often quite short-term, tactical ways. It's not clear that there's a lot of reflection or discussion of how to grow the tent.</p>
<p>Then again, it may well be that this is the way that wins out in the end. Maybe existing tools are good enough, they just need more community to coalesce around them. I'm glad somebody is exploring that branch of the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>This is a weak opinion. I haven't followed many channels on the Discord, and the project pages outside Discord feel like a maze. As a result, it's often difficult for me to know what a channel is talking about; I feel like I'm entering in the middle of a conversation. I've tried asking for links a couple of times but not had much of a response. People here seem to put more effort into being understood by new audience members.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links to Dion on <strong>#linking-together</strong>! I've often seen it mentioned but hadn't found the project page yet. Looking forward to checking it out.</p>

Both of which are important, but they‚Äôre wildly different goals with different outcomes. Trying to decide which has done more for transportation is an exercise in opinion more than anything else. It‚Äôs certainly the case that improving cars today has a much higher likelihood of a real impact, but the magnitude of discoveries that come from even a single commercially unsuccessful moon landing are incalculable. There‚Äôs a big difference between invention and innovation.  And sadly, more often than not, the inventors are not the ones who bring things to market and get wide adoption, but without them, the Steve Jobs of the world don‚Äôt have anything to sell. It is because of work from folks in communities like this one that Dion (they explicitly reference hazel) can build a sound projectional editor.</p>
<p>The demos I‚Äôve seen from Handmade so far are really just like ours. They‚Äôre are all still just vingettes of things to come, not adopted, industry changing improvements to our future. And that‚Äôs ok - progress almost always happens slowly and then suddenly. At some point, we‚Äôll see MPG improvements and if we‚Äôre lucky, we‚Äôll see Buzz Aldrin bouncing around on the moon too. üôÇ</p>

<p>[Summary: there's a link to a video of various SUPER ROUGH prototypes of a big-budget Star Wars game from early in its development. The person sharing the link adds the wry commentary: "but when indie devs pitch to publishers we need to have gameplay gifs that look like the final product"]</p>
<p>Dion lucked into the same thing I did when I posted <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1145028588715950080"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1145028588715950080">https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1145028588715950080</a> ‚Äî if you can make your thing look cool in a short gif, you'll get a ton of interest and it will spread easily because it's easy to spread.

<p>Marketing can be extremely useful. Marketing can also be a siren. It is up to each of us how we navigate that, and there isn't a single obvious answer. At least to me. Depending on what you're doing, follower count or number of views may be extremely useful. But it doesn't have to be. For me personally, the goal is to find 30 people [1] to collaborate with over the rest of my life. I started Mu because the existing stack makes it impossible for me to collaborate with anyone in my chosen style (not hemmed in by layers of the stack).</p>
<p>I try hard to be accessible to everyone, but I also have some self-awareness that the direction I'm going is not going to be an immediate fit for everyone. Seen through my lens, a "mother of all demos" is something actively to be avoided. Perhaps that's just sour grapes on my part.</p>

We had a group working on a "metazettel" project in quiet, but that lost momentum over the summer (I'll blame COVID). So, I'm now setting aside time in January to get the ball rolling on this.</p>
<p>In addition to typical wiki-esq content (pages for single ideas / references), one of the things I'd like to have in this project are curations or editorial features, sort of like Steve Krouse's "Whole Code Catalog". I'd like to build some living, ongoing curated collections of:</p>
<ul><li>FoC work throughout history by various underrepresented groups</li><li>projects by all the long-time members of this community</li><li>FoC works within various disciplines (eg: FoC in gamedev, FoC in graphic design, FoC in writing / research)</li><li>A better home for my <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex"></a><a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex">https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex</a></li><li>etc</li></ul><p>By carving out a space and norms for this sort of content, and making it something that is an extension/outgrowth of this community, it will give us a coordination point to build up the "idea packages" <a href="https://twitter.com/warianoguerra">Mariano Guerra</a> mentioned above, to workshop them openly amongst ourselves, and then eventually use them as the basis for something that could be shared widely (eg: as microsites, videos, whatever)</p>
<p>This will all take a lot of work, but it's work that can be done incrementally, it doesn't require any wheel reinvention. There are folks here who want to collaborate on something within the community, but would find it difficult to jump into someone's pet research project, so hopefully this could be an outlet for their enthusiasm.</p>

I believe there are many indie game creators and tools creators that have done this relatively recently (Pico-8, Twine, PuzzleScript, etc.).  No one on FoC (once again to my knowledge) is building tools explicitly for rapid game creation.  There isn't anyone really making a run of the mill Fantasy Console or Game Engine</p>

There are always going to be folks who are more willing to engage in building  projects and showing them off, and we provide great platforms to do so in this community, but we have to be conscious that there are just as many folks whose joy lies in the more academic or philosophical pursuits.

<p>Watching this talk helped me realize why I never really got the Felleisen paper: their notion of "expressiveness" is almost diametrically opposite what I (and, I think, most people) associate with the term.</p>
<p><a href="https://pwlconf.org/2019/shriram-krishnamurthi"></a><a href="https://pwlconf.org/2019/shriram-krishnamurthi">https://pwlconf.org/2019/shriram-krishnamurthi</a></p>
<p>As an almost trivial example, they say that a <code>for</code> loop is not more expressive than a <code>while</code> loop, because it can be rewritten with a local transform (Lisp macro). I consider it more expressive because it creates a new structure for loops that allows us to reason about updates separately from the body. Lisp macros are powerful because they allow my program to get progressively more expressive. Isn't this the normal meaning of the term? A more expressive language helps you express intent more tersely.</p>
<p>The paper is cool. But they need to get off my lawn and find a new term for themselves.

<p>Particularly when doing a retrospective, it feels like a missed opportunity to not point out the two possible meanings. (I disagree that Shriram means what I mean, just in a more precise way. The two interpretations here have little in common. Sometimes we need to contrast two Lisp macros and debate which is more expressive, more clearly conveying intention. This paper wouldn't help there.)</p>

Yeah. I agree that they're the same power. However, I wouldn't say they're the other way around. In terms of power, I was comparing <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> before.

<ul><li>keywords (e.g. 'typedef', 'int')</li><li>identifiers (e.g. 'vector', 'floor')</li><li>numbers</li><li>comments</li><li>quoted strings</li></ul><p>Additionally, I do rainbow brackets, which I think is probably the biggest bang for the buck; it makes it much easier to resolve the 'too many/too few brackets' problem in most languages.</p>
<p>Colors are based on themes, so that 'Keyword' will be different in Light vs Dark theme, for example.</p>
<p>I consider my system crude at best, but it works well enough.  Better introspection of the language using a language server would help matters....  Implementation of this stuff gets quite tricky if you want it to be fast and handle combinations of states, such as highlighting text while working with the syntax coloring.  Really, you need a layer system to prioritize the coloring of each character based on the background, syntax color, additional effects, etc.</p>

<p>Religious cultures did offer many benefits for many people. There‚Äôs excellent wisdom in ancient texts that were learned by the members of these religions. Religion offered community, education, answers to the question ‚Äòwhat is the meaning of life?‚Äô, etc. Obv, even with that, there are tradeoffs (scientific ideas were often persecuted) and even just a decade or 2 ago in Boston (where I live now), priests were protected for sexually assaulting children (in the loose name of ‚Äòreligion‚Äô). Religion got ‚Äòunbundled‚Äô, so to speak, and now many different institutions enjoy the responsibillity of satisfying these human needs</p>

<p>We‚Äôre now in the next phase of media-invention. Print has its own tradeoffs; struggles at helping you think scientifically or reason about complex systems. Print is excellent at helping you empathize with the challenges of 1 person, but doesn‚Äôt help you build a nuanced understanding of a complex system like education or politics.</p>

I'm just wondering if Postman means something specific when he talks about what was lost in religion due to print.</p>
<p>From what I've read of Postman (only Amusing Ourselves to Death, so far), he does talk about what's lost due to TV culture, from leisure to politics. And he does touch on religion too:</p>
<blockquote><p>... I am aware of the deep concern among ‚Äúestablished‚Äù Protestant religions about the tendency toward refashioning Protestant services so that they are more televisible. It is well understood at the National Council that the danger is not that religion has become the content of television shows but that television shows may become the content of religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he mentions the "Faustian bargain" in <code>tv + religion</code>, but with <code>print + religion</code>, I'm left guessing. I wonder if he mentions that in some other work.</p>

<blockquote><p>Religion was what held pre-modern societies together. [...] Inductive science, based on systematic doubt, cannot replace this function.Interesting... Science was needed to understand the truth about the world, but was never meant to replace religion. This suggests maybe religions need to adapt and stop assuming the function of science like they used to? Creating these science-compatible religions might stop their decline, assuming what's left after dropping fancyful superstition has enough value.</p>

The IETF's mission is to make the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet. IETF standards are built on the combined engineering judgement of participants, including individuals from academia and network operators, router vendors and open source projects. Success is measured by the extent that the protocols and practices developed in the IETF is used to make the Internet work better.</code></pre></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-11-21T16:56:04.068Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jack Rusher</span> <a href="#2020-11-21T16:56:04.068Z" class="date">2020-11-21 16:56:04</a> <div class="message">

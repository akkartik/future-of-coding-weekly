It occurs to me that a super-useful addition here would be to add a second flame graph for the audio thread.  I will think about it.

<p>Here's my update about the progress that I made last weekend. Sometime ago I started working on <a href="https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner"></a><a href="https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner">https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner</a> , which is library to parse and execute expressions</p>
<p>with support for named variables. This weekend I added support for more operators like &amp; | % &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; and so on.</p>
<p>This allows me to extend my tixy land implementation and it is now more in line with the original. But that's not the end goal offcourse.</p>
<p>I want for example to be able to use this expressionrunner for visibility conditions of form fields (in the form-nodes, which is also a new feature) but also in</p>
<p>my "mini excel"-data-grid node as formulas to reference cells (I've already got the basis covered).</p>

<p>Together with Damien Seguin and <strong>@Nick Nikolov</strong> we have been building a node-based creative-coding tool at&nbsp;<a href="http://variable.io"></a><a href="http://variable.io">http://variable.io</a> that is JavaScript based and npm friendly: Nodes.</p>
<p>We have used it for all our creative coding, generative art and datavis projects for the last 3 years and it‚Äôs really changed how we think with code. If you are interested in knowing more and trying it out, we just shared an open beta today for everyone:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nodes_io/status/1328666419890954241"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/nodes_io/status/1328666419890954241">https://twitter.com/nodes_io/status/1328666419890954241</a></p>
<p>You can download it on our website:&nbsp;<a href="https://nodes.io/"></a><a href="https://nodes.io/">https://nodes.io/</a></p>
<p>--- end of announcement üôÇ</p>
<p>Happy to engage in any kind of discussion from ‚ÄúWhy on earth JS?‚Äù to ‚ÄúDid you find unidirectional data flow useful or troublesome?‚Äù or even help getting started.</p>

<p>for those who don't yet know, brother and I are working on <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev"></a><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a> - a DSL (domain specific language) for building web apps with as little boilerplate as possible. It is open-source and integrates with React/Node.js/Prisma.</p>
<p>Main hypothesis of the experiment: What if web framework was a DSL (we are not the first ones to try this!)?</p>
<p>About half a year ago I posted a prototype here, and now we have released an Alpha! It is still very early, but we have docs, it can be properly installed, and you can build an app (though it still misses many important features).</p>
<p>Goal of the project and our focus is to make developing web apps as easy as possible, while still being flexible enough to be used for real projects in production. In that sense, I think it should be an ok fit for FoC, since it should allow developers who are not very experienced in web development to build a full-stack production-ready web app by themselves. It does add one more layer of abstraction, but the goal is to reduce knowledge barrier.</p>
<p>Bigger, crazier vision is to one day also build a no-code visual editor on top of Wasp, which would allow non-developers to participate alongside developers. We are thinking this could work very good with Wasp since it is declarative, and if we manage to capture big portion of web app functionality in this declarative code, it could be easier to build such editor on top.</p>
<p>When using Wasp, you write code in Wasp (declarative) and Javascript together.</p>
<p>Compiler implemented in Haskell compiles/transpiles the source code of Wasp project into a human-readable JS based web app (which you don't care about unless you decide to eject -&gt; take the code and leave Wasp).</p>
<p>We started working on Wasp about a year ago, first as a side project and then full time (we are bootstraping), and we are excited to see how far we can get with the whole concept! Right now we are trying to get first testers and contributors (actually got our first contributor couple of days ago wohooo!), while we also keep developing Wasp.</p>

One thing I have found out as these sort of websites grow in complexity is that it becomes really hard to reason about how components are wired together. Like if you have n number of pages referring m different components, you have n * m different components getting referred and with each layer of recursion on inclusion and cross referencing this really becomes an unwieldly graph. Have you thought about any way to control this kind of complexity? Curious because it is a problem I‚Äôm trying to reason about and solve as it reappears in many software engineering contexts.</p>
<p>Another way I might frame is that, have you thought of any visual ways to represent the dependency graph of the components that the compiler weaves.</p>

We haven't thought about that specific problem so far, we are now more focusing on the general "overview" logic, gluing stuff together in the app.</p>
<p>Regarding view logic, we are sticking with React, which I didn't feel much problems with so far -&gt; it composes really nicely and it is very simple. Hard part is state management, especially using server state on the client, so that is something we are focusing more on (via Queries/Actions).</p>
<p>Regarding having a graph of visual components, I can imagine it being complicated in some apps (although I would expect it to look more or less like a tree, in most cases), but how does that manifest as a problem when writing a project? If each, let's say React component, has clearly defined responsibilities, it does not matter where it is used, right? I mean, its usage in various places should not increase complexity.</p>

It is shown as continuous here, but really it is discrete; it is somewhat easier to visualise like this I think.  The graph goes more red the closer the audio thread comes to the max time slice it is given to generate audio.  The image here shows a brief bottleneck which I've zoomed into in the bottom of the profiler.  You can see that the yellow 'Audio' region is much bigger for this particular frame, compared to the next ones.  Although I don't have instrumentation for it yet, I believe this is coinciding with the arrival of the first notes into the graph - since a known problem is that some memory allocation is done at this point on the first run (and this particular stress test is playing many notes all at once).  Just something I know I need to get around to fixing. I'm satisfied the profiler is useful enough to leave alone for now, and move onto other things.</p>

<p>Yep! The schematic system can provide arbitrary annotations for the nodes and wires. In this case it's showing the code of the process that runs on click. We're still experimenting with the visuals here, so that should be more clear in time.</p>

<p>While definitely different in flavor. It does remind me a bit of the eve prototype you talked about raising on. Where you had basically executable specifications (link at bottom). I'm curious what you did differently here that made you like this more.</p>
<p>It seems from the description there is no datalog going on. So maybe getting rid of the unification like semantics was the key? Definitely excited to see more examples and play with it in the future.</p>

That change makes actually using these two things wildly different. As an example, we sat down to write a few larger programs, one of which was an implementation of the board game terraforming mars.

Datalog scatters logic all over the place and we never could really figure out good way to help you answer the question ‚Äúwhat is this doing?‚Äù But we can with imperative English. For one, it‚Äôs largely self-summarizing, but even more importantly you are constructing intentional lines of execution rather than accidental ones. With some clever analysis and tooling on top, we can take advantage of that to tell you at any point in the system what‚Äôs important. What are the effects of what I‚Äôm looking at right now? If I change this what else will change? While it‚Äôs technically possible to know that in a datalog program, it‚Äôs hard to explain it to the user programmatically because there‚Äôs nothing that ties it together. Processes fix that for us and so our tools can do some really awesome things.</p>

Concepts are modeled as parts and you slot those into gadgets, which naturally turns monolithic specifications into small composable ones. To give an example, we could create a part for ‚Äúwet‚Äù that has some specific behavior attached to it and then give that to any arbitrary thing in the system. This makes it truly behave like natural language where we don‚Äôt need to understand everything about ‚Äúwet.‚Äù We can just take a dog and add the wet part to it.</p>

I am going to be really interested to see this play out. It seems like there is an interesting full circle going on here with the ECS system in light table (with some various obvious differences). But also interesting how you went from functional (aurora), to logical (eve), and now to imperative.</p>
<p>Definitely going to be interested to see how those twists and how the type system comes into play. I love the usage of a board game as an example. Seems like the right level of complexity, with clarity because it becomes really a translation problem. Can't wait to see more.</p>

<p>Card games make a good test case for imperative/statey constructs.  Because the primary hand/turn/round flow of game is interrupted by players simultaneously inspecting their cards and occasionally interrupting each other.  In fact, Nerts <a href="https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/how-to-play/nerts-game-rules"></a><a href="https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/how-to-play/nerts-game-rules">https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/how-to-play/nerts-game-rules</a> is probably the best possible example.  Start with solitaire ‚Äî good old fashioned.  Now, instead of each player having their own four foundations, the foundations are shared.  Once you put out an ace of spades, I can play a two of spades on that.  There you go Chris.  Show that demo: solitaire is converted into Nerts in five minutes.  Collect Series A and a million FoC fans at once.</p>

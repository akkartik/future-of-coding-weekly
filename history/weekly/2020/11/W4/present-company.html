It occurs to me that I've only owned laptops all my life, and the pandemic is a great opportunity for me to switch to more hackable desktops. And switching to ARM may reduce the energy barrier for later forking Mu to it.</p>

They just seem intrinsically more open and moddable. But yes, RPi was on my mind in considering ARM.</p>

Sorry! That's what I get for reading too fast and jumping to comment. ðŸ˜³</p>
<p>I don't know of many classical desktop tower setups that are ARM based in the consumer space. I think Huawei was releasing one for the Chinese market recently?</p>
<p>ARM is a bit niche in the classical desktop market unfortunately. x86 seems to have a monopoly there... The motherboard manufacturers don't have any incentive to make ARM compatible desktop boards.</p>
<p>There is the new Apple Desktop ARM machines that are coming soon, but something tells me that is not what you had in mind in terms of openness or moddability.</p>

It still has the GPIO pins exposed to allow for some potentially cool hackability.</p>

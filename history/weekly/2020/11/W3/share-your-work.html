Using my own adacraft tool (in that case nearly no special adacraft features has been used, so one can do the same with Scratch).

<p>Not sure it has the same spirit as tixy.land though. Because the original idea is to implement the algorithm with a simple formula as a text expression in less than 32 characters, and in my project the formula is programmed with blocks with no limit. But, hey, it was fun to do it!</p>
<p>And with this project I also wanted to explore how to organize and document block programming code √† la Scratch to make it more expressive.</p>

A good source of inspiration was Go's Gio library. One idea I've stolen is that drawing operations are not immediately applied but are stored first, so you can apply transformations after the fact. In particular, this allows implementing automatic layout with constraints.

For comparison, here's a single frame of the UI on a release build.  The UI is locked at 60fps; so can't go faster than that, but you can also see a couple of audio frames on this screenshot (which don't necessarily align inside frames), along with the FFT thread at the bottom.</p>
<p>Here 512 frames of audio is being generated in about 1.2ms - this is the equivalent of about 11ms of audio.  Although I keep an eye on this stuff, and build things sensibly to avoid bottlenecks, I haven't actually spent too much time optimising anything yet.  But it's good to know there is headroom.</p>
<p>I also forgot to mention in the video that one of the main things the profiler brings to the table is debugging; it already showed me a place where I'm doing unexpected work, and a mutex lock that should not be happening.   For the small effort it took to build this feature, I think it was well worth it.</p>

Though I can imagine other uses for it.  You could possibly imagine a simplified version which shows the live coder which parts of their performance are taking the most time.  That's probably just looking for a hammer now I've got the nails though ;)</p>
<p>Also, I think I will add frame candles so you can see spikes in performance and indications of memory allocations.  I'll put these things in as I need them.</p>
<p>I looked for an ImGui profiler before doing this one; I found  one that didn't handle threads very well, or profile events that spanned frames.  I found another that was a butchered version of the first one, with better UI but worse profiling.  In the end, this only took a few hours over the course of a week to do; I'm pleased I put in the effort.  My version will be OS in a week or so when I've finished tweaking it and pushed it to my shared library.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming this is fast, but for my purposes it is 'fast enough' üôÇ It allocates all the memory up front, and records simple time stamps, so overhead is fairly decent, which is all I need.</p>

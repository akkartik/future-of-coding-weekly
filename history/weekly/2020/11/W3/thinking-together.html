I've long asked myself how to better manage refactoring from a dynamic perspective ‚Äî as opposed to adding static features to a dynamic language.  Since a refactor wants to be behaviorally invariant (to some degree), why not keep track of the behavior?</p>
<p>Consider the case of changing a parameter type.  If the normal brain dynamic way is to make the change and see what tests break, then the galaxy brain dynamic way would be to show all the places where code needs to change from having remembered (traced) all the times the function is called in practice.  Using traces in this way feels a lot like static analysis and loops around when you switch from concrete traces to more symbolic/partial kind of evaluation.  You find yourself back in familiar static typing territory when the symbolic evaluation is more limited.</p>

I often see macros as a way to "add your own user defined compiler stage." There are many examples of lisp macros that try to optimize code. <a href="https://youtu.be/8FoAxasNssA"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/8FoAxasNssA">https://youtu.be/8FoAxasNssA</a> of C++ templates being used to generate optimized shader code depending on the compile target.</p>
<p>To be a shill for my favorite hobby lang for a bit: Nim is interesting on this topic. Nim has lisp style macros, and liberally uses high level rewrite passes to generate optimized code. For example, Nim has the concept of an <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators"></a><a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators">https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators</a>, which gives you convenient python style iterator syntax, but rewrites the code into a more optimal for loop. <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/asyncdispatch.html"></a><a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/asyncdispatch.html">https://nim-lang.org/docs/asyncdispatch.html</a> in Nim is entirely built as a macro library. But, as interesting as those examples are, any language with a macro system can accomplish something similar in theory.</p>
<p>What is interesting about Nim is that it is purely a "compiler front end" to use compiler terminology. Nim does not produce assembly language. It produces C code that can then be fed into any C compiler. This means the output is fairly high level, and while it's not "pretty" or  "elegant", it's inspectable! You can read it and understand what is going on.</p>

The analogy I use is that what we call ‚Äòpersonal computing‚Äô is really restaurant made food delivered to our homes very quickly (vs true personal cooking where I can make the food I want at home using tools that are personal-human-scale).</p>
<p>The common answers to centralized computing / centralized internet like handwaving ‚Äòdecentralized‚Äô or ‚Äòp2p‚Äô or ‚Äòopen source / libre‚Äô I strongly feel are WORSE options for most people (minus the philosophy). That‚Äôs like taking a restaurant kitchen &amp; food-assembly-line and putting it on every street corner for the neighborhood to run (for most people this is worse than a regular restaurant). (the analogy isn‚Äôt perfect I know!) Personal, home cooking is fundamentally different than restaurant made food in qualitative ways that make it appealing in its own right and not let people get caught up in their ‚Äòresistance‚Äô of centralized restaurants.</p>
<p>The other great insight from food industry is that centralized food creation and personalized food creation can co-exist just fine, and people can move between both systems as they please.</p>

<p>Perhaps predictably, I'd push back on this. The tech we have ready is for running restaurants. We have to recreate it for the equivalent of home cooking. From a standing start. In the face of entrenched competition. Without a huge centralized funding source. Thinking of it as purely a UX problem is doomed, I think. Existing tech assumes reliable funding.</p>

<p>Some other directions for the analogy, taking into account some innovations in food technology/media:</p>
<ul><li>More powerful home equipment packaged in consumer friendly ways eg, slow cooker, sous vide machine, ninja food blenders. On a socio-technical level, I can see the parallel elistism of using such tools by ‚Äúproper‚Äù chefs, similar to C++ programmers looking at Unity, or professional programmers looking at no-code tools.</li><li>Recipe boxes eg, gousto, mindful chef. Meet halfway with the user so they still need to cook, but provide the ingredients and recipes to them to guide them. Maybe no-code with tutorials/sharing community is going in this direction</li><li>Masterchef/British Bake off/Youtube videos - it‚Äôs quite easy to be inspired by others making food, and it‚Äôs just pure entertaining! I‚Äôm not sure watching a code editor/terminal on twitch will be very entertaining to someone who does not program. There‚Äôs this thing with game design, where some games are fun to watch, as well as play (sometimes more so). Making software can be quite solitary a lot of times. I guess dynamic land tackles this by having a ‚Äúlocal-multiplayer‚Äù feel to it.

<p>It seems deeply inspired by mind-maps, but also seems happy to leave the "thought space" behind pretty quickly in favor of the work-space. </p>
<p>Yes we want to see our ideas "work", but sometimes the thrill is in the ideas themselves, adjacent possibilities, the model, the schema. </p>
<p>The code, the wires, the implementation, those are often much less exciting ‚Äî we know we can make those work, they're rote.</p>
<p>Mind-map software itself has very little ambition, little automation, shockingly little creativity, which is beyond ironic.</p>
<p>On the other end, I don't really need something that compiles and runs. My mind can "compile and run" lots of things ‚Äî even given fragmented and incomplete material. It loves that, in fact.</p>
<p>I guess what I want is fewer Turing machines and more mind bicycles.</p>

<p>The interaction would be about the node graph itself - rather than me doing everything to the node graph to produce an effect I already understand</p>
<p>That's really the thought exercise - not using a node-graph to program, but a node-graph to explore, and in the nature of node-graph qua mind-map - maybe something like a node-quine?</p>

<ul><li>Consider what the "assembly language" of building and navigating a graph would be - now presume that those are the very same behaviors that you give to the running machine - for instance, a script where touching a node runs the NAVIGATE and then BRANCH steps - you play with those until you start producing useful new iterations of the mind-map - the most basic action might be JUMP/GOTO to a known node, because it's a part of the mind-map you always want to look at - advanced actions might use neural-network-lite scoring to try to discover a useful node to bring into the view</li><li>There is probably a Hypercard-like toggle between "use" and "edit" modes</li></ul><p>It feels like I've used a node-based environment like this, but not one where it considered itself as a mind-map, trying to work in a conceptual space</p>

I can highly recommend Object Thinking by David West. He takes a radical different (can‚Äôt call it new, being written in 2004 ;-) approach how to look at software development. Making it much more human centred than the title might suggest.</p>

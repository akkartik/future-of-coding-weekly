<p>I tweeted a little thread about this as a beacon for interested people to find me and to start a discussion (and perhaps even collaboration?).</p>
<p>Would greatly appreciate if you helped spread the word to people you know who might be interested. 🙏</p>

At one point I thought I shouldn't do this because I want to do his work justice.</p>
<p>The only book I have read from Christopher Alexander is Notes on the Synthesis of Form. And that is one book I keep revisiting even after years of reading it because it was such a dense book even when it is low on page count. That is one of those life changing books of mine that hinted me to the idea that synergies from different domains could be brought into practices like design/engineering.</p>
<p>Re: geometry, I think Christopher Alexander's style is much more in line with that of Frank Lloyd Wright. Both of them have this sort of geometric sense which aligns greatly with nature. So to point out what I mean by the bouba style, I think Ernst Haeckel's work would be exemplary. There's this sort of morphogenetic unfolding nature to whole of Alexander's ouevre which I find culminates in him identifying those 15 patterns.</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, those 15 patterns are a distillation of what he find "animating"/life giving in nature. This is one of the reasons I think it would be injustice if I straight away jump into animating them without imbibing his (dense) context. What do you think?</p>

What I'd really like to do though, is to have a broader discussion with you specifically about the connections I see between Alexander's theory as described in Nature of Order and the mathematical work you do. I think that would be much easier in a synchronous fashion. Would you be interested in having a video chat about that in the near future?</p>

I'll let everybody here know as soon as I have a better idea of what that could look like.</p>

<p>Since I was feeling to give an interpretation of the kind of aesthetic and ideas I have I created this Figma document on the Strong Centers idea of Christopher Alexander: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/BhsccIVN4ZOAo37s6zCKev/Geometry-of-Life?node-id=0%3A1"></a><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/BhsccIVN4ZOAo37s6zCKev/Geometry-of-Life?node-id=0%3A1">https://www.figma.com/file/BhsccIVN4ZOAo37s6zCKev/Geometry-of-Life?node-id=0%3A1</a></p>

If I was asked to articulate what it means, I am thinking that things emerge from an original center and they then go on to act as their own centers and finally coming back to the source. This is the kind of idea I had in mind when I think about Alexander’s work.</p>
<p>I am resorting to that sort of simple shapes and geometric interpretation a) because my library can't do morphogenetic stuff yet, b) I think his work is a distillation of the very essence of what he find under the varied phenomena of life. So I think it would ultimately be something parsimonious.</p>
<p>So I am thinking of 15 different animations like this composed of simple geometric primitives but then all these animations would be able to transition from one to the other seamlessly because they form a cohesive whole. Having simple shapes and trajectories also helps in that respect.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of this aesthetically and as giving a form to Alexander’s ideas.</p>

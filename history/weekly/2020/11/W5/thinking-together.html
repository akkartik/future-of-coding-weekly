<p>If you love Hofstadter‚Äôs work I highly recommend you look into Louis Kauffman‚Äôs video. It has a math slant but it is illuminating.</p>

<p>Also: ‚ÄúDeleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation‚Äù is pretty much in line with what I am trying to understand here by saying braids/heterarchy.</p>

Based on reviews, it's all about the OOP and Smalltalk philosophy of programming. I would instead be interested in reading a hypothetical book called Value Thinking, about a non-formalist, human-centred approach to pure functional programming. The first 30 years of FP research resulted in some lovely, simple, dynamically typed FP languages that could be summarized in a few pages of text. Then Haskell happened, and now FP has morphed into this monstrously complex subject that is all about formalism, higher order type theory and category theory. One way of looking at my research is: FP for humans. My interest in Alexander comes from this perspective. So I'm looking to see if David West has ideas I can repurpose for this.</p>

He is writing a book called "The Design of Living Systems" which sounds very Alexander-inspired (no summary is provided, just the title). The newer book "Design Thinking" also looks very Alexander inspired--table of contents mentions living systems, form, fit and unfolding. This book is also not available yet. However, there are online papers and videos, including "Conversations with Alexander". So I'm going to dive in now.</p>

Object Thinking is about us humans seeing and perceiving things as belonging to a certain class of things. These things having the expected/appropriate behaviour. It happens that Smalltalk accommodates for this behavioural approach by not being strictly typed and seeing everything as an object. As long as an object responds to a message send (and performs the requested behaviour), it is behavioural complete.</p>

<p>So if you treat the grid as a sequence (cells instead of characters, using row width instead of line length, and having nth element at  Y * Width + X), perhaps one of the sequence diffs algos could yields better results than the others?</p>

<p>In this case the problem I'm working on is coming up with a reasonable representation of the ARM ISA. ARM binary operators all support one immediate operand that must fit in 12 bits. However the 12 bits are used in a strange way, starting with 8 bits and then using the remaining 4 to determine how to rotate it. The recommended "universal assembly language" for ARM is to just provide constants and let the toolchain give you errors like:</p>
<pre><code>A1510E:Immediate 0x&lt;imm&gt; cannot be represented by 0-255 and a rotation</code></pre><p>(<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100074/0612/assembler-errors-and-warnings/list-of-the-armasm-error-and-warning-messages"></a><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100074/0612/assembler-errors-and-warnings/list-of-the-armasm-error-and-warning-messages">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100074/0612/assembler-errors-and-warnings/list-of-the-armasm-error-and-warning-messages</a>)</p>
<p>This seems pretty lousy. I'd prefer something that's more "correct by construction", that's not one of these:</p>
<pre><code>ADD Rd, Rn, 0xff, 4

ADD Rd, Rn, rotate_left(0xff, 4)</code></pre><p>(I'm focusing on immediates just to simplify exposition. Making the second operand register-based opens up a larger can of worms.)</p>
<p>Tl;dr - There is nothing "reduced" about this RISC intruction set.</p>

<p>But it only goes so far.</p>
<p>If I write a program in Unix using Java or Python, can I reuse the Unix &gt; <code>sort</code>&gt;  to sort an array of items inside my program? Of course not, what an improper question!

<p>From the inventor of shells:</p>
<blockquote><p>I felt that commands should be usable as library subroutines, or vice versa. This stemmed from my practice of writing CTSS [OS] commands in MAD, a simplified Algol-like language. It was much faster and the code was more maintainable than IBM 7094 assembly code. Since I needed MAD-friendly subroutine calls to access CTSS primitives, I wrote in assembly code a battery of interface subroutines, which very often mimicked CTSS basic command functions. I felt it was an awkward duplication of effort. However, I did not go further in the context of CTSS.</p>

<p>I wanted to add a REPL so I used prompt-toolkit. But then it occurred to me I should also accept the repl commands as command line parameters. I also wanted to be able to trigger these RPC commands from VS Code.</p>
<p>I think the answer is a machine readable spec and code generation. That would assist with:</p>
<ul><li>Writing boilerplate server and client code</li><li>Generating a REPL and CLI parser</li><li>Calling the API from any other place (like a VS Code plugin!)</li></ul><p>Without a spec, I would just have to write all these API clients by hand.</p>
<p>since I'm thinking RDF for this spec, it should be relatively easy to express composability: send the result of executing this command as input of this other command.</p>
<p>My use case is HTTP but seems like a specific case of IPC</p>
<p>Perhaps I could bypass the REPL altogether by integrating deeply with my shell, providing completions, etc.</p>

They lived. They died." If I had to do a similar distillation for programming, it might be: "People tried to solve problems. The problems turned out to be more difficult than expected. People came slowly to terms with how difficult they were."</p>
<p>Here's Maurice Wilkes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent [doing this].I've been grinding my wheels for the past week because I've been reading about how to print floating-point numbers in decimal. Absurdly, ridiculously difficult as it is, the time has gone less in figuring out how to do it and more in coming to terms with the irreducible difficulty of it. No, this shortcut doesn't work. No, we can't avoid bignum support. And on and on. No, reading this one more research paper isn't going to make the problem magically simpler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OP seems similar. Yes, it's actually not that hard to reuse code between shell scripts and standard libraries. All you have to do is specify for every function call:</p>
<ul><li><p>Where to look for the function. (Is it a source file? A dynamic library somewhere in the path? A database? A registry somewhere online?)</p>
</li><li><p>How to look for the function in that source. (An address in RAM? A mangled name? A URL? A file handle?)</p>
</li><li><p>Where to look for each input, and how to look for it. (An address in RAM? A file handle to load lines asynchronously from? How to unmarshall?)</p>
</li><li><p>Where the computation must run. (Same process? A new child sharing nothing? A threadpool? A coroutine? Some computer on the internet?)</p>
</li><li><p>Where to send each output. (To a register? Memory location? In-memory FIFO? File system? Database table? API endpoint on some server on the internet?)</p>
</li></ul><p>Given the infinite detail of reality (<a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail"></a><a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</a>), each of these questions can be answered with arbitrary, Turing-complete code. Still, totally doable. You just have to be willing to be verbose. At every single call site.</p>
<p>No? Well, if you aren't willing to be verbose, by Shannon's law of entropy you have to trade off flexibility for concision. Live within the life-boat of a shell script, and it will impose the standard policy called, "<code>execve()</code> all the things". Live within the life-boat of a single language, and it will impose the standard policy called, "push args on the stack and call." Or something like that.</p>
<p>It's certainly possible to explore other points on this spectrum. For example it might be quite ergonomic to unbundle an OS to the point that any synchronous function call <code>foo()</code> forks a process in an isolated address space and receives its inputs asynchronously over a channel simply by calling it as <code>foo!()</code> (or <code>spawn</code>, or <code>go</code>, in a maze of subtle differences in semantics). But it seems clear you have to accept a limited menu of choices. Languages that share this menu can interoperate. Languages that make distinct choices will have to "be told again." Regardless of what you choose, I submit that having to specify the algorithm again is not that big a deal next to these problems of namespace management, mutable stores and marshalling/unmarshalling. Computation is always the easiest part of any non-trivial program.</p>

It comes very close to what you are describing. Each "function" is available at the "shell" (they call it something else, I think "listener"?). When you invoke a function from the listener, it does have autocomplete. E.g. if it accepts a file, all the filenames on the screen will "light up" and become clickable. This works because fundamentally it is not dumping streams of text on a tty, but attaching presentation objects on the screen - so each visible presentation is linked to the backing object and its type is available to the system. There are some details in this short demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4-YnLpLgtk"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4-YnLpLgtk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4-YnLpLgtk</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Funnily I kind of agree with Kartik but only while we stick to the current models of abstraction.</p>
<p>I'm going to use the following analogy to describe how I think about this. Imagine we are all "electronics people" making circuit boards with LEDs, batteries, wires, switches etc. We send signals around encoded as voltage-on-wire or even FM. Note that voltage-on-wire serves a higher purpose (e.g. a specific voltage on a line may represent the "turn this light on" signal). We create  wired-ports/FM transmitters/recievers to hook up multiple such gizmos together. Unfortunately we all use different conventions for how the voltage levels or FM bands correspond to the the signals we share. So most of our integration work is spent building adapters - the simple ones might just step up/down the voltage. The complex ones may receive a signal encoded as FM and re-encode the same signal as voltage-on-wire, or even re-transmit it on another FM band. There's nothing wrong with this because this is reality.</p>
<p>OTOH, we can also think of making things better, or even doing something  different. Here, and this is key, I think there are two broad paths:</p>
<ul><li>Standardize. If everyone uses 5V and the same FM band and the same "encoding" of the shared signals, we can more easily plug things with each other. We're still electronics people, doing mostly the same thing, but better and easier.</li><li>A new level of abstraction. Say we completely stop thinking about voltages and think in a new level of abstraction called "bytes". This is the idea of software. I'd say we're now doing a fundamentally different thing - we now are "software people" and no longer electronics people - because we are absolved of concerns about voltages and such things. The voltage didn't disappear, but don't matter directly to us. In fact many different physical contraptions may use very different physical mechanisms to represent the same bytes, but from our abstraction level, we still think of those disparate systems through a unified model of "bytes".</li></ul><p>Now the next chapter.. bytes are themselves problematic in ways that resemble voltage and FM band mismatches. The thing is bytes are used to represent "higher purpose" signals and messages that we send around - so encoding matters, again. The first approach is "standardize the encodings". This is very popular (cue this history of byte formats). But is there a second approach which would make bytes irrelevant to us? What are the new concepts we would think and design in? We may end up with many different byte level encodings for the same messages we send around but we will have a new unified model of design across all of them. We will no longer be "bytes people", so what will we be? (BTW, eventually we could forego bytes completely in some cases and map directly to voltage or other physical representations.)</p>

<p>I could just as correctly say "designing circuits or radio frequencies is just the nature of the problem". Yet in decades of building systems that transmit information I have never once had to design the mapping of information to radio frequencies. Yet I have often designed (or reckoned with) the mapping of information to bits. You could standardize on a concept higher level than bits of course, (one example is something based on "symbols"). In fact we always work with higher levels within PLs or frameworks. Yet the OS and networks stop at giving us support for bits.</p>

With hardware the encodings tend to be fixed. With software we can look at standardizing the bare minimum and leveraging its reconfigurability. For instance instead of standardizing "encodings" we could standardize "encoding grammar" which are pre-shared, but any real encodings can just be defined using this grammar and sent on the wire. Any receiver can then generate encoder/decoder on the fly. This doesn't do away with bits but encapsulates them in a way.</p>

Maybe a total language depending on your definition. I mean, the idea is pretty close to what I want to do/see, but even these "grammars" have to be encoded to be shared, and standardizing that encoding won't be any easier than the others.</p>
<p>I think of this as "encoding" vs "intent". Intent is the human purpose for whatever the system is supposed to do. We would really like to specify everything in terms of intent, both messages and programs, but intent is inherently non-physical (unless you want to talk about neurology). You can't standardize intent, or transmit it. I don't believe you can really get higher-level than "arranging bits" without confronting this non-physicality.</p>
<p>My design goals, as far as I've nailed them down, revolve in large part around precisely capturing intent, in particular, avoiding encoding things that are not intended but merely side effects of the encoding a user is using to convey their intent to a computer. One of my catchphrases is "as specific as desired", something I've thought about since I first felt straitjacketed by a mind-mapping app. Implicit ordering and implicit dependencies are quite pernicious, e.g. a supposedly unordered map that is nevertheless processed in order and allows/requires you to make assumptions based on that order. (Notably, bit strings are always ordered, which in a way is the fundamental obstacle.)</p>
<p>I've gotten as far as "make all dependencies explicit and optional (including ordering)" and "define things by the effects (in the sense of I/O!) they produce". What form of communication your intent produces, or whether it results in native code, is a matter of encoding, to be specified independently; as I (and Emmanuel I guess) said, the OS's job. Details are WIP. :-/</p>

<p>I don't believe you can really get higher-level than "arranging bits" without confronting this non-physicality.If you're saying that irrespective of the encoding, the machines can only hold signifiers and all mechanisms in the end amount to just transmitting arbitrary symbols (bits are just a sequence of symbols "1", "0") I must agree. But consider that we spend a lot of effort designing and manually implementing the mapping between multiple vocabularies of such symbols - all of which are entirely in the machine. So there is the possibility of removing this extra work.

<p>Perhaps the closest thing to a disagreement is this: it would be more precise to say that we're only doing the work once, rather than not doing it at all (and we want to let a compiler handle the details of hooking up encodings to business logic). Probably this is already what you were thinking, but I like to be explicit that the essential complexity is still there.</p>
<p>I think we should keep in mind that any "solution" to this problem of lots of encodings needs to be imagined in a world that still seethes with conflicting formats and protocols. Even besides the mess of existing formats that have zero chance of going away, different encodings have different useful properties, notably performance under various queries (also space efficiency, error resilience, etc). You wouldn't try to back a relational database with the same encoding you send over a network. I'm looking for a tool to navigate chaos more than tame it (at least in a global standard sense).</p>

<p>I am annoyed with file path issues when building typescript. When I try to build the same exact files with tsc, webpack, jest, or yarn, I get 4 different results.</p>
<p>Are there any languages out there where a file is a function that takes parameters which are the paths to its imports? Where you don't include a file, but call it? Built-in dependency injection at the build level?</p>
<p>ie:</p>
<p><code>// main.foo</code></p>
<p><code>printLib = printLib ?? "a_default_value_for_print.foo_import"</code></p>
<p><code>printLib.print "hello world"</code></p>
<p><code>// project.build</code></p>
<p><code>main.foo(printLib = "print.foo")</code></p>

<p>There is no import statement or hard linked external dependencies. Modules are just top level classes you instantiate and pass in the deps. See <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf"></a><a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf</a></p>

For example, ShapeLibrary requires utility classes such as List, defined by the standard collections library. In the absence of a global namespace, there is no way to refer to a class such as List directly. Instead, we have defined a slot named List inside ShapeLibrary. The slot declarations used in figure 2 differ slightly from our earlier examples. Here, slot initialization uses = rather than ::=. The use of = signifies that these are immutable slots, that will not be changed after they are initialized. No setter methods are generated for immutable slots, thus enforcing immutability. When ShapeLibrary is instantiated, it expects an object representing the underlying platform as an argument to its factory method usingPlatform:. This object will be the value of the factory method‚Äôs formal parameter platform. During the initialization of the module, the slot List will be initialized via the expression platform collections List. This sends the message collections to platform, presumably returning an object representing an instance of the platform‚Äôs collection library. This object then responds to the message List, returning the desired class. The class is stored in the slot, and is available to code within the module definition via the slot‚Äôs getter method. The slot definition of List fills the role of an import statement, as do those of Error and Point. Note that the parameters to the factory method are only in scope within the instance initializer. The programmer must take explicit action to make (parts of) them available to the rest of the module. The preferred idiom is to extract individual classes and store them in slots, as shown here. It is then possible to determine the module‚Äôs external dependencies at a glance, by looking at the instance initializer. Encouraging this idiom is the prime motivation for restricting the scope of the factory arguments to the initializer"</p>

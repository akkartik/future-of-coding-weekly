<p>for those who don't yet know, brother and I are working on <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev"></a><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a> - a DSL (domain specific language) for building web apps with as little boilerplate as possible. It is open-source and integrates with React/Node.js/Prisma.</p>
<p>Main hypothesis of the experiment: What if web framework was a DSL (we are not the first ones to try this!)?</p>
<p>About half a year ago I posted a prototype here, and now we have released an Alpha! It is still very early, but we have docs, it can be properly installed, and you can build an app (though it still misses many important features).</p>
<p>Goal of the project and our focus is to make developing web apps as easy as possible, while still being flexible enough to be used for real projects in production. In that sense, I think it should be an ok fit for FoC, since it should allow developers who are not very experienced in web development to build a full-stack production-ready web app by themselves. It does add one more layer of abstraction, but the goal is to reduce knowledge barrier.</p>
<p>Bigger, crazier vision is to one day also build a no-code visual editor on top of Wasp, which would allow non-developers to participate alongside developers. We are thinking this could work very good with Wasp since it is declarative, and if we manage to capture big portion of web app functionality in this declarative code, it could be easier to build such editor on top.</p>
<p>When using Wasp, you write code in Wasp (declarative) and Javascript together.</p>
<p>Compiler implemented in Haskell compiles/transpiles the source code of Wasp project into a human-readable JS based web app (which you don't care about unless you decide to eject -&gt; take the code and leave Wasp).</p>
<p>We started working on Wasp about a year ago, first as a side project and then full time (we are bootstraping), and we are excited to see how far we can get with the whole concept! Right now we are trying to get first testers and contributors (actually got our first contributor couple of days ago wohooo!), while we also keep developing Wasp.</p>

The problem I was trying to get at is that when the hierarchies start forming, things become really hard to instrument without reaching in through a lot of levels. Like there would be a need to put data in and take it out by going through a lot of cycles. That aspect also spawns this other related idea that things will become polymorphic in the presence of particular contexts. These two then gets braided together and it becomes a bit too hard to instrument with text based programming. I‚Äôm probably not making myself particularly clear there unless you have bumped into the problem.</p>
<p>Tree like hierarchies alleviate this problem to a certain level except when the cyclicality becomes a dominant mode in the interface. What I find cool with your start is that you have a ground where you can have the compiler generate the dependency graph and make it a first class entity to understand the (cyclomatic) complexity of your codebase.</p>

Most often that term is used for algorithms and data structures expressed in a programming language. However, many scientific ideas are not of that kind. The most powerful scientific models we have are expressed as specifications, not algorithms, and programming languages are not a good medium to express them.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh">Shalabh Chaturvedi</a> just shared a paper by Terry Winograd on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1331410504204488706"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1331410504204488706">https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1331410504204488706</a>) that addresses this point very well (and is 40 years old!). It describes "Three domains of descriptions" of software systems. Scientific concepts, models, and ideas belong to the "subject domain", whereas code is designed for the "domain of implementation".</p>
<p>However, if you define "code" in a wider sense that includes formal languages designed for other purposes than "programming", then I agree with everything you say üòâ</p>

<p>Support for a new program is actually pretty simple; but it gets more complicated on open source softwares like Blender that are under the GPLv3 license. In such cases, you're lucky if the software gives you access to the python module ctypes, which we use to access the pointers of internal Blender objects, and communicate with DLLs without ever writing a big chunk of code in Blender itself üòÅ</p>

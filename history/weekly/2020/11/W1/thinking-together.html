<p>It’s been a busy first three weeks and I’ve already learned a lot, which I hope to share eventually. I’m even more convinced now that Alexander has figured out a deep truth about designing and building beautiful things that absolutely needs to be adapted to the software world.</p>
<p>I’d love to invite those here who are interested in Alexander’s work to connect so we can attempt to bridge the two communities — in which way exactly I’m still contemplating and open to suggestions. At least I wanted to start a thread here which could become anything from an AMA about the course to a beacon for those who’d be interested in activities that might happen around this topic spanning both communities (I could picture an online event bringing us all together). If you want to be part of that, leave a comment in the thread and feel free to suggest ideas or ask me anything…</p>

<p>I only explicitly came across Alexander’s work relatively recently, through this community, but immediately resonated with much of the process he described of what it is to build something, and why we might do it. In my own work, I’ve naturally found myself drawn to an ‘unfolding’ approach, guided more by a sense of ‘wholeness’ than of any particular specifications. This has been in the context of working for a charitable community aiming to create ‘social spaces for social change’, with my role being to guide the creation of online spaces to complement physical spaces and activities.</p>
<p>I’ve just now enjoyed watching the introductory video from the publicly available webinar (<a href="https://www.buildingbeauty.org/nature-of-order-lecture-series"></a><a href="https://www.buildingbeauty.org/nature-of-order-lecture-series">https://www.buildingbeauty.org/nature-of-order-lecture-series</a>) and was happy to see how much of the conversation centred on the interaction of ‘wholeness’ in what we build and ‘wholeness’ in ourselves and our social relations, given that this seems to me the deepest meaning his theory has, which can then be applied to specific fields such as architecture or software.</p>
<p>In my own work, trying to enable people to have as much agency in the creation of online spaces as they would with physical spaces, this led me on a long journey, culminating over the past couple of years in (rather accidentally) creating a programming language (<a href="https://maraca-lang.org/"></a><a href="https://maraca-lang.org/">https://maraca-lang.org/</a>). Having now spent some time with this language, I would loosely describe it as a language for defining living/dynamic structure (the motivating example being a dynamic web page/app), in a way that feels at some level a little like sculpting clay, or other similar ‘unfolding’ acts of creation.</p>
<p>Similar it seems to Alexander and architecture, I haven’t found it easy to align with the general world of IT/tech, meaning much of this has been rather solo work, and can be challenging to articulate, so I’m looking forward to discussing these themes with others 🙂</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Your last paragraph really resonated with me as being what software really is / can be, as a medium.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Design Patterns in software are actually a horrific failure of an attempt to capture what Pattern Languages in architecture were fundamentally about. I'll explain:</li></ol><p>Design Patterns (if software was a building) are more like solving very particular (and invented) problems with the electrical wiring or plumbing, or building a wall with a limited supply of wood beams, etc. Nevermind why the building is being created in the first place (e.g. as a place to live, and therefore as a good place to live).</p>
<p>Pattern Languages are about shaping (and solving problems for) the human space within it. For example, an <a href="http://naturalhomes.org/pattern-112.htm"></a><a href="http://naturalhomes.org/pattern-112.htm">http://naturalhomes.org/pattern-112.htm</a> transition because "the experience you get leaving and entering your home influences the way you feel inside it". Nevermind how it's otherwise literally constructed.</p>

If the human model is only reflected on the outside, then it's just an <a href="https://youtu.be/NAjz0INs3Lc?t=12m14s"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/NAjz0INs3Lc?t=12m14s">https://youtu.be/NAjz0INs3Lc?t=12m14s</a> -- and not just in some idealistic sense: the software will behave in ways that are inconsistent with what it presents itself as, because it is NOT what it presents itself as. Try dragging or copy-pasting various things around in many document editors, and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>Conversely, software that does match (or is shaped by) the human model, can be broken down into (and understood in terms of) the same pieces that the human model can be broken down into and understood in terms of. (Every function, variable, expression, etc. forms either a direct part of that model, or a basis upon which to construct it). Think about it: The behavior of software is what happens when you use it and the code that makes it do that!</p>
<p>You see a similar contrast if you compare Bob Martin's "Screaming Architecture" to "Execution in the kingdom of nouns"</p>

With silly resources, I would try to adopt designs that perform extensive speculative execution.  For example, the web browser fetches and renders all the links so that when I finally click on one, it's already ready.  Sandbox becomes more important so as to model destructive possibile futures.  Assuming this fantasy setup doesn't have a magically fast clock, we only get a benefit from parallel execution.  The programmers are never going to have time to write stuff to run well in parallel, so instead of twiddling its thumbs, I'd have the system proactively test rewrites.  Amounts to a machine that perpetually asks itself, "why am I so slow?"</p>

The links between object references would be literal (conceptually, if not actually). Garbage collection would automatic, as each "object" cell would constantly propagate an "alive" signal (bit) to whatever it references. The moment an object is not connected to another "alive" object, it frees itself to be reallocated.</p>
<p>There is no way to reference an object by "address"; only by following a link from an object you already have a reference to.</p>
<p>In theory, if the instruction set was very small (e.g. all the operations for manipulating these objects and primitive values), then each "memory cell" would have it's own little processor, and correspond to one object (conceptually, if not actually). With this model, a computer can be more like fabric, and objects and processes can just "walk" it, like entities in the game of life. They could transfer from one environment to another so long add there was a connection, just like you'd transfer around objects in the physical world.</p>

Either it is not a problem to have any amount of resources (RAM, disk, number of cores but other kinds too, more about it below) and the environment and societal impact is low.</p>
<p>On the resource side, first I would add other kind of resources. Mainly interface resources. I.e. the computer has advanced HCI system. Not only mouse and keyboard but as much cameras and sensors needed to have better interactivity and help make it more tangible. As, for example, one where it is fast and easy to capture hand gestures.</p>
<p>Then, I would consider that people that have to collaborate with the language/environment, and that are not in front of the same computer, all have powerful computers that are all efficiently connected.</p>
<p>So I will answer on that basis!</p>

So the entire multiuser history is stored. Of course the programming/editing history, but also the executing history. Or some part of it, leaving aside what is still too resource intensive (like complex video playing/processing maybe) and less "useful". In fact, in that kind of system the boundary between programming/editing and executing is blurred.</p>
<p>In that environment, there is a focus on making things as tangible as possible. I.e. your programming artifacts are alive, you can see them and manipulate them interactively.</p>
<p>Some might not be possible to be really alive and tangible, but in that case everything is done to simulate them as realistically as possible. For example, if you are designing a complex infrastructure architecture, it is not always possible to make it tangible, in that case there is some simulation of it, so, as much as possible, things can be "tangibly" designed before making them concrete.</p>
<p>So I guess, part of the environment, there must be a serious and flexible "simulator" facility. With the system being aware between what is really tangible/moldable and what is just simulated and needs to be brought to life at some other time.</p>

<p>I really appreciate you pointing me towards Martin Kleppman! I’ve been looking into his work, and I’m on the Automerge slack channel and I may get involved in their Rust port implementation.</p>

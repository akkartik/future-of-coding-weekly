A note on the video: I think it is better presented by showing the problem first and then may be alluding to the kind of solutions that exist in the market and show how Instadeq solves it better, because otherwise, people who don‚Äôt have the context will find it a bit random. May be call it recipes or something and show how easy it is to solve the particular problem using Instadeq. In any case, great job polishing this and keeping on improving it.</p>

<p>The goal is enabling apps and users to manage information directly on an open and identity-centric network, without silos or trusted servers, and in the background of whatever tech stack/data models you're using today. Doing so makes critical info user-controllable, interoperable across any context, and much easier to build with and collaborate on. It's pretty early and works best with key-based auth right now, but working with partners to make it easy to use with social logins/magic links soon. Would love any and all feedback if this fits the goals of projects you are working on!</p>

This made me really think that the abstraction level at which we usually think about ‚Äúnode-and-wire‚Äù programming (typically the AST level) might not be optimal for exploring codebases. Just sort of spewing my thoughts here, but perhaps it would be better to expose different representations at different ‚Äúzoom levels‚Äù: for instance, if I zoomed into a file inside the code browser, it would turn into a graphical editor, but if I zoom out, I get a text representation. Or maybe it would be more reasonable to give the user a choice of which representation they wanted to see at a particular level of abstraction. It just seems like there is no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù representation that can encompass all levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>It also made me think deeper about the notion of ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù, and how we might do well to embrace some of those ideas as a community: don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are some things that you can only do by taking a ‚Äúgreenfield‚Äù approach to development, but I think there is so much room for improving the status quo, that even ‚Äúsmall‚Äù changes in representation with existing languages/tools (in this case, JavaScript and the Monaco editor from VS Code) could have on the ‚Äúnear-term future of coding‚Äù.</p>
<p>I think it would be really neat to explore breaking out the ‚Äúshow references‚Äù functionality into separate editor windows (or ‚Äúblocks‚Äù) as well, something along the lines of what Dark has done in their editor  (image below).</p>
<p>Maybe the ‚Äúfind references‚Äù command could draw temporary arrows to the files in the file explorer window, or highlight open windows that contain references to the item in question.</p>
<p>Finally, I think this would be absolutely killer for doing collaborative code reviews/pair programming. Stellar work!</p>

<p>That‚Äôs really good to know re mixed feedback. My current goal is to explore the best code reading experience (ala github).

I love the idea of different lenses (e.g. zoom levels) on the same underlying. One thing I definitely want to explore is presenting the outline view somehow (high-level AST - e.g. functions, classes, etc.).</p>
<p>I think your point of ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù is really important. When I hear ‚Äúfuture of code‚Äù (or prompts like ‚Äúwhat does coding look like in 10 years‚Äù), my mind jumps immediately to inventing PL and completely new tools. But you don‚Äôt need to convince me that if I tried to built an editor, even I wouldn‚Äôt end up using it. Actually another one of my projects was building something Dark-like (something I admire a lot) but with JS and monaco-editor panes on a canvas, very similar to the demo I linked to. Dark has so many good ideas and I love the exploration but I think it‚Äôs going to be hard to get people to learn a new language/editor today. Honestly, the most ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù thing I could do is probably build a VSCode extension but I want the space to explore for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the ideas and kind words! Imagine a Github browser and pull request UI that looks more like a canvas. That‚Äôs the direction I‚Äôm stumbling towards.</p>

<p>one thing I‚Äôd think about is getting a little more task-focused (this is already a pretty task-focused interface)</p>
<p>I find myself creating a kind of mise-en-place in iTerm windows where I‚Äôm setting stuff up for some larger change or understanding. I think theres some implicit structure here that you‚Äôre hinting at with the child-pane relationships, and the notes that are free-floating vs the notes that are implicitly linked to certain views (e.g. ‚Äúthis is the code when <code>useMemo</code>‚Ä¶). I think the structure isn‚Äôt so much the code as it is code-and-task. I‚Äôd guess/hypothesize that the hierarchy actually goes big note (‚Äúlet‚Äôs look at the hook <code>useMemo</code>‚Äù), annotation-style notes (on mount, it calls the given..)  -&gt;  code symbols. theres a graphy-outlinely thing here (although I prefer these panes to say a workflowy interface, since in my experience stuff looks like a graph when youre working on it and an outline when you‚Äôre done)</p>
<p>maybe it‚Äôs actually that your notes are suggesting a transclusion‚Äî let‚Äôs look at the hook useMemo could be a notion-style slashword interface for pulling up code fragments that come immediately after where you typed in a separate pane</p>
<p>I really like the interface in macOS where you can box-select a bunch of files on the desktop and right click to collect them all into a folder. this feels like it could use that kind of a grouping construct</p>

<p>Some time ago I played with CRDT using Rust and WebAssembly! It was more a project to play with the CRDT concepts, and an occasion to try Rust and its compilation to WebAssembly. It was a very basic POC for a offline first text editor. It was for a local conference. Here is a link to code: <a href="https://gitlab.com/ogadaki/sunnytech-2019-wuer"></a><a href="https://gitlab.com/ogadaki/sunnytech-2019-wuer">https://gitlab.com/ogadaki/sunnytech-2019-wuer</a></p>

A visual/notebook based purely functional programming development environment with live data and time traveling for both previous inputs and each step of a run that uses CRDTs for collaboration.</p>
<p>Seeing it on this thread has me worried that this may be pushing the limits too much for what‚Äôs currently feasible?
I‚Äôm using Rust targeting wasm in browser. Is this possible now? Do I need this beast machine to make that happen?</p>

<p>Your demo looks super cool! I think it‚Äôs a great visual representation of what the CRDT is doing. I‚Äôm still very much a novice in the CRDT space, once I get more up to speed I look forward to digging into the code to help me learn üë®‚Äçüíª</p>
<p>I also have Kleppmann‚Äôs Designing Data-Intensive Applications sitting on my shelf waiting to be read.</p>
<p>As for my project, TableFlow, I built a basic dummy demo of it in React if you want to check it out: <a href="http://tableflow.org/studio/flow/#a"></a><a href="http://tableflow.org/studio/flow/#a">http://tableflow.org/studio/flow/#a</a></p>
<p>The motivation behind it is to build a ‚Äúbetter Excel‚Äù for power users and also software developers who would rather not deal with all the incidental complexity of modern app development for a project with complex logic, ie not just some CRUD app.</p>
<p>There are four core concepts: Tables, Flows, Subflows, and Decisions:</p>
<ul><li>Tables are the core data type. Depending on how they are configured they can be algebraic data types (ADTs/enums), structs/maps, lists, values, and/or an arbitrary nesting of any of these. Sort of like a statically typed version of JS objects with ADTs and a shorthand for tabular data built in.</li><li>Flows are pure functions. A Flow can be called by any other Flow or via a REST (or possibly gRPC) call to an endpoint from outside of TableFlow. A Flow can contain zero to any number of Subflows.</li><li>Subflows are functions just like Flows, but they can only be called once and by their parent. They‚Äôre sort of the opposite of a closure in that scope must be explicitly passed into them. They are very similar to Brian Will‚Äôs concept of a ‚Äúuse‚Äù function. They help break up Flows both visually and in terms of size/scope. At any point in the future a Subflow can be converted into a standalone Flow if necessary.</li><li>Decisions are DMN decision tables on steroids. They are where conditional logic, Flow branching, and auto-iteration over all the rows in a table happen. Good example of the first two: <a href="https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/20.3/Appian_Decisions.html"></a><a href="https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/20.3/Appian_Decisions.html">https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/20.3/Appian_Decisions.html</a></li></ul><p>There would be live data supplied to a Flow by filling in the input Tables. There would be a slider at the top of this input to time travel through the input history. Some of these inputs can be saved as ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù along with their corresponding outputs. TDD would be built in, so every time a change is made, all applicable snapshots are run against the change and its outputs.</p>
<p>Once a run occurs, there would be a built in time traveling debugger. Each piece of computed/output data would have its own slider that jumps between when there was actually a change to that piece of data in the last run. Recursion is possible so there may be multiple time points.</p>
<p>I also want Tables to be reusable between Flows. The software engineer in me really wants to add public and private ‚ÄúTable Subflows‚Äù (ie methods) and then I‚Äôm like, well why not interfaces too!</p>
<p>I will probably settle for reusable Tables with methods. Having interfaces would be great, but then I remind myself that even power users of Excel aren‚Äôt use to being able to write their own functions natively!</p>
<p>The eventual goal would be to build a TableFlow config =&gt; Rust compiler that would spit out a production grade Rust server.</p>
<p>Can you see me drowning in my own ambition yet?  üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶à</p>
<p>I played around with doing the UI in Elm, looked at ReasonML, and I‚Äôm currently giving Seed (seed-rs) a spin. I like The Elm Architecture for the frontend, but I‚Äôm just going to try doubling down on the Rust-&gt;wasm ecosystem and hopefully the wasm DOM API becomes a thing down the road and closes the performance gap.</p>

I guess this can become very tricky. I guess you have to find a way to manage the space limit for the history, i.e. when it takes too much resources. For simple use case it can be fine, but when you manage big tables that changes often you will have to remove part of the history.</p>

<p>And trying to create tools for them and also for some ‚Äúexpert‚Äù developers is something very interesting.This honestly comes from me being a big personal finance nerd, and I once made a spreadsheet that calculates all of my finances, think a personal double sided balance sheet. Coming back a year later though, it made the engineer side want to cry. It was impossible to maintain efficiently, but I also didn‚Äôt want to manage an app to do it either. Then as I learned more about the adoption of Functions-as-a-Service, it seemed to really extend the upper limit for the use cases.</p>
<p>I guess you have to find a way to manage the space limit for the history, i.e. when it takes too much resources.Yeah, this is definitely an outstanding question. I imagine I will just do a simple set sized FIFO cache to start out, and then down the road I could push to something like IndexedDB (once those bindings actually exist in Rust -&gt; wasm).</p>

Maybe you could find a way to "initialize" the output variable at/near the end, or maybe just take that perspective as a vote for explicit returns.</p>
<p>What are the intended semantics of example 4, where you seem to have x and out mapped to the same register in the same scope. Or is out spilled during the body block, and the assignment to out is targeted at the stack, then popped between the body block and the "actual" function block? It looks like I answered my question while writing it, but I'll leave this just in case I got it wrong...</p>

I wish I'd thought of that a year ago..</p>
<p>If you first ignore outputs, the semantics of a <code>var</code> B in a new block are that it shadows any var A in an outer block. However, a second <code>var</code> C to the same register in the same block simply clobbers the register. There's no way afterwards to get the first var B.</p>
<p>Now reintroducing function outputs in example 4, the assignment to <code>out</code> would write register <code>eax</code>. Then the <code>break</code> would increment the stack pointer to skip the saved value of <code>x</code> before jumping to end of function.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>

So at the write to <code>out</code>,  <code>x2</code> is "shadowing" <code>x</code> in <code>eax</code>, <code>x</code> is on the stack, then <code>out</code> clobbers <code>x2</code>?</p>
<p>My instincts say,  if you're doing it this way, <code>out</code> should be spilled to the stack like other vars when you enter <code>$foo:body</code>. Then the break would in principle pop <code>x</code>, immediately pop <code>out</code>, and <code>ret</code>. If you're treating output vars as a special case wrt storage management, I don't see how you're getting any benefit from making them syntactically look like regular vars.</p>
<p>Is anything sensible supposed to happen if you don't immediately follow a write to an output with a break or something? Is that verboten, and if so is it checked?</p>
<p>Maybe you should just ban mapping multiple vars to to same register in the same block, and consider <code>out</code> mapped at the function level. <code>x</code> isn't allowed to be in <code>eax</code> until you push a new block.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is semi-useful, but it's late here. :) FWIW, I didn't invent the idea about returns being the start of a new lifetime. It's mostly derived from Single Static Information IR, which has a similar relationship to SSA as Plan9 does to Unix: even more idealistic, and no one uses it.</p>

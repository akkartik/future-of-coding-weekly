<ul><li>Investors are successful game developers with millions of dollars (usually)</li><li>They espouse a model that worked well for them (independent development, usually no publisher, direct upload to Steam / Xbox / online stores), so there’s also a social / philosophical angle here w.r.t. the approach they want to popularize</li><li>They also provide timely advice on non-game things like how to market your game, thinking about game conferences, thinking about launches, tc.</li><li>It was launched during a period when these people felt Microsoft / Sony were being mean allegedly to indie developers and giving them bad deals. They wanted to offer an alternative to that</li></ul><p>So I think in every way, IndieFund is able to offer unique funding and unique perspective.</p>
<p>The questions I’d have for a FoC fund are:</p>
<ul><li>What can the community uniquely offer an FoC project? Can we be the ‘best’ option for this?</li><li>What does a FoC style project actually need? Grants? Reliable funding commitments?

That’s my guess / perspective anyway. Patreon / OpenCollective may still be better for the large # of small donations approach to funding. Not sure!</p>

<ul><li>This funding model would fit people on the "industry" side of FoC, who are working on a prototype with the plan to turn it into a usable tool, perhaps even a product. But it doesn't feel like it would fit people on the "academic / research" side of our community, who often need to spend a few years just to prove that a particular path isn't viable. (Eg: Would $XXX for a month or two meaningfully help <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathoda/">Jonathan Edwards</a> succeed in ways he otherwise wouldn't?). So in addition to the "only for people who can't otherwise raise money", this cuts down group of potential beneficiaries to an even smaller number.</li><li>Indie fund also takes a small cut of sales for the games they fund, which is how they make it sustainable.</li><li>I am in general very fond of the idea of "everyone pitches in a little so that someone who needs a lot can have it right when they need it".</li><li>I think there's a minimum threshold where the amount of money goes from "token gesture" to "actually helpful", and I think that that threshold is probably higher than what this community would be able to raise if all the regulars here chipped in $X (single digit).</li><li>The Clojure community put together something like this — <a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org"></a><a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org">https://www.clojuriststogether.org</a>. They funded it with a few large backers rather than many small backers. It's been running for a few years now and seems good. I think the Ruby community also does this, probably other communities too. So it's not outside the realm of possibility.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-11-02T15:59:24.330Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Mariano Guerra</span> <a href="#2020-11-02T15:59:24.330Z" class="date">2020-11-02 15:59:24</a> <div class="message"><p>maybe a format closer to "google summer of code"?</p>

<p>I had been planning to set up a pateron for the community itself (to fund some community-focussed projects), but then the pandemic hit, and the BLM protests happened, and now there's the election. Hasn't felt like an appropriate time to ask folks for money for the community. But maybe I'm just being nervous, and dreading responsibility. :$</p>

<p>This is the way to fund something substantial. I wonder if we have access to those few large backers here within the community, or if this (still) requires outreach to elsewhere?</p>

So unless there are some folks here who are willing to kick a few $k into a pot each month to help the community and/or specific members' projects, I think we'd need to reach outside.</p>
<p>(Steve talked some big game about this just over a year ago now, proposing a $20m fund for FoC. A lot of folks got excited about that, because funding is scarce, but the $20m was never a real thing, just a hypothetical sure would be nice if someone paid us for this, hey? My armchair analysis of that whole.. thing.. is that Steve was just trying to feel out what it'd take for him to maintain an interest community management.)</p>

We haven't had anyone ask for patronage yet (other than Steve Krouse, back in the day), but if someone wanted to do that, I'd be okay with it as long as it wasn't spammy. (Eg: if someone only ever posts about their patreon, that's no good. But if someone wants to launch a patreon here, or occasionally ask for support as part of some other milestone announcement or some such, that's fine by me. We'll fine-tune the social norms around that was we go, once we learn what feels good.)</p>

What seems to work in other creative disciplines is a competitive market or scene. There is a place to release your work, repeatedly face rejection and criticism, and occasionally win. The key seems to be a communal value system. People strive to produce valued work, but often with an edge that tries to nudge the values in some direction. People care enough about the values that they invest in evaluating and criticizing other people’s work.</p>
<p>If you want to fund the future of computing I suggest funding a competition with a prize.</p>

<p>The main issue would be that once someone is receiving the funding, say they quit their job, now there is massive friction against the funding moving to another, potentially better idea.</p>

Side projects both assume a lot of free time and being willing and able to use that free time to work on the side project.

<p>They talk about borrowing ideas from the indie games world, self-funding via Patreon, collecting donations for the "public goods" part of research (papers, ideas, etc) while still working on proprietary commercial software, how PARC was funded relative to the rest of the industry at the time, how the industry has changed since and what that means for funding research, etc.</p>

More questions than answers.</p>
<p>Every large software project can benefit from having a pattern language to direct and coordinate the development. "Large" means: multiple contributors, with the need for coordination between contributors, or, a single person project with enough code, written over a long enough period of time, that you can't keep all the details in your head.</p>
<p>My Curv project has a pattern language, but much of it is implicit knowledge. It will be beneficial to make that knowledge explicit, to write it down. It will speed up development by making it easier for me to make design decisionsand engineer past roadblocks. And it will make it easier for other people to contribute to the project.</p>
<p>Curv, as a programming language, has an ASCII text syntax. Part of the pattern language will deal with centres, activities and patterns relating to that syntax. What gives "life" to a language syntax?</p>
<p>Curv is also a development environment. The project's pattern language will deal with the developer's experience of using Curv and its associated associated development environment to create, run and debug software. What are the related centres, activities and patterns?</p>
<p>And there is a meta level. Curv is used for software development. Part of large scale software development is creating a pattern language for your project. How does Curv help developers create and use a pattern language? What are the patterns for that?</p>
<p>In formal language theory, a language is a vocabulary and a set of grammar rules which recursively unfold to generate all the valid sentences or utterances in that language. We use these same ideas of generative grammar to design and think about programming languages. Alexander's method seems to be inspired by generative grammar, because he talks about recursively unfolding patterns to generate architecture.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the links between Alexander's method and programming languages? Can do you design a programming language's vocabulary and grammar rules so that they recursively unfold to generate living structure?</p>

The other thing that Alexander adds is sequence. It is not just that there is a grammar that unfolds, it is also about what non-terminal unfolds when. If you arrange the unfolding steps in the right way, you only talk about as much detail as you need right at that step in the process, but not more. </p>
<p>This is what we currently fail at in programming, because nothing ever works if you don’t implement it on the lowest level. And so we constantly get drawn into the lowest levels full of detail, even when we’re still trying to figure something out at the very top of the grammar talking about highly abstract concepts.</p>

It seems to me like the difference between using Photoshop and using a whiteboard to have a high-level design conversation: the ephemeral nature of a whiteboard conversation allow for rapid iteration and communication, but it’s not like I would ever want to take that whiteboard drawing and paste it into Photoshop to try and tweak it. Similarly, I wouldn’t want to stand around Photoshop talking about design ideas because the tool is simply too “heavy” for the task. <a href="https://twitter.com/galtenberg">Christopher Galtenberg</a> “comment-oriented programming” is something I do frequently, I keep going back to this thread from a few months ago: <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1586957244445200"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1586957244445200">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1586957244445200</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/girba">Tudor Girba</a> I think that’s a nice way to characterize it: perhaps the term “pseudocode” is a bit loaded in this context…</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[April 15th, 2020 6:27 AM] joshchonpc: Are there any languages with explicit focus (and philosophy) around intermediary steps between ideas and working code? Modern programming languages feel like I must, in part, produce completed structures of code, rather than brainstorming and exploring. Programming inevitably alternates the code from working to not working to working to not working, etc, and we would benefit from languages that were more explicit about facilitating the ‘not working’ states. From my rough intuition, the ‘not working’ states of code outweigh ‘working’ state in terms of time and importance (e.g. compiler for code that is exploratory but does not work).</p>
<p>REPL, for a very simple idea, is praised so much (and so widely used) perhaps for this reason — it facilitates intermediate steps. This would be a rough parallel to how Bret Victor mentions that “ideas are important” to him. I looked at &lt;<a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/four-years-of-studying-exploratory-programming-4656586b1d3b|Exploratory">https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/four-years-of-studying-exploratory-programming-4656586b1d3b|Exploratory</a> Programming&gt;, but it doesn’t seem to capture exactly what I want (i.e. goes a bit too shallow).</p>

In some sense you’re painting in broad strokes and then filling in the detail later. It’s possible to build a programming system that enables a similar flow. It just requires allowing for implication and ambiguity so you can layout the idea before fully realizing it. That’s a research-level problem, but our approach seems to be pretty promising so far. 🙂</p>

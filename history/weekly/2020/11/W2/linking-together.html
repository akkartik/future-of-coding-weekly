Excel embeds images as well. On a team I was on they used google sheets for bug tracking and pasted screenshots into cells. I'm not saying that was a good experience given there was no way to easily filter which bugs are fixed or who is looking into them plus loading a sheet with 500 screenshots is slow. But didn't see anything in the tool above that suggested it would do any better at these problems.</p>
<p>i'm not trying to put down custom tools, only from the video it looked like all they got from is particular one was an extremely tedious way of making basically a spreadsheet but minus 90% of the features, many of which are useful.</p>

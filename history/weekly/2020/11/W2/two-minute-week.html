<p>Slow progress on making the audio side of the project into something more robust and useful.</p>
<ul><li>Added audio configuration for choosing sound device (on the top right of the screenshot)</li><li>Added a spectrum analysis window.  If this looks familiar, it's the same FFT/GUI code I contributed to Sonic Pi, although here it is using ImGui</li><li>Continuing work on dock windows/gui setup.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"><blockquote><p>ðŸ“· <a href="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T5TCAFTA9-F01DWH2NW05/image.png">image.png</a></p>

Since many nodes in the graph might be processing music data at the current audio rate, I needed to shut the graph down, reconfigure the nodes, and restart.</p>
<p>This builds on previous work I've done to manage the graphs inside the audio pipeline.  Effectively a graph is either 'Active' or 'Inactive'; the distinction is that an active graph can be run inside the audio thread.  A graph is made inactive by quickly swapping pointers under a spin-lock.  This means that the audio thread never waits for a graph, and never does a mutex lock which can schedule away from the audio thread when the lock is freed.</p>
<p>Technical details aside, this is tricky to make clean and robust, but I think I'm there.</p>

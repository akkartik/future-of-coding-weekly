<p>Interesting, I'd love to hear more - currently I have a "got to source in a new split" set up in vim which sounds similar to what you're proposing (when exploring new codebases I usually have a lot of panes opened this way, ultrawide monitor really helps then) - feels like we could improve on this a lot if I wasn't limited by what vim can do.</p>

It provides the "column view" of exploring a code/system down a specific path.</p>
<p><strong>@Paul Shen</strong> some more feedback: I'm not sure drawing to code line is ideal. Just scrolling will cause the line to move and most lines will still be pinned to the top or bottom (out of view). However snapping the connection to the 'scroll bar location' which is more stable and visually provides the location of the sub-window in the parent window.</p>
<p>One issue I had browsing around was scrolling in the canvas vs scrolling within a window. Since it's the same shortcut, often I scroll in the window when I want to pan the canvas. Would be nice if I had to click to make it active first.</p>

<p>re: scrolling. I was thinking of adding a delay on editor hover before activating scroll and seeing how that felt. You can also spacebar+drag and middle-click drag to pan canvas to avoid scrolling.</p>

Part of the problem is that counterintuitively navigation has become much more heavy weight. Instead of only dealing with one dimension of movement, you now have two and while you could just scroll in the current window, you‚Äôre then messing up your nice flow graph layout. What we saw in our studies was that people ended up generating lots of little boxes that they then spent effort trying to keep track of and garden. This is one of those things that doesn‚Äôt come up in most demo-y contexts, because the flow of navigation tends to be very unidirectional in the examples we give. But moving between those editors is a full blown context switch, whereas scrolling around is cognitively lower burden. This is why LT tried out some other ideas (three stacks where only the middle one is controlled by you and a stack itself acted like a document, documents made of disconnected blocks, etc), but they also had interesting issues, namely that it turns out files provide a kind of hidden context that‚Äôs important for both understanding and navigation.</p>

<p>Second para: if we spill <code>out</code> to the stack, then the assignment to it is kinda misleading. It looks like we're writing to a register but we're really writing to the stack. The only reason to expose registers is that many instructions have constraints on how many writes to memory they can perform. Memory variables that look like registers defeat the purpose.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just use a calling convention where outputs go to the stack rather than registers. I'll keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Para 3: yes it's supposed to be checked. But it isn't currently. Having strong checks is the purpose of this issue.</p>
<p>Para 4: I may well have to do that. It would be dashed inconvenient, though, to not be able to assign an output from nested blocks.</p>

<p>"Tool for thought" and "augmentation of human intelligence" has a rather vase meaning, obviously. Programming environments <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/"></a><a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">https://gtoolkit.com/</a> be tools for thought, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad</a> design tools, writing tools and more [0]. But I worry that most people who are starting to get introduced to the term, only see a narrow manifestation of it in the form of Personal Knowledge Management systems. This could further obfuscate the wonderful but nebulous "tool for thought" idea, and make it even less accessible than it already is.</p>
<p>This feels similar to the semantic change of the term "Object Oriented Programming" that was initially about <a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"></a><a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html</a>, but since most people's introduction to it was through C++/Java, it lost its original meaning and became about objects, making the original idea behind OOP even more obscure.</p>

<p>Local-first is a great value to uphold. I‚Äôm also a believer in 1-user software and plain text. For all of those, files, folders, and even zip still feel like the way. Let Dropbox/iCloud/whatever take care of sync and share.</p>

It reminds of the move from websites at a domain to services like Facebook, Twitter, and Medium (captured well in this Oatmeal comic <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people"></a><a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people">https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people</a>).</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the solutions to this problem is. And, in fact, for most people, having everything owned and managed by a cloud provider is probably <em>a better arrangement</em> than having them manage their own backup system with local files.</p>
<p>I'm aware that the paper solves all these issues at once, but the real issue is that it's not valued by enough customers to get the software providers to implement it, and I don't know how to solve that.</p>

A local first editor can still persist data on a "robust centralized cloud". Well, writing this I realize that in fact that depends what one understand by "cloud-based"... Here, I only mean that local first allows to work even when a centralized repository is not available or is not trusted, but at some time it is still useful to have your data stored "non locally", and cloud hosting can then be desirable.</p>

I think Apple's iCloud model is pretty close to right, and we know how highly the company regards "great experience" (all caveats &amp; multiple lapses notwithstanding) -</p>
<p>iCloud aggressively seeks to ensure that data is pulled and pushed frequently enough that all devices' local versions of file data are available and ready - of course there are still so many failure scenarios that it's easy to spot when one device's app's doc is definitely not up-to-date</p>
<p>That all said, even a stellar solution within a closed ecosystem is no good to us - but I think iCloud highlights the attitude that "local files up-to-date and available before you need them" is the right one</p>

Though continuations have a certain theoretical elegance, they generally mismatch use-cases so that you always end up wrapping them.  Common Lisp conditions have always seemed better to me than exception mechanisms.  Most exception (maybe just my exceptions) are bugs, and then you want to keep the stack, be able to drop into a REPL, figure out what's going on.  The fact that exceptions often have a print_stack_trace method just goes to show that you actually want to keep the stack.</p>
<p>The other main use of exceptions is for a quick escape from nested computation.  After years, I think I've come over to the checked exception camp on those.  In other words, if a checked exception doesn't feel good in a situation, an unchecked one isn't either, and you should be using a sort of condition system.</p>
<p>AND then if the condition is the kind of thing where you may, for instance, want to get feedback to from the user, then you're likely going to want coroutines of some sort.  I mean you were doing something step-by-step, but now it's broken, so set that aside, look for a fix, then come back to it.</p>

This is for the shaders/graphics the user creates.  GL because it is a guaranteed lowest common denominator.  DX12/Vulkan because they are the cutting edge.  I don't want to use Metal if I can help it.</p>
<p>For GUI elements I have 2 approaches:</p>
<ul><li>ImGui.  This sits on top of the API's I just mentioned and does buttons/checkboxes/windows, etc.</li><li>NanoVg.  This is a vector drawing library along a similar vain to ImGui.  It has slightly better support for pattern rendering, and is a bit simpler to use for basic primitives.  It also uses GL, etc. for the bottom level of drawing.In this image, ImGui is drawing the left hand text editor, the sequencer along the bottom.  NanoVg is drawing the Nodegraph UI inside the top right window.  And everything sits on top of OpenGL in this example.</li></ul><p>My choices are based on ease of use and cross platform.  Using custom GUI code for each platform is out of the question.</p>
<p>I have a version of the text editor in the image that runs on Qt.  Qt is a good cross platform choice for 2D/UI frameworks, but it is my least favourite API to work with (I do it for a day job too, so I am proficient at using it).  Qt is powerful, but can be very frustrating.  On the other hand, using it as a way to get a QPainter and draw shapes would be an easy cross platform method.</p>
<p>I use SDL to do the heavy lifting of creating OS specific windows for drawing in.  SDL is a great way to get a window on screen.  ImGui integrates will with it.  So my pathway is SDL-&gt;OpenGL/DX-&gt;ImGui OR NanoVg</p>

<p>I'm unhappy how state is managed in every OOP framework and every framework that uses a VDOM. I think neither mutability with objects nor mutability on another layer (vdom) works well.</p>
<p>Building something else has been hard for me. Text rendering especially.</p>
<p>Building something cross platform makes it 100x harder.</p>
<p>Using the web platform doesn't work, when you try to build on a lower level: You can't even measure text dimensions easily.</p>
<p>I've tried building up my own cross-platform solution based on WebGL, WASM (Rust), but failed at font layout. Compiling harfbuzz to wasm just didn't work for me, despite some people claiming to have done that.</p>
<p>So, I'm considering non-web solutions again. Basically, I'm really interested what others have to say.</p>

I've used Direct2D on windows before; that is nice renderer.  Qt is very nice for fonts as long as you are happy to bite into that huge apple.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use an OS specific renderer to draw your specific text onto a texture and then apply it in the engine; that gives you the best of both worlds, but you need to write custom bits.</p>

It should support hybrid 2D/3D, and it should be extensible using procedurally defined graphics primitives (signed distance functions) as seen on <a href="http://shadertoy.com"></a><a href="http://shadertoy.com">http://shadertoy.com</a>. So there are  no limits to what a UI can look like. You aren't boxed in by the SVG 2D rendering model or by what HTML/CSS can render.</p>
<p>Shadertoy code has performance cliffs. To make this efficient, it should use an extended version of Raph Linus's GPU accelerated rendering architecture: <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2020/06/13/fast-2d-rendering.html"></a><a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2020/06/13/fast-2d-rendering.html">https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2020/06/13/fast-2d-rendering.html</a> Briefly, there is a display list of primitives loaded on the GPU, the viewport is partitioned into tiles, and each tile renders only primitives visible in that tile.</p>
<p>Cross platform means Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS and web via WASM and WebGPU.</p>
<p>Anybody want to help build this?</p>

<p>In general it's an attractive pattern to be able to build up an object gradually over separate steps. The way C++ or Java are designed, the easiest way to do this is using null. (It can also be done by using lots of separate interfaces, but this is more work).</p>
<p>The reason null is a billion dollar mistake is because it allows you to 1. null everything, 2. retrieve a null value.</p>
<p>If the null pointer exception was thrown at the moment you called x = obj-&gt;value (if value is null, not obj) it wouldn't be able to permeate so much.</p>
<p>JS actually does the concept of 'missing' correctly but then throws in null as a kind of turd in the punch bowl.</p>
<p>The other point has been addressed by modern languages such as Kotlin where properties must be explicitly marked as nullable (I would make it 'optional'), and then reference with ?&gt; instead of -&gt;</p>

I don't think you can avoid ending up with something morally equivalent to dynamic typing: you're going to branch on (or use as a lookup key, whatever) the current type somehow, even if you manage to stash the branch in the runtime. I more often think of this in terms of migrating between different serialization formats or database schemata. Maybe another (equivalent?) perspective is as a discriminated union type where you keep adding variants over time. (Have you ever noticed that an instance of a sum type looks a lot like a dependent pair, with the payload dependent on the value of the discriminant? Is that an artifact of my shaky understanding or does everyone know that already?)</p>

<p>I have more than a few things to say about this topic. My position is that the generic nullability is bad. Also, empty strings are bad. Yes. Think about this: we've had the concept of 'zero' for 1000s of years but only very recently added the concept of 'empty string' - why? Could it be mainly for modeling in computers? There is no zero-like symbol you can write in a paper form where text is expected. Yes you could write <code>N/A</code> but that conflates null and "". Sometimes you might be asked to write why it is <code>N/A</code>.</p>
<p>Consider that there are valid questions for which the meaningful answer is zero: "How many toilet paper rolls are there in the store?", "What is the temperature of the snow?" etc. There are no questions where the 'empty string' answer has a clear-cut meaning: "What is your spouse's name?", "What city do you live in?" etc. What does an answer of <code>""</code> mean? It could mean "I don't know" or "I dont want to tell you" or "There isn't one". Can these always be mapped to null or ""? I don't think so.</p>
<p>In type systems that have both, the empty string and null, you end up with the question of 'what does null mean' vs 'what does empty string mean'. Sometimes when you have two missing values in the world that you want to model - you end up mapping these to '' and null. But really this has nothing to do with a generic solution - it's often just a reality twisted to fit the types. If you want to model three missing values e.g. 'unknown', 'non-existent', 'secret/intentionally-blank' - how do you map these to "" and null? Maybe the best solution here is to model the value as an enum? <code>unknown, non_existent, intentionally_blank, value(real_string_here)</code> . AFAIK no systems, languages have a great solution. However I feel better solutions lie in exploring the 'information modeling' space - RDF etc (perhaps with some kind of versioned schemas to describe what is possible and necessary.) Basically we don't want multiple data representations to correspond to a single reality (which is what happens in null vs "", or sometimes with nested <code>option&lt;option&lt;option&lt;t&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).</p>

If we take away implementation and ways to model them, strings are really just symbols in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order</a>. In that context, spaces don‚Äôt make much sense, neither do tabs, empty strings too. In my humble opinion we need to build a construct for orders and symbols (not just text, but any symbol you can imagine) and then modern string types can be considered special cases where we are talking about a total order of ‚Äòtext‚Äô symbols.</p>

Yes that could be one way to model strings. 'Text' however is a widespread concept outside computers and often mixed in with presentation as well (are paragraph boundaries important? Are underlines important?) So in some sense having a flexible 'container' of media provided by the user is reasonable too. Kinda like a 'bitmap drawing' or even 'rich text'. I don't think strings are particularly fundamental - they model some aspects of text (e.g. paragraphs) but not others (color, underline). In any case, the system won't look inside this media object to make decisions - it will just pass this object around and the meaning is entirely interpreted by another person at some other time. This is where I think "" and null become interesting: often we write <code>if text is none: ...</code> . So the system does look inside this shape.</p>

So I feel like this runs against the grain of what makes podcasts successful.</p>
<p>However, I agree that podcasts do lack these features. For example I really enjoyed the FoC episode on Orca but at some point I needed to stop and research what Orca was. And a lot of 99 Percent Invisible episodes come with an attached article with visual references.</p>
<p>Maybe there's an opportunity here to allow me to stop what I'm doing and have a quick glimpse at my phone to get a visual reference (eg. an Orca gif) so the podcast can continue uninterrupted.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that'd be useful ‚Äî not necessarily need to include full transcript, just mapping some images against specific audio periods is useful enough. Thinking about slides + audio, could be a great way to record lectures, esp visually intensive ones such as <a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/podcast-gediminas-urbonas/"></a><a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/podcast-gediminas-urbonas/">https://cmsw.mit.edu/podcast-gediminas-urbonas/</a></p>

<p>Hyperaudio seems interesting, will check it out. Although I don't like the website app approach. I'd want to have a open standard for a language, similar to WebVTT/SRT, for writing HTML (as opposed to text) against audio time.</p>

<p>Out platform is based on JavaScript and npm so it allows extensibility and bring-your-own-lib as you wish. Because of that and the nature of our own work (data viz with big or sensitive datasets) we decided to go for desktop app where you own your code and data. To enable git, graph layout is stored in json (ok not the best format) and each Node's code is in it's own CommonJS module. Additionally you can compile or export your app to one bundle.js+html+assets package for deployment to static hosting.</p>
<p>As we enter the public beta soon we are left with dilemma on making this sustainable. This is internal tool that pays the bills by supporting our project so in theory we could open source it but there is no resources for full support, PRs, community etc atm. So our current idea is to have free but proprietary IDE app with licensing limiting commercial use ("pay if you earn") and open source runtime allowing you to compile your project from command line to safeguard your projects even more.</p>
<p>I can see two ways forward:</p>
<ul><li><p>Nodes Pro where we have some advance or niche-specific features in the IDE (e.g. realtime collaboration, cloud hosting)</p>
</li><li><p>Content: where you try to leverage your know-how and provide value through paid nodes bundles (e.g. for architectural visualisation or ML) or courses and premium learning materials</p>
</li></ul><p>As mentioned in the original thread going free and open means anybody can do two above but there are benefits in community, opportunity gain for parent company, paid customisation gigs etc.</p>

Every time I go back and watch the canon of FoC videos, I more and more disagree with statements of the form:</p>
<p>If only everyone had followed this good old idea, everything would be great by now!</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul><li><p>Alan Kay in ‚ÄúThe Computer Revolution Hasn‚Äôt Happened Yet‚Äù says HTML and browser wars are stupid because we should be shipping the renderer with the file itself.</p>
</li><li><p>Bret Victor in ‚ÄúThe Future of Programming‚Äù says it‚Äôs crazy that we‚Äôre programming in text files because Smalltalk had a function-centered IDE.</p>
</li></ul><p>But I feel these examples always miss some important context. Social context, technical context, economic context. Shipping a rendering engine with an HTML file would be a technical nightmare. Programming still happens in text files because text files are an incredibly durable, universal format that can be passed around to dozens of auxiliary tools (e.g. code review -- see why everybody hates collaborating on Jupyter).</p>
<p>These talks are still obviously insightful, both for reminding us of computing history, and pointing out important issues in the status quo. But I‚Äôm always extremely skeptical when they don‚Äôt address why programming became the way it is. I have yet to see a talk that grapples with the messy reality of the world, how we have to daily work with huge systems coded by thousands of people who we barely trust. Gone are the days where 10 smart people at PARC can hack together an OS themselves with absolutely no concerns for security, accessibility, backwards-compatibility, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I would love to see more visions for FoC that take these realities into account.</p>

<p>I do agree that world is inevitably messy and that we have to deal with it. It is for this reason that I believe a new language to create systems, while well intended, is unlikely to address the problem of existing systems already out there.</p>
<p>At the same time, I do believe that we can make significant advances by focusing on the reverse part. The skill of reading the code we have is essential. And that cannot be improved significantly if the only form we have to read is text.</p>
<p>We should distinguish between a storage or exchange format for a content, and the interface through which we interact with the content. I can send an HTML file around, and still choose to view it in a browser. The two are distinct and still can coexist. The way we read doesn‚Äôt have to, and should not be the same as the way we edit.</p>

Well, mostly, in fact, I could discuss the part about text files, but I guess you only mean (or don't you? üôÇ ) it as an illustration, so I skip this discussion...</p>
<p>As for the context, I agree it is a very important aspect. It is which gives lots of inertia to what is happening and what we can change. And you have to be aware of that when you work on FoC projects. To use the cost function metaphor, we are at a local minimum. And all the social/technical/economic contexts explains why we are at this minimum. They are the force that pull us down to it.</p>
<p>So what is this local minimum? Is there other lower minima? Where are they? What is the path to go there? etc. And as Foc builders I agree with that we must know all this: the minima we want to reach and the path to go there. And you will do some compromises.</p>
<p>As an illustration, in my case, I identified that one context aspect of the current local minimum that is hard to go away for me, is the web plateforme. If I want to provide something that can be used by most of the people soon, I know the web plateforme is a very good fit. And even if it has lots of technical problems that I want to get rid of. So I decided to stick with this aspect of the current local minimum of "the present of coding" and choose to work on other aspects.</p>
<p>Here is another illustration of how to be aware and how to deal with these context aspects that are local minima. It is about adoption and audience. Something about the social context that is very costly to "move", is the current "programming audience". It is very hard to change habits and well established "standards", even if there are problems with them you want to change (random concrete example that I encountered: bash scripting). So one very risky and difficult strategy is to decide not to target this audience first and hope it will be convinced later. So I guess I will try this strategy, I want to propose new programming tools that I know most of today programmers won't want to use, so I will first target new programmers, that are not bias by the current programming context. Then if things go well, keeping the good parts of what I will build, maybe current "established" programmers will use them. So it is an other way to be aware of the context and try to deal with it to build a FoC vision.</p>

<p>It's important to consider the context. Why things are the way they are today. But also why things were the way they were yesterday.</p>
<p>Back then is was assumed that to use a computer one has to be a programmer. There was no distinction between programmer and user. It was the same. We've given that up, clearly. Even though many of us here seem to question if it has to be like that.</p>
<p>We are much further down a certain branch of the design space and it only ever gets more complicated from here. There's only so much we can "fix" here, if we stay on the same branch, take the present as given, and only look towards the future.</p>
<p>But what other places could we find, if we're willing to backtrack to a much earlier time and take a different branch from there?</p>

<p>I disagree which statements of this form too. I don't get this sense from most "FoC cannon" though. My interpretation is more like "hey this research trajectory looked really promising but never got funded, explored, developed, (in fact due to social and economic factors)". Possibly in the alternative reality we would have a new set of problems and issues. The FoC group (that's us in the alternative present!) would be discussing those problems and solutions in this slack really advanced multi media collaborative space . The question I ponder is: would we be looking at Unix + text files etc. (the "alternative that didn't happen") as something potentially better? I tend to answer "no".</p>

(Go with me here ‚Äî resist the urge to treat this as a multidimensional space.)</p>
<p>In the center, we have projects that resemble typical programming languages. These tools are designed with particular semantics that the programmer will employ to structure their problem solving. They are general purpose. They don't have much regard for the particular kinds of problems being solved. This is your Java, Clojure, Vulkan, brainfuck, etc.</p>
<p>Off to one side, you have programming tools that have both tightly defined semantics and a focus on solving particular kinds of problems. These are specialized. This is Excel, Notion, Max/MSP, OpenGL, bash, etc.</p>
<p>Off to the other side, we have programming tools that, while they still have semantics, don't expect you to work entirely within those semantics. They have even less regard for the problem domain. These are tools that expect you to first build some new tools from or within them, then solve your problem with those tools. This is Racket, and arguably REST, RDF, stored procedures in a DB, and other things.</p>
<p>Now my question: are you building an FoC project that falls into the latter category? If so, talk about that a bit. What's the rationale?</p>

<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone disagrees that we'll always have trade-offs, there's no getting away from them.</p>

(Eat your vegetables.) Sticking with text mode is an extreme form of this, hopefully I can break out of that in time."</p>
<p>I once wondered why text editors weren't better designed, given that they're the software that programmers make for themselves. But the more I've studied other software packages, the more I've come to believe that text editors actually are the best software that's ever been made. To make this argument, I'd put software like Emacs, Vim, BBEdit, TextMate, VS Code up against things like Photoshop, Excel, After Effects, Ableton Live. In my book, the text editors always come out ahead. They're more flexible, they're faster, they're more powerful, in that features can be combined in freeform ways more gracefully. The basic building blocks of selecting and operating on data works more fluently than in any other software I've encountered. Most of them can also be extended in powerful ways.</p>
<p>What do other people think? What software is better than text editors? (That's of comparable usefulness, I tend to want to narrow it to software that you actually make something with, e.g., because some utilities are so focused they practically vanish. But I'd still be curious what answers people have.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We will always have tradeoffs but the winners and losers are not always the same person. I might be in a situation where "nicer implementation properties" genuinely don't benefit me. </p>
<p>For example, I am basically insulated from the difficulties Intel engineers have in understanding their chip designs. If they have to take on enormous extra complexity to give me a minor performance improvement, then from the perspective of God it probably isn't worth it, but from the perspective of me, it is, because the cost in this trade to me is smaller than even a small benefit. In this sense a faster chip is always better, there's no tradeoff.</p>
<p>In nand2tetris, the language you design, Jack, requires each line to either start with <code>set</code> or <code>do</code>. So instead of saying <code>obj.func()</code> you have to say <code>do obj.func()</code>, instead of <code>a = 123</code> you say <code>set a = 123</code>. The design tradeoff they made here is to make the implementation of the parser/compiler easier at the expense of an annoyance when using the language. In the context of the nand2tetris course this makes sense because the user of the language and the implementer of the compiler are both you, but if Jack was a real language this would be absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, just because there will always be tradeoffs doesn't mean there aren't sometimes outright improvements. Leibniz's calculus notation is strictly better than Newton's, IMO.</p>

<p>The problem of Excel converting some gene names to dates (example: MARCH1) has been discussed for a while already. Biologists had adopted Excel believing it to be a general-purpose computational tool, but then discovered that Microsoft intended it to be a domain-specific tool for business data, without insisting much on that detail in their communication with the public. Several published genome studies already contained mistakes. So... what to do? The feature cannot be turned off, Microsoft didn't really care because biologists are not their main customer base, and re-training biologists around the world to use another tool wasn't doable. So they decided to change the names of the genes! This isn't an easy decision, and it will be costly as well, adding complexity to future bioinformatics software and confusion among biologists.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ChrisKnott">Chris Knott</a> Adapting to changes in the world around us is fine. Being shaped by tools as well - it's inevitable anyway. The issue here is (1) This is a partial bug fix, not an adaptation. Old and new gene names will coexist for many years and cause a lot of trouble. (2) Similar issues can happen any time again, if Microsoft decides to introduce more magic into Excel. It's OK to adapt to a changing world, but you want to have a say in how these changes happen when your core business is concerned.</p>

<p>I feel it‚Äôs like an 80/20 rule - this type of parsing satisfies 80% of the people so they made it default - I feel like when pasting/importing, there should be a intermediate mapping/what is this data step.

<p>Hofstadter mentions he has collected thousands of examples of errors like these (it's not clear if the "filing cabinet" he talks about is metaphorical or not).</p>
<p>I think it might also be useful to collect programming errors in a similar way (maybe put on the wiki eventually).

<p>Most programming errors are of the type "failed to understand the full consequences of my code" or "failed to consider all possible inputs". These are the types of errors that pros make. I am more interested in the type of errors that beginners make, that might reveal friction between how they might naturally express themselves or understand, and how they are forced to by the language.</p>

<p>The code used two helper functions which are specifically for a character walking on the x/z plane, rotating around the y-axis. The functions were NEWXVALUE() and NEWZVALUE() and were used like this;</p>
<pre><code>X# = NEWXVALUE(X#, A#, 1.5)

<p>I wanted to expand the example to include a second character controller by WASD. To do this I copypasted all the code, then went through and edited it.</p>
<p>The second character I made to have the variables XX# and ZZ#. I could get it set up ok, because I understood the initialization lines like</p>

<p>Such an error is impossible in Python or C, due to the syntax, but I wonder if the same underlying misunderstanding is there, or whether the syntax helps learners realise straight away my revelation.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve never had those kind of ‚Äúrevelations‚Äù on LSD about technology, but I‚Äôve never ‚Äúthought‚Äù about technology much on it, it hits me more in a spiritual/astral tripping way. Writing code with it is either a super-flow state or ADD-ish chaos, where I write out a bunch of dirty concepts all over the place to lay out the idea.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôve had similiar inspirations and breakthroughs on MDMA, which one might say is a ‚ÄúLSD for babies‚Äù in the way that it also boosts serotonin and processing bandwith of your brain. I find it isn‚Äôt as much as a ‚ÄúI know something I didn‚Äôt before‚Äù but more like seeing your mind compress the large network of complicated, related things into a simpler framework. Like when you build a ton of code and then just refactor it all into a smaller method. Quite interesting.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you create a new framework/language and accompanying tooling that saves time and money for dozens of developers all over the world.</p>
<p>How do you balance openness and monetisation?</p>
<p>Do you open source the framework/language but charge for the tools?</p>
<p>Do you keep it closed source?</p>
<p>Do you do self-hosted/SaaS and community/enterprise split like Gitlab for example?</p>
<p>If you open it, how do you earn money to let you work on it full-time? If it isn‚Äôt hugely popular immediately, you will have a hard time balancing earning money to live and working on it.</p>
<p>But if it‚Äôs closed, adoption will probably be low so customers/developers will be wary to use it.</p>

In my situation I currently get a subsidy for my project which comes in the form of "discount on taxes" which helps me to be able to spend more time on it but not full-time. In the (near) future I hope to find a customer who wants to use part of my project in such a way that I earn money by implementing there project with the help of my product. In this case you will need to make good agreements on which parts of the code are yours and can be reused/shared and which part of the code is theirs and will not be shared . But I am not sure this approach will work. A bigger problem for me is finding the right market focus, I can multiple ways. So I probably need to get that sorted out first</p>

The answer of the question comes case by case right? I'm thinking of examples like, say, Adobe Acrobat  vs the open PDF standard, or open source databases like MySQL vs consultancy on companies like Percona.

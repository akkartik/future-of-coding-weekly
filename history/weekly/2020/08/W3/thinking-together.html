For example, you might search for a "user", but then refine that search to a "banned user". Note that "banned" and "user" are not necessarily independent tags. Just because someone is a "banned user" and a "father" doesn't mean they're a "banned father" as well. The adjective "banned" could specifically relate to the noun "user".</p>
<p>Or a slightly clearer example: someone who is both a "skilled baker" and a "writer" is not necessarily a "skilled writer".</p>

<p>My first reaction is that every tag is a kind of adjective, i.e. they are descriptive, and it might be more that "banned" is a verb/gerundive that caused the distinction.</p>
<p>I think implicitly the #banned tag applies only to the "father tagged object" and not directly to the underlying object.</p>
<p>You could represent this with a kind of nesting;</p>
<pre><code>person #father#banned #blond

person #father #blond#banned

(person #father #blond)#banned

</code></pre><p>These could be used to represent, person banned for being a father, banned for being blond, and banned for being a blond father. The top one would match a query of <code>#banned</code>, <code>#father</code>, <code>#blond</code> and <code>#banned#father</code> but not <code>#banned#blond</code></p>
<p>o you could remember what filter the object is being considered under at the time the tag is applied.</p>

<p>What I meant to convey is:</p>
<p>In natural language, adjectives are sometimes ascribed to specific nouns, i.e. they are not transferrable between the different nouns that an entity can be named by. I added a second example to my original post that hopefully clarifies: someone who is both a "skilled baker" and a "writer" is not necessarily a "skilled writer".</p>
<p>I've not yet seen a tagging system that accounts for this linguistic phenomenon. That said, I'm still figuring out the extent to which supporting it could be useful.</p>

<p>person (#father) (#blonde) (#user) (#banned)</p>

This has long been the promise of semantic web technologies. However, they never broke the usability barrier. Tags are amazing because of their simplicity. As soon as you have skilled writers you have increasingly complex relationships where the computer is trying to model what is in the user's head.</p>
<p>It's doable, but complex and you run into all sorts of strange cases. Can you be a "skilled hobbyist" or a "skilled thinker"? As soon as you start applying meaning to the adjectives, you lose the ability for the definitions to adapt well based on the community using tags. The more precision you want, the more work you have to do. The more work you have to do, the less users want to do to maintain the taxonomy. IMO, this is one reason machine learning has been so successful. It can basically infer the relationships between tags based on how they are used. But you need a lot of data and you are at a decided disadvantage if you are searching using overloaded terms (I used to use a software package called "Chef" that had "cookbooks" and "recipes" - nightmare to find good docs for answers to questions).</p>

<ul><li>(folksonomy) My belief that a simple tagging system is inadequate is what led me to make this post. If <code>#skilled_baker</code> is an atomic tag, then you can't add qualifiers (extra adjectives) programmatically, unless you feel like playing with string parsing. I feel like qualifiers could be really important in a tag-based programming system: you can use it to organise/sort information within a specific context (noun), i.e. you don't pollute the global tag space and thereby risk the accidental inclusion of an entity into some faraway dataset that happened to use the same qualifier. You can use qualifiers to programmatically sort your <code>#user</code>s into <code>#free</code> <code>#user</code>s and <code>#premium</code> <code>#user</code>s.</li><li>(semantic) To me, this is the "graph view" of the problem. A graph-based model is an alternative to a tag-based model, in my mind (though some might argue you can combine them or switch between them). Some people are doing graphs, but I'm personally trying to avoid graphs where possible.</li><li>(statistical 1) This is about code (inference), not merely data! I think code is an important layer, but we can (and should) keep the layers separate. Code is not a tag, but code can apply tags. That still leaves us with the original question of what the tagging model should be.</li><li>(statistical 2) Ditto.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-08-11T01:27:31.379Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Nick Smith</span> <a href="#2020-08-11T01:27:31.379Z" class="date">2020-08-11 01:27:31</a> <div class="message"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stefanlesser">Stefan Lesser</a> In linguistics, I'm hoping to better understand the means by which we classify, qualify, and describe (etc.) things using natural language, and determine whether it is possible and useful to construct a simplified and reduced version of that as a means to classify, qualify, and describe digital information.</p>

If you follow linguistics -&gt; logics to tease out the meaning of the transmissions, you end up with First Order Logic-based knowledge representation systems, like -- as <a href="https://github.com/grokthis">Robert Butler</a> said -- the semantic web stack.</p>

It often sweeps away deeper understandings. Saying "tags are a graph" irks me, because a graph is defined as a set of nodes and edges (perhaps with attributes), and tags obviously aren't defined in terms of the same concepts. So perhaps the true relationship to be illuminated is: graphs can model anything that tags can model, i.e. graphs are a strictly more powerful model? This seems true when by "tag" we mean a traditional tagging system (hash tags), but that doesn't mean that all conceivable tagging/annotation systems are strictly less powerful than graphs. I'm worried that graphs are a conceptual cage that, once you've committed to thinking in terms of them, deny you the ability to discover new models.</p>

If it were, then we would already have found an ideal information model and/or programming language decades ago. Original ideas are needed. I spent a few years trying to do exactly as you suggest: take existing concepts/models/theories and just apply and combine them in the right way. But it's never worked out. Mathematicians invented predicate logic, and they invented graph theory. For my project I'm taking these ideas as inspiration but I truly think I need to invent a new model, which will obviously have some relationship/mapping to old ones.</p>

<p>I went down the linguistics route (I'm two years in now), and as much as I'm happy to find people interested in it, from the previous discussion I can only sense that it would be more of a distraction for you than it would actually help. What you seem to be looking for is what linguists and cognitive scientists call "categorization". When I found out about it, I was shocked how much linguists ask the same questions we ask when we try to design a good data model.</p>
<p>If you stay on the "classic" generative linguistics path (Chomsky et al.), you'd better get extremely comfortable around hierarchies and taxonomies. It seems most of the work here in the last few decades is basically trying to fit into the classic models what we learn about how the brain works, which more and more diverts from what can be meaningfully expressed with those models that are primarily based on set theory, perhaps with some fuzzy logic applied to it. It looks a lot like the frustration you voiced earlier ‚Äî we can make it work by stretching the current models and making them much more complex, but it's everything but satisfying.</p>
<p>There are linguists who realized that and who went looking for new approaches. I've been looking deeply into cognitive linguistics and think that's a great field to look at for inspiration. There's Rosch's prototype theory, which is still pretty close to classic categorization with a little bit of fuzzy logic sprinkled in, but that's just the gateway drug into metaphorical structuring and image schemas, and then all your set-theory based logic goes out the window, and you're left with embodied cognition and stuff that is way too ambiguous for what we'd like for static modeling. It seems you have extremely specific use cases in mind, and so I don't feel good about recommending you look into this.</p>
<p>When you say you're looking for more powerful models, "something more powerful than graphs", I wonder what that means to you?</p>
<p>If you want more flexibility in modeling, you need to take into account that this always comes in the form of trade-offs. Mathematics has this pretty much figured out though. If you look at algebraic structures you can pick one with few rules, which gives you a lot of flexibility of what you can model with them, but then you can't do much with these models ‚Äî if you can't make any assumptions about structure, you can't run algorithms against it. And you will see that graphs are already pretty high up there in terms of flexibility, but to do anything useful with them, you'd have to look at slightly more restrictive (semi-)lattices or‚Ä¶ tada‚Ä¶ trees again. There's a reason why almost anything can be represented as a graph. Look at Category Theory as an extreme (not to be confused with the "categories" from above). I guess that's the only branch left that qualifies as "more powerful than graphs", but then all its useful applications are only useful once you pull them back down into the land of graphs, sets, and trees.</p>
<p>I'm currently working under the assumption that "a better model" doesn't exist, or at least that I'm certainly not clever enough to invent it, and that the models we have are more than what's needed for progress ‚Äî the problem is just that we need different models at different times. That's why I'm betting on homomorphic representations and (bi-directional) transformations between them to solve some of the problems of static models that lack the flexibility we need to model dynamic systems.</p>

I've been spending a few years (first casually, but now seriously) mapping out what the "ideal programming system" might look like, and some aspects (like a model for code/change/time/distribution) are starting to become clear, but fundamental aspects like the structure of information are still unclear. I've been saying for a long while that I will write a blog post when a sufficient fraction of my project crystallises, but until then I'm just going to keep churning on ideas. Essentially, I need to understand enough that I can build a non-trivial prototype. It's hard to do that without an information model!</p>
<p>I'm not willing to believe that linguistics is a distraction yet. I'm only interested in the basics: I guess I want to understand what word classes, syntax, and grammar from a natural language might be useful as a basis for describing and manipulating the type of information found within a programming system. I probably don't want to go much further down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>By "more powerful model", I mean giving power to the programmer. I mean a model that makes it easy to express the things that a programmer might want to express, i.e. being possible is not enough. It's possible to model anything with a (souped-up) graph, I'm sure, but that doesn't help much.</p>
<p>I definitely think a better model exists. As I said before, the models we know about today were just invented by some creative people a few decades or centuries ago, usually as a tool to explore a particular domain. Nobody discovered graph theory in the Amazon rainforest or on the surface of Venus. There are some fundamental patterns that result from the physical laws of our universe (e.g. as reified in geometry), but the models we build around these patterns are typically layered with additional constraints. We have a new domain now: programming, and I think it's very possible to invent new models which are appropriate for the domain.</p>

Besides the domain-specific knowledge required, what‚Äôs the difference? Reminds me of Peter Thiel's thesis on Western society's recent inability to invent new technologies.</p>

Even if you do invent a totally new system, I still think existing logics are a better starting point than natural languages. AFAIK formal logic was evolved over centuries starting from natural language. Predicate logic in particular arises from similar questions to what you're asking. If you ignore all that experience, you're likely to end up tearing your hair out eventually. A logic database is already pretty close to an ideal data format anyway.</p>
<p>You might even want some nice computable fragment of higher order logic rather than first-order to capture the relationships between predicates/tags, though that may be overkill. I definitely think the innovation will be in the right way to cut a logic system down to fit the relatively simple problem of tagging.</p>

What makes a groundbreaking thing groundbreaking? I think that discovering groundbreaking new technologies is more a function of connecting a set of normally unrelated ideas together. Most breakthroughs and new technologies have been a slow iteration of new ideas based on old ones, experimentation and connecting unrelated ones. Take flying, for example. Powered flight actually arose nearly simultaneously in several places because the necessary supporting ideas were available, we just had to put them together. This is true of almost everything. I'm not sure if I agree with this, but maybe you could argue that we don't have groundbreaking technologies anymore because everything is groundbreaking. In the age of the internet, we iterate so fast and can so easily connect so many different ideas together that it has become utterly common place.</p>
<p>Truly groundbreaking technologies need to seem to come from nowhere. That is, there needs to be something mysterious in the source of it and it needs to fundamentally change the course of history. By the second measure, the internet, the iPhone, reusable space program, electric vehicles, batteries, cloud computing and so much more are in a very real sense changing nearly everything, except it's all mixed up and happening so fast that nothing looks groundbreaking anymore. Further, the mystery is gone in some sense. We have a really high quality record of where the innovations are coming from, what ideas are being combined and how. The internet is insane.</p>
<p>Take Newton for example. Newton did a lot of utterly absurdly groundbreaking work. But in large part, that is because 1) we have limited records of the thought processes and ideas that were connected to get there and 2) he had access to much of the knowledge of his time and 3) it stood out from it's contemporary work. I also think there is a component of groundbreaking work coming from a single mind where it has to be conceivable in a single mind and not a lot of minds were doing the conceiving. That is, Newton lived in an age where a single human mind could "discover gravity" as it were. I would argue that we have minds today that are able to conceive of, understand and "break ground" on vastly more complex and strange things than Newton ever did. What has changed is the environment, frequency and number of minds conceiving.</p>

Peter Thiel's "extended technological stagnation" is honestly laughable to me. It's been a sensational idea for a long time to figure out how to get the "world of tomorrow, today". His "extended" time period is a blip compared to the time scales things have taken historically. "We were promised flying cars and got 140 characters" is a straw man argument. Things are moving so fast right now that we literally can't keep up with the ground breaking consequences of it. We are swimming in so much ground breaking that we have forgotten it's the air we breath.</p>
<p>Also, who said 140 characters wasn't groundbreaking? Social media has fundamentally changed the world in so many ways for good or ill. Also, we have flying cars. Whether they are useful or just a novelty remains to be seen.</p>

<p>That said, it doesn't mean that you won't be able to crack it or at least discover something new and interesting. Keep an open mind to look at what you might think are completely unrelated fields or areas of thought. Often they hold the keys to innovation.</p>

We're not talking about tagging systems any more! (Warning: a very personal perspective follows)</p>
<p>Perhaps the word "groundbreaking" was too strong ‚Äî it has too many connotations. My point is that I refuse to dismiss the possibility that I can invent something wholly new. I get the vibe from people sometimes that they believe they can invent new products but not new models. At best, they take some model that already exists and tweak it, and I'm given advice to do the same. There's a big difference between products and models, and Silicon Valley only knows how to make software products (and occasionally hardware products), and even then... most software products have poor utility and/or ergonomics. Silicon Valley isn't pumping out much new computer science (relative to their size), except in very specific niches like machine learning. And don't get me started on academia: they stick to very specific niches that are "accepted" within their circles ‚Äî it's a game of conformity, or "micro-innovation".</p>
<p>New products are great, but there's a limit of how much we can achieve by building incrementally upon the ideas and the models that are already known to "work". You cited stuff like the iPhone and Elon's stuff: those are the exceptions, not the norm. Those were/are situations where people asked "what if we try designing from scratch?". The existing notions of what a "phone" or a "car" entailed were thrown away, even the core fundamentals like having buttons or (soon) having a driver. You can treat math the same way: there's nothing sacred about existing mathematical models. You can use them as inspiration whilst being fully prepared to move beyond what exists.</p>

I'm not willing to accept the conventional narratives on what is "realistic", because they're never based in fact: there's no real evidence to suggest that a (broadly) general purpose system (as opposed to a language) isn't possible. Domain-specific languages are always going to be "ideal" for their domains, so there is no universal language for computing, but a system is able to host these DSLs. The inbuilt language of the system itself is more about providing non-domain-specific notions like change. It's about providing a platform for these DSLs; something for them to be "compiled to", something universal.</p>
<p>Also, the term "ideal" is more about taking software to the "next level", the next stratum. I think there's room for more strata, but we can't even dream about what they'll be like yet. Horse riders probably imagined mechanical horses, but not self-driving (galloping?) pedestrian-aware mechanical horse taxis.</p>

I have often found my most paradigm shifting moves have been when I start to feel stuck in the mire of all the complexity. Life is complex, but mostly we tend to tack on artificial complexity. If you can step back and look at the fundamentals there is often a new model that is begging to get out of the problems space, but we were just too far down the path we started down to notice.</p>

<blockquote><p>Latency and Lag</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the time Profile‚Äôs system received camera-position information to Unreal‚Äôs rendering of the new position on the LED wall, there was about an 8 frame delay. This delay could be slightly longer if the signal had to also then be fed back to say a Steadicam operator. To allow for this when the team was rendering high resolution, camera-specific patches behind the actor (showing the correct parallax from the camera‚Äôs point of view) the team would actually render a 40% larger oversized patch. This additional error margin gave a camera operator room to pan or tilt and not see the edge of the patch before the system could catch up with the correct field of view.</p>

Search for 'union type'.</p>
<p>Basically structural typing addresses Rich hickey's criticism of Haskell. You don't always want int to match some union type containing ints. But it's good to give programmers the choice. Particularly for errors, it's good to be able to just return an int and have it automatically convert to <code>int|err</code>.</p>
<p>This approach to error checking feels more parsimonious than first class delimited continuations and algebraic effects.</p>

I'm thinking about improving CLIs while keeping what I like about them. One thing I'd like to improve is interactivity in the output. Different use cases require different levels of detail and currently, there's no way to change the level of detail once the result of a command is printed. For example, a lot of commands include <code>--verbose</code> options that perform the same action, but print additional output. So what if you could interactively decide what information to show in the output? This would allow more flexible / readable output and wouldn't require re-running commands to get additional information. In the tweet below, I mocked a simple example where a stack trace is hidden by default, but can be shown when needed. What do you think of this small idea?</p>

I'm currently not planning to actually implement this. Shells and terminals are a rabbit hole I don't want to get into right now. If I were to implement it though, I'd probably take the chance to rethink terminal interfaces from the ground up. Interactivity, rich formatting, multimedia content, terminal-program-communication, etc., I feel like there's still a lot of unused potential. And most importantly, I'd replace all the old stuff like ANSI escapes, <code>\r</code>, etc. with portable and clean 21th-century interfaces.</p>

<p>I actually expect the implementation of this idea to be a small project. The big one is providing enough output parsers for popular CLI tools to make it practically useful.</p>

There is a limit to how fast humans can learn, because learning and thinking is a physical process that involves the actual movement of atoms and building of biological cells. There's potentially huge, not well understood benefits to effort, toil and failure in long term knowledge acquisition and design.</p>
<p>There's potential catastrophes around superpowering one part of our abilities and not others, a bit like early attempts to eliminate sleep. I think <a href="https://twitter.com/ibdknox">Chris Granger</a> has written before about the benefits of pointless busywork in coding (manually balancing brackets, manual renames of variables etc). Sometimes confronting a problem in it's purest conceptual form is just too big chunks to chew.</p>
<p>So I would guess the "traffic jam" feels like those times when you actually have loads of time on your hands but you don't seem to be able to start anything because there's no little problems.</p>

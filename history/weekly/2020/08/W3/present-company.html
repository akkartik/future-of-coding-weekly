<p>This is a brand-new channel. It's our home for discussions about the present world â€” how we do programming today, how the world as it exists influences us, and generally any thoughts or questions about the here and now.</p>
<p>If you'd like help with your homework, this is the place to ask. If you wrote a new blog post about how to use <code>react-thingamabob</code>, this is the place to share it.</p>
<ul><li>Reflections on how the current world might influence the future go in <strong>#thinking-together</strong> â€” really, any thoughts about the future go there, even if they draw on the present or history.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2020-08-15T08:45:28.257Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Nick Smith</span> <a href="#2020-08-15T08:45:28.257Z" class="date">2020-08-15 08:45:28</a> <div class="message"><p>Wait what does "company" mean in the channel name?

We might be able to make something of that during the holiday season :p</p>
<p>Present company is part of a <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/324569/does-the-phrase-present-company-excepted-exclude-the-speaker-as-well-as-the-li"></a><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/324569/does-the-phrase-present-company-excepted-exclude-the-speaker-as-well-as-the-li">https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/324569/does-the-phrase-present-company-excepted-exclude-the-speaker-as-well-as-the-li</a>. Here's an example of how it's usually used: Let's say this is some high fantasy setting, and we're in a party together. I'm an elf, and you're a human. You might say outwardly "I've never met an elf I could respect," then looking at me, "present company excepted."</p>
<p>It's "company" in the sense of the people around you â€” both in the future of speech and as used for this channel. The word "present", then, has a double meaning for us â€”&nbsp;it's meant to mean both "here" as in we are all in this place, and "now" as in this is the channel where we talk about matters of the present day.</p>
<p>This is the channel where we all discuss matters of the here and now, drawing on the expertise and breadth of experience that this community has brought together.</p>
<p>Our other name ideas for this channel were all too narrow in their scope â€“ eg: #present-of-programming didn't leave the door open to discussions of slightly more off-topic things, which is something I want this channel to be available for. I also wanted to put the focus on the fact that the people in this community are all alive in the present and there's a value to us all being together.</p>

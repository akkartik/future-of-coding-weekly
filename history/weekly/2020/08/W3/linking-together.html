I have that thought too.</p>
<p>But I inevitably end up standing on the other side of that line in the sand. I'm almost always in the "designing languages / frameworks" mentality, and I like to play with different kinds of syntax or call signatures or conventions just to learn more about the pain and pleasure of any given variation from the norm. It's nice to be able to do that a little bit while still benefitting from all the infrastructure of JS and in the context of an actual product/serious project, rather than (say) having to write my own language and then figure out how to have an ecosystem around it and then find some sort of toy example project to build in it.</p>

It's so immediately understandable to me, maybe because it's sufficiently close to the status quo, although it's also such a real demo and design. It just rings true and you are certain it would work and be useful. I think this is because the creator is making it for their own needs.</p>

<p>Or are you thinking something like... <code>arr[x] = fn(arr[x])</code>, but where the function somehow knows about the array so that you can just call it like <code>fn(arr[x])</code> and it takes care of updating the array?</p>
<p>Or are you basically asking for <code>become:</code>? Your domain / hyperlink example makes it seem like that's what you're after, and in this case the fact that arrays are involved is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Let me know what you want the calling context to look like, and I'll see if I have anything in one of my dustier tomes.</p>

<p>specifically i‚Äôm experimenting with going all out on the idea of message networks (making up this vocab as i go along)‚Äîso instead of <code>map</code> or <code>cata</code>, i‚Äôm seeing if i can do stuff like have arrays ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù messages to their children recursively. something like:</p>
<p><code>Array.prototype.broadcast = function(message) {
this.map(i =&gt; i.broadcast? i.broadcast(message) : i[message]``()``)
}</code></p>
<p>so ideally the objects in an array would update themselves in-place without having to reassign at the array-level/parent-level abstraction, if that makes sense</p>

(This is from Brent Simmons, the developer of NetNewsWire, one of the most popular native Mac apps ever.) I‚Äôm particularly fascinated that the web has been so successful on the desktop (although really only in the last five years ago for use cases I personally care about, like creative apps) ‚Äî but on mobile native apps are far more popular than the web. Both of these things are strange to me: That native is so much more popular than the web on mobile, and that it took so long for the web to make inroads for so many important uses cases on desktop. <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/08/15/desktop_means_web"></a><a href="https://inessential.com/2020/08/15/desktop_means_web">https://inessential.com/2020/08/15/desktop_means_web</a></p>

I've seen many of them before, but I now have a personal knowledge base that is big enough for the insights of his talks to really hit me. I'm impressed with Rich's level of insight (even though it may be scoped to Clojure at times), and so I'd strongly recommend people to check out his most popular talks. There's an exhaustive list <a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub"></a><a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub">https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub</a>. Some of my favourites:</p>
<ul><li>Simple Made Easy (for learning how to evaluate whether your language constructs are well-designed)</li><li>The Value of Values (building upon Simple Made Easy, it asks us to reconsider the information models we define for our programming systems)</li><li>Are We There Yet (building upon The Value of Values, it suggests how we could model time and change in a value-centric programming system)</li><li>Spec-ulation (asks us to reconsider semantic versioning and APIs)</li><li>Effective Programs ‚Äì 10 Years of Clojure (a big-picture talk that revises all of the prior talks, and makes some additional points)</li></ul><p>For the record, I've never used Clojure. So don't be fooled into thinking that his talks are only relevant to people who are interested in Clojure.</p>

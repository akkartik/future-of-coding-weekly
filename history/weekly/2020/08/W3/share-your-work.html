This is a feasibility prototype built for Svelte. The core of it is quite simple. At build time, it transforms component definitions to fetch their dependent components from a dependency store rather than importing them from the filesystem. Component source files are emitted as part of the build, and the Svelte compiler is added to the page. Now you can pull up the source of any component, make changes, and rebuild it from within the browser.</p>
<p>This week, I'm working on building experimental development tooling from within this architecture, so hopefully I'll be able to share more interesting functionality by the weekend.</p>

<p>More than a year ago, I have try something like that, but with Vue.js and using the hot reload stuff but to compile in the browser the modifications. I haven't work again on this, but I thought to reuse it somehow. And even wonder if Svelte would also be a good fit for this kind of scenario. You have just answered that! 😄</p>
<p>I don't really know Svelte (never code) but I really like the concept, and I have to try it. Even if for now I guess I will stick to Vue.js for most of my work.</p>
<p>Anyway, keep going, I am very impatient to see the next iteration!</p>

I'd make a change to one file, and an unexpectedly large portion of the screen would refresh, throwing out state that shouldn't have been thrown out. Plus, hot-reloading relies on architecture outside the browser. This prototype pushes the build and update cycle into the browser as plain JS, so it can be deployed as a static site.</p>

<ul><li>Yes, that vim-like feel is what I was going for.</li><li>I agree, I think the discovery portion of the CSS isn't much of a change. What really stands out to me, though, is the elimination of the reload and the family navigation mechanic. What I was striving for as I built it was being able to press a single key to iterate through my options without any feedback delay and without having to manually copy changes from the browser back to the source. The shortcut mechanism was intended more for experienced developers who know what they want and want to reduce the number of keystrokes required to say it.</li><li>Yes, the 4-space formatting is intentional. Since it's a prototype, I hard-coded my formatting preferences rather than making them modifiable. But in my defense, it wouldn't be an issue if the AST were a first-class member of the development process. Ideally, I should be able to hand the AST directly to an independent formatter. As it stands, it was easier to rely on the existing integration of formatters/linters into the workflow than to try to integrate those tools directly into the extension or expose the recast printing options. The HTML printer also does some weird stuff with multiple attributes if you haven't noticed that yet.</li><li>The composition API would make life more interesting, but it's intended for more challenging use cases. I haven't had to design anything quite that complicated, so I have no mental models for the process. I wouldn't know what tooling to build, but I suspect it would be closer to a projectional editor than this "smart snippets" thing.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-08-13T09:11:50.479Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Nuno Leiria</span> <a href="#2020-08-13T09:11:50.479Z" class="date">2020-08-13 09:11:50</a> <div class="message"><p>Hi <strong>@Cameron King</strong>, this looks great! Are you able to go a bit deeper into the technical details of how you achieve liveness? I'm familiar with ASTs but not with Vue or Tailwind, if that helps.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-08-13T12:42:54.479Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Cameron King</span> <a href="#2020-08-13T12:42:54.479Z" class="date">2020-08-13 12:42:54</a> <div class="message"><p>Sure! I'm not sure what you mean by "liveness", but if you're referring to the CSS feedback cycle, the details aren't particular to the technologies.</p>
<ul><li>To skip waiting for the project to rebuild, the extension opens a WebSocket connection between the editor and the browser. To start the connection, the user has to drop a snippet into their <code>main.js</code> they get through the extension command <code>alt+o ss</code>.</li><li>Through that connection, the extension sends <code>edit-class</code> events, which target an element with a specific <code>data-olympus</code> attribute and add/remove the given classes on it.</li><li>The <code>data-olympus</code> attribute is added to the source code of a given component via an extension command (<code>alt+o ai</code>)</li><li>In the editor, rather than editing class lists directly, the user goes through an input that's summoned by an extension command (<code>alt+o et</code>). Every time the user adds/removes a class, the extension patches the classes on the corresponding AST node and reprints the source, and sends an event through the WebSocket with the appropriate payload.</li></ul><p>It could be more elegant and efficient. Editing through the AST isn't necessary, but it was quicker development-wise to work with objects and call <code>.toString()</code> than to work with locations in the underlying string representation. I'm also not a fan of the <code>data-olympus</code> attribute, but it was the quickest way to map identity between AST nodes and live DOM nodes. Neither do I love that the user has to drop a snippet into their source code, but it didn't feel worth publishing an NPM package to hide the snippet. Ideally, the snippet would be part of the build system and included/excluded based on the environment.</p>

I have a very small Rust experience. As small as reading half of "Programming Rust" from O'Reilly, start coding in Rust, trying to replicate other languages habits, struggle with lot's of compiler error messages, finally actually understand the hard way that habits must change, unperfectly change them, implement some basic toy CRDT algorithm in Rust (which target WebAssembly for use in the browser), forget about all of this (it was one year ago and I didn't use Rust again since).</p>
<p>For your first question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the process of interpreting a type error make sense? Does it ring true to your own experience (in Rust or other languages?)Yes, completely. And especially with Rust. Even if my memory of Rust is a bit... rusty (sorry for the bad pun...) and even if I didn't catch very well all your code examples (maybe I read it too fast too) reading the discussion totally makes sense and resonates with what I have experienced. To be precise on one point: I didn't write any unsafe code, even if there were several cases where it can be a solution. But as I was learning, and it strongly feels against the Rust idea, and that it seems complicated to write (and need to learn new things like you point in the article), I didn't do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for the other question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you learn something new? Does this paper help you understand/frame the usability challenges about Rust specifically, or potentially a different language?Totally, it is a kind of global 'aha' moment too for me. All your points are like I felt them during my Rust experience but didn't really grasp or "put a name" on it. Especially, it wasn't clear to me that some compiler errors were due to incompletness, and I feel like knowing this would have been of great help in the way to manage the compiler and its messages, and knowing it now will definitely helps me in my future Rust experience (if any).</p>

<p>It's useful to have this distinction, because you sometimes want to make a stencil from two objects, for example a rectangle and a circle on top of each other, and then outline that once.</p>
<p>So that'd be something like:</p>

<p>That's still declarative, I'd say, but we're getting into weird-terminology-park here. I'd rather think about what benefit does this API have over another? I know I resort to using 'imperative' and 'declarative' sometimes, but in this case these APIs look and behave the same.</p>
<p>So, going a little bit on a stretch: Declarative and imperative aren't opposites. Declarative APIs can be implemented with declarative code.</p>

<p>I like your declarative language for vector graphics, and the way it seems to be good at composition: you can combine stencils in more complex stencils, and only after that applying some style to it. I like that you explicitly focus on "shape" first (your "stencil", nice name) a concept that come before how it is rendered. First time I see it. I guess there are some other languages for graphics that use the same kind of model.</p>
<p>I also like the way you illustrate the type checking with Scratch like blocks. And even if you write in the article that it is just for illustration, I find this is a good example of that sometime visual languages can be more expressive than text. In that case it is visually obvious that you are not allowed to put a "rectangle" block in a "moved" one, with text programming you have to figure it yourself, or the editor linter or compiler can tell you are doing something wrong, but only after doing it, in the visual I don't even try to do it.</p>

<blockquote><p>As someone who isn‚Äôt embedded in the Smalltalk world, many of the nouns in GT blog posts are not clear to me. For example, this quote seems really profoundIndeed, we do think this is rather significant. At the same time, we are still catching up with explaining these implications in ways that do not require prior Smalltalk knowledge. That is why specific questions or challenges do help us a lot.</p>

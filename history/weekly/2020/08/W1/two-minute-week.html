<p>Lately I'm most excited by two ideas:</p>
<ul><li><p>"Show all the data," as Pane puts it (<a href="http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane"></a><a href="http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane">http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane</a>)</p>
</li><li><p>Embodied instruction pointer, as championed by <a href="https://github.com/batman-nair/IRCIS"></a><a href="https://github.com/batman-nair/IRCIS">https://github.com/batman-nair/IRCIS</a> and <strong>@nicolas decoster</strong>'s <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1594669872107700"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1594669872107700">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1594669872107700</a></p>
</li></ul><p>This demo kinda engages with the first. I'm still noodling on how to whether there's a clean way to work in the second.</p>

I also once designed(but never implemented) a spreadsheet for trees. For the use-cases I was imagining, it felt important that authors have control over the layout(I like how PANE is free-form too)- I'm curious what your thoughts/inklings there are.</p>
<p>I'm super intrigued by the notion of having an embodied instruction-pointer in a spreadsheet, I'm rooting for you to figure it out! ObservableHQ kinda does this with their cells, which highlight when the value changes. I wonder if a minimap might be helpful here?</p>

It feels like a good balance between document like presentation and dynamic data injection. I like that a record is inserted and modified in the document but that it can also relate to a database. I also like a lot the way you render the structure (with the light red lines/trees): it is very expressive yet not to much intrusive. It is also a good balance between constraints placement with some bit of freedom in layout (horizontal/vertical).</p>
<p>Why didn't you implement it? Do you plan to use some of it in the future?</p>
<p>Anyway, it is a good source of inspiration, thanks a lot for sharing! üôÇ</p>

I remain very interested in the general idea of tree editors like what Kartik is exploring tho.</p>

That layout matters, and that adjusting opacity is key. Mostly I'm just trying to do something with the extreme constraints I'm forced to operate under at the moment. Thank you for giving me new ideas.</p>

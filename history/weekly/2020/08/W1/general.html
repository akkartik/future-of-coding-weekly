<p>Subject-Oriented Programming (A Critique of Pure Objects)</p>
<p>This essay critiques the idea that it is possible and desirable to put all of the information needed to interpret an object inside the object itself. Different applications or modules may interpret the same data in different ways, and you can't always plan for all of these interpretations in advance.</p>

I've seen class libraries for computer graphics where there are separate Point3 and Vector3 classes (for points and vectors in 3D space). That's too much self-description for my taste. In the graphics languages I use, a point and a vector have the same representation, as a generic 1D array of numbers, viz: [x,y,z]. If I store one of these values in a record, then the field name will informally indicate whether the value is being interpreted as a vector or a point. No need for the value [x,y,z] to be self describing as well.</p>
<p>If you have too little self description, code gets cryptic. Like in old-style Lisp programming, where you use lists for everything (no records or maps).</p>

The problem I'm trying to solve is: when you give a data set to someone (a human or a device), how are they supposed to figure out its meaning? Or rather, what is the best way to do so? Send them an email explaining the meaning? Or something more formal and machine-friendly.</p>

<p><strong>@Nick Smith</strong> Isn‚Äôt that what a taxonomy is all about?</p>
<p>When I think about self-describing data, I‚Äôm most interested in in-band vs. out-of-band transmission. </p>
<p>Some parts of a data format need to be agreed on out-of-band. That could be generic assumptions like endianess, that a string is encoded in UTF-8 or that a field in the UI only takes a valid email address. If that‚Äôs just assumed, these assumptions need to be transmitted out-of-band, i.e. on a different channel which could be that email you mentioned or is just ‚Äúobvious‚Äù within a community (side note: there‚Äôs danger of exclusion here).</p>
<p>Self-describing data formats transmit more information in-band, as part of the data. So there is an explicit part of the data that says what follows is UTF-8 or there‚Äôs a mime type that indicates here comes an image or JavaScript, or you go all the way and end up in semantic web land with those unique, agreed upon entities described in RDF and OWL.</p>
<p>The question to me is: how much of a data format can and should be described explicitly in-band? </p>
<p>And the interesting challenges hiding under there are: encoding structure vs. content and what is data vs. what is metadata?</p>

<blockquote><p>The question to me is: how much of a data format can and should be described explicitly in-band?Serialisation formats are not a language or environment concern, they're an implementation concern, and I'm acting as a language/environment designer rather than implementer as of late, so I'm not focusing on that stuff. But I'm interested in how the semantics of a data object are presented to the user! Which is closely related. If you're on that bandwagon, then sure, that's the question üôÇ</p>

This is a hard topic to discuss with the same rigour as computer science or PL design but I think it is one of the most important topics for this community to tackle.</p>
<p>To help bring some rigour to this conversation I‚Äôd like to bring up some incredibly important academic work which you can check out should you want to. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism</a> (these models aren‚Äôt in competition) are two of the best and most current models of economics, and could not exist without computing. They are both worthy of your time and have lots of explanatory and predictive power. They also point to a very important point for us: The technical challenge alone will not fix computing, nor will design. It‚Äôs not as simple as changing the incentives for companies or decentralising software, and not as straightforward as improving coding by a few orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>So, if we as a community want to change coding forever and for good, we must also understand the societal, political and economic context we exist in. I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts and discuss this but want to guide this conversation away from some pitfalls and towards productive conversation.</p>
<p>Things we don‚Äôt need to discuss:</p>
<ul><li>Personal opinions on wether capitalism sucks or not</li><li>Opinions on social media or corporate giants and their many problems or evils</li><li>The kind of discussions and critiques we have again and again all over social media around capitalism, Web 2.0, platforms, giant tech companies, etcetera.</li></ul><p>Some things this community could benefit from discussing:</p>
<ul><li>Concrete research and resources to learn more, inform ourselves and each other.</li><li>Ways in which we can facilitate true systemic change through our work here.</li><li>Questions that we think are worth exploring</li><li>Ways for this community to keep growing its understanding of economic context, the complex structures behind them, and improve our collective reasoning and decision making.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2020-07-27T13:47:48.137Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jack Rusher</span> <a href="#2020-07-27T13:47:48.137Z" class="date">2020-07-27 13:47:48</a> <div class="message"><p>With regards to how one might have the benefits of market societies without the inhumanity of them, I rather like <a href="https://www.globalutmaning.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2011/01/Davos-The-nordic-way-final.pdf"></a><a href="https://www.globalutmaning.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2011/01/Davos-The-nordic-way-final.pdf">https://www.globalutmaning.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2011/01/Davos-The-nordic-way-final.pdf</a> as a starting point:</p>
<blockquote><p>[O]ne can discern over the course of the twentieth century an overarching ambition in the Nordic countries not to socialize the economy but to&nbsp;&gt; liberate the individual citizen from all forms of subordination and dependency&gt; &nbsp;within the family and in civil society:&nbsp;&gt; the poor from charity, the workers from their employers, wives from their husbands, children from parents ‚Äì and vice versa when the parents become elderly&gt; &nbsp;[‚Ä¶] legislation has made the Nordic countries into the least family-dependent and most individualized societies on the face of the earth. To be sure, the family remains a central social institution in the Nordic countries, but it too is infused with the same moral logic stressing autonomy and equality. The ideal family is made up of adults who work and are not financially dependent on the other, and children who are encouraged to be as independent as early as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[... and particularly this statement about love ...]</p>
<p>[A]uthentic relationships of love and friendship are only possible between individuals who do not depend on each other or stand in unequal power relations. Thus autonomy, equality and (statist) individualism are inextricably linked to each other.That said, I also have sympathy for Freinacht's concerns about personal freedoms within these sorts of structures.</p>

Like, if someone is pro-accelerationism, would certain kinds of projects be more or less difficult in such a world? If the political future I believe in is incompatible with the technological future I'm exploring, that would be super useful to know early. If there are no such constraints, then this feels like a complementary subject where we can "cleave nature at the joints".</p>
<p>As an example, I think a fundamental property of software is that it can't be delegated without exposing oneself to unbounded risk of being pwned, at some point in the long-term future. This leads me to trust extrinsically motivated (for pay) software less than intrinsically motivated, and small-scale software over large (because of the need to maintain relationships with one's dependencies). That worldview further leads, inevitably, to a world where software is developed primarily by those who can make ends meet by other means besides the software they write. If you trust someone enough to use their software, it seems to me, money can't be more than a tiny part of that relationship. This is an uncomfortable realization for me, because I'd love to live in a world where everyone can contribute to open source, rather than just the modern equivalent of gentleperson scientists in the Enlightenment. More background reading on my worldview: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi</a></p>
<p>We don't need to debate the pros and cons of different schools here, but it might be interesting to take on frames of reference and explore implications.</p>

<p>by building software, languages and ideas that make it possible for smaller groups of people to build larger systems</p>
<p>By aligning our software projects with ideas that are compatible with a good future (truly owning data, trustless systems like decentralised apps, avoiding centralised platforms, making sure user data is not central to profit incentives)</p>
<p>And perhaps most significantly, help ourselves and each other understand long-term possibilities in the transformation of our collective political philosophy so that we can (as individuals and collectively) help to transform politics and political discussion to change what‚Äôs possible in terms of the projects, organisations, and companies that we build.</p>
<p>An example of this would be a nation transitioning to an economics build around automation, universal basic income and an intentional move towards eradicating work (wage labour).</p>
<p>You may not think that‚Äôs the way to go, and that‚Äôs fine because the point is that it‚Äôs an example of a long-term philosophical shift that changes the things we can do, we‚Äôd all have different constraints on time and money which would change a lot of what we can do (in real-world, practical terms). This is sometimes referred to as a type of freedom. Today we have negative freedom, this would be a type of synthetic freedom. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/"></a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/</a> the ideas are explained well in a different context.

<p>A fantastic fresh perspective can be found in the book Walden 2.0, written by one of the top behavioral theorists of the last 100 years. It's a utopian novel that wrestles very well with the implications of things like universal basic income, but  has I think a superior model. It is however a difficult book to come by.</p>

<p>Let me try and connect the discussion to this community:</p>
<p>Within our political economic system we are by default second hand dealers in ideas. We are not the source of impactful political ideas because we think of computing, not of politics.</p>
<p>Importantly, we do interact with the people and knowledge within political thinking, but usually through media, conversations, social media, etcetera.</p>
<p>Regardless of what we do we will be thinking about, spreading and interacting with deep systems of political theory, economics, and so on. </p>
<p>Work by people in the field where politics is almost as code is to us. It is knowable, sometimes objective and academic political thinking accumulates and spreads over time.</p>
<p>So for us, who already have a world of things to do and think about, it is not a world we can really participate in. But if we take it as true that we interact with political research, theory, and philosophy indirectly, I think we owe it to ourselves to try.</p>
<p>This can‚Äôt be done by trying to get everyone to discuss thousands of papers, research, blog posts and articles so it seems the best thing we can do as a community is focus directly on facilitating and understand the hard work others are doing.</p>
<p>If I were to start this thread again the above is maybe where I‚Äôd start.</p>

<p><strong>@Orion Reed</strong> I mostly agree with you on the goals. Amplifying small groups, data sovereignty, avoiding centralization, UBI, these are all the way to go for sure. The challenge for me is how to discuss these ideas in a productive way without pulling in the whole universe into this thread. (Paraphrasing Carl Sagan, step 1 to baking apple pie is a big bang.) How can we programmers here ease into the practice of reasoning about the political "type systems" that influence our lives?</p>
<p>The way I've been trying to manage complexity is to have some hazy sense that the software I create is likely to foster the world I want to move towards, and then forget about politics and focus on the thing I can contribute. But this doesn't feel like an ideal level of integration for sure. How can it be improved?</p>
<p>You're right that software depends more on politics than the other way around. But it also depends more on physics than the other way around. Does that mean we need to also discuss physics? Or is there a different, less reductionist, axis that matters more?</p>
<p>At the risk of seeming to toot my own horn, I recently described how my political goals drive my side project in <a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf">http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf</a>. Hopefully it shows that we share many of the same political goals, and that I'm not averse to discussing capitalism here. I've expressed similar sentiments to yours in the past in this group, about the need to discuss the context software is embedded in. Another recent thread that you may like is <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595017818433700"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595017818433700">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595017818433700</a></p>
<p><a href="https://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> my reaction to independent bodies auditing code is twofold:</p>
<ul><li><p>Ugh, that'll squeeze out all that's new and great about software.</p>
</li><li><p>That'll never never work, because software is changing too fast, and auditors will always lag auditees in knowhow.</p>
</li></ul><p>Perhaps my opinion is colored by only having experienced regulation in India and the US.</p>

<p>On a tangent, can I recommend batching up your comments? I think that will help facilitate the discussion you want to have. Just hit send less often üôÇ It'll make the conversation seem more balanced between different voices. I also find that it naturally makes the prose tighter (I'm more likely to edit text I haven't sent yet), and so easier for someone to follow.

<p>I used to work professionally as an auditor, and agree with you completely in your critiques. The focus on the "physics" side rather then the "politics" side of programming is what makes it so magical. It is much easier for politicians to lie than it is for scientists.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://corecursive.com/"></a><a href="https://corecursive.com/">https://corecursive.com/</a>" is a good overview of a wide range of "survey of different programming languages" type topics.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcast/"></a><a href="https://oxide.computer/podcast/">https://oxide.computer/podcast/</a>" by Oxide computer company is amazing if you are interested in hardware at all. Even if you aren't, it's worth listening to for the history. They interview some real giants from the early days of Silicon Valley. Jeff Rothschild for example, as well as Jonathan Blow.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/"></a><a href="https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/">https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/</a>" - I found out about this podcast from the Miller Puckette episode of FOC. It's centered around an electronic music niche, but there are some fascinating nuggets there.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/"></a><a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/">https://brainsciencepodcast.com/</a>" - not directly CS or Code related, but if you are interested in AI or Philosophy of Mind, or anything related to how the brain works, this podcast is highly underrated. Dr. Campbell is a medical doctor, and she interviews many top neuroscience researchers. It can get a bit technical with some neuro-science specific jargon, but she always makes an effort to make it understandable to wider audience.</p>
<p>The latest I have tried is, "<a href="https://generativeartistry.com/episodes/"></a><a href="https://generativeartistry.com/episodes/">https://generativeartistry.com/episodes/</a>". I just started this one. It is interesting, but I'm not sure of the substantive content yet.</p>

A lot of times this document has the code changes required by any of the solution options.</p>
<p>To me the options that we didn't end up following seem as valuable as the chosen option, and those options should also be captured in code. A really easy way could be in separate branches, but then we loose visibility of them.</p>
<p>Is anybody familiar with source control software or with patterns to work with source control that also keeps tracks of options considered but not followed at the end?</p>

<blockquote><p>‚ÄúBeing a creator of and steward for Flash as a platform was a privilege. I felt that we were building a pencil and it was the community of creators that was responsible for the creation of Flash as a creative form. Our job as stewards was to anticipate needs, listen and make sure it worked. The core idea of having an accessible system for creating interactive media content that works across a range of devices is still a powerful one. Just like pencil and paper is a powerful tool. I hope it will happen again. Many years ago, I had the idea of Flash Forever. How can we treat what is created in Flash as valuable information like a book? Sadly, the need to drive business growth by adding features and capabilities, trumped the need for permanence. It‚Äôs great that Flash still lives in the skills and experiences of the community of people who learned and grew with it.‚Äù -- Jonathan Gay,  Creator of Flash</p>

The problem with Unity/Unreal for the web is their based around heavy assets and textures so even simple games end up being 10-20-50meg. Of course someone with experience can design a game around small assets but the default is encourage large bitmapped assets whereas Flash defaulted to vectors and yes, vectors are both small and very compressible</p>
<p>Flash did "stream". It ordered the data in the order of the timeline and would execute frames as soon as they downloaded without having to wait for the entire file to download. If you put a script on one of those early frames it would execute immediately. This made it trivial to have a 8meg file but present the user an interactive experience when only 50k or 100k of that 8meg file had downloaded.</p>
<p>The most common usage was just to display a custom progress bar. You'd put a script on the first frame that just watched the rest the file load and drew some kind of progress bar but there were plenty of flash files that started the first part of their game or gave you a character editing screen or something else while they continued to download the rest of the file.</p>
<p>In any case. The important part is the user not having to wait to start interacting. Compression is important but not sufficient. Just the ability to start before loading everything is also not sufficient IMO. The tools need to make this dead simple. In raw JS and with most JS based engines this is entirely left as an exercise for advanced users only. In Flash it was the norm. The format started as streamed vector graphics without scripting. Scripting was bolted on later but because it started as a streamed format that ability to give the user an interactive experience quickly ended up being built in from the start.</p>

The rest was added later. But as an example if you add music to a flash file the music data will be interleaved in each frame for streaming. HTML/JS provides no native way to do this. You'd have to make your own file format and then parse the packets of the file yourself and pass off the audio packets to the WebAudio API via the JavaScriptProcessNode or an AudioWorker. In other words it would be a fairly advanced HTML/JS library whereas in Flash it was built in.  This is why embedding WASM as in HTML or even putting assets in a WASM file isn't a solution.</p>
<p>You can read about all this stuff in the docs for the format. From the intro</p>
<blockquote><p> It is designed to meet the following goals: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Network delivery‚ÄîThe format can travel over a network with limited and unpredictable bandwidth. The files are compressed to be small and support incremental rendering through streaming....</li></ul><p>Streamed audio packets interleaved with the frames are covered around page 181</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/swf-file-format-spec.pdf"></a><a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/swf-file-format-spec.pdf">https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/swf-file-format-spec.pdf</a></p>
<p>How much of this stuff is important in 2020 I have no idea. Flash started in the 90s when having a modem was still the most common way to connect. But still, it definitely streamed and designed around getting something to the user as fast as possible.</p>

I wasn't aware that Flash supported streaming in that way. That was very advanced for the time.</p>
<p>The interleaved audio implementation is also very interesting! It's something I hadn't considered.</p>
<blockquote><p>The important part is the user not having to wait to start interacting.I used the phrase, "time to first interaction". But I think we agree here. :amiga-tick:</p>
<p>In other words it would be a fairly advanced HTML/JS library whereas in Flash it was built in.I agree, that kind of streaming would be fairly complex to emulate, but It is technically possible to with today's technology (at least for desktop). The implementation would probably be a nightmare, but it's technically doable...</p>
<p>How much of this stuff is important in 2020 I have no idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The billion dollar question is, is it worth emulating?</p>
<p>To clarify, the reason I'm digging into this so hard is because I'm trying to see what if any useful bits of wisdom are worth taking from Flash as a technology that may have been passed over in modern tech.</p>

<p>This might seem to some like a joke (and I don't want to derail the topic ‚Äî if this is something others here would like to discuss, we should spin up a separate thread), but I'm being sincere.</p>
<p>LSD!</p>
<p>It's a crying shame that it is so heavily criminalized, and so taboo, and associated with (frankly) very tacky parts of culture. Taking it was a revelatory experience, and offered me a sort of "everything all at once" frame of mind that I can now tap into whenever I need.</p>
<p>I'd rank it up there with (say) acting in plays and travel, as experiences which are accessible only to very fortunate people, which can offer profound awareness of life and humanity (though do not guarantee it, of course).</p>

<p>The most influential things for me are probably Alan Kay's videos and writings (e.g. <a href="https://vimeo.com/82301919"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/82301919">https://vimeo.com/82301919</a>).

I do think he doesn't provide concrete action items but certainly provides direction - both in terms of what kinds of ideas to pursue, what kinds of design attributes to look for, and what kinds of institutions and processes may work. It's true most of this talks are like Kay 101, and mostly intended to 'hook' the audience into 'recognizing the problem'. Some VPRI writings get more into ideas on fixing things - though looks like that part of the site is gone unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's a deeply unfair question, much like asking a cryptography developer why their code is used to let criminals operate without getting caught. It fits together because the Rust community doesn't have control over everyone who downloads the code, just the interactions in official forums. This is implicit in the concept of an open source project.</p>
<p>More on topic, everyone in this community should be reconciled with the fact that if they are sufficiently successful, their work will eventually be used for evil and they won't be able to stop it. That's what it means to build tools.</p>

Communities with a good CoC have in them a recognition of such power dynamics, since that's what the CoC would have emerged from. Surveillance is a tool that reinforces and entrenches similar power imbalances in the broader public sphere ‚Äî so it'd make sense for the folks who write these CoCs, who have this sensitivity to power, to want to do what they can to protest surveillance. To me, the tweet makes perfect sense and I completely see the connection.</p>
<p>The question becomes, what can those CoC-authoring, power-levelling folks do about the problem of their work being coopted for <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595686084036400"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595686084036400">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595686084036400</a>?</p>
<p>That might seem like an irrelevant matter. If so, you probably first need to decide how you feel about power imbalances in general.</p>
<p>It might seem like an intractable problem. Well, computing cultures through history are full of people making great efforts, some more successful than others, to address these exact sorts of issues. Decentralization, copyleft, FOSS, ubiquitous CoCs, the startup model, torrenting, tor, hacking, C3, the list goes on and on. I think it's totally within the realm of possibility that if a community like Rust wanted to take a stand against surveillance, or the military-industrial complex, folks within that community (or adjacent to it, or intersecting with it) might birth such a movement that produces a new counterculture.</p>

<p>Every time a new ‚Äúfuture‚Äù of coding app is presented, and it only works with mouse and keyboard and requires a large screen I‚Äôm a little sad of the missed opportunity.Interesting topic, that I'd like to bike-shed think about together.</p>
<p>I fully agree that touch devices and small screen devices are opportunities to imagine new way for programming. But I feel that it is quite hard to address. In particular small screens. Even with text programming, I always feel the need for a big screens. I can't imagine doing this on a phone.</p>
<p>And for visual programming, having large screen make it possible to adopt some "map kind" organisation of your programming artifacts, to have nice global view of what your are doing.</p>
<p>And something that is challenging, it to design visual representation/manipulation that works well for both large screen/keyboard'n mouse and small screen/touch.</p>
<p>What do you think of that? Is there some examples of programming environment that succeeded in this space?</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<p>I have two monitors set up while coding. On one monitor I have my code editor, and the other monitor has some reference. This is all fairly standard.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times I wanted to scroll or do some operation on the reference monitor, but the text editor was set to the active application, so I accidentally scrolled the code instead of the reference, loosing my place. Harmless, but quite annoying, especially in a complicated code base.</p>
<p>If I had eye tracking, the interface could detect what I was looking at, and keep the correct window active.</p>
<p>This is a pedestrian example, but I think there is a lot of powerful UX that could be enabled through decent eye tracking.</p>

For me that would probably be fine, since I'm a touch typist and like to use Keystrokes/vim for navigation; but I'm not sure how anyone would cope without those things.  I'm also not sure how tiring it would be ; I imagine being locked in a world like that would be become quite draining if you did it for the usual amount of hours....    The text editing isn't the only problem of course; you'd need debugger, etc; and presumably the application you were working on would have to present itself inside VR.</p>
<p>I've spent quite a while thinking about live coding inside such a thing.  I posted a link to Media Molecule's Dreams VR.  I don't know how they handle such things; I haven't watched it all yet.</p>

In contrast a software developer would be typically limited to the equivalent 1-3 pieces of paper.</p>

My biggest prejudgement is the physical ergonomics of user interaction. The same way touch screens across keyboards are only marginally useful.</p>

As a general perspective I really like the conceptual overview of Yuval Noah harari - sapiens <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens</a> from which I borrow from the chapter - the unification of mankind -three orders: 1. Empire 2. Religious order 3. Money.  Now it‚Äôs really interesting how money and coinage was linked to empire (faking coins would harshly be punished as crime against the crown) so from the beginning there is a interesting interplay between monopolies of power and aspects of collaboration. Now lately there have been people explaining crypto currencies as a kind of printing press technology which means it posses the potential of democratising access to currencies. I think in the capitalism thread we had arguments stating that culture is largely an emergent phenomenon. As such our ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù state of civilisation is , well , our best effort and a aggregation of all that had come before. Even now for a single person to perceive the culture of science is quite a difficult adventure. (Though I would it really recommend it to Steven diehl- but I think he somehow likes to remain in the doing science space rather then introspecting science space ) So as a technology for potential impact on culture crypto currencies have huge potential to be used for actual a better  and more positive live. And it this that I miss from Stevens criticism. That he acknowledges that crypto could have positive impact. I agree with him that ‚Äúnon-productive‚Äù assets are a failure of the economic system. I also agree with him that most crypto projects are sadly located near that realm. </p>

<p>I've seen many of the people on this forum also post on PKM on twitter, so I'm sure there's latent interest.</p>
<p>It feels borderline as a full community discussion - this thread alone might get relocated over to #random - but I wonder if there should be a #thought-tools or #knowledge-management channel so we can freely explore frontiers of knowledge tools &amp; concepts that aren't necessarily coding-based. cc <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion">Ivan Reese</a> </p>

<p>Alan Kay argued that ‚Äúthe term ‚Äòtool‚Äô implies a certain narrowness. A more powerful aim is to develop a new&nbsp;medium for thought.‚Äù and I believe Bret Victor seems to also use medium as the more denotational term. Another used by Alan, Bret, and others is new representations.</p>
<p>I feel like ‚Äòrepresentations‚Äô are the concrete language of the medium, ‚Äòtools‚Äô are like applied representations (i.e. Illustrator is kinda like an applied but restricted tool for bezier curves and vector geometry with extra bits). The idea of a medium being computational and dynamic seems to demand a higher bar when evaluating future projects.</p>
<p>I think you can argue that Illustrator is a tool for thought more easily than a medium for thought, as the medium would map to the domain-space of vector geometry itself.</p>

By this I mean an abstract model (not a DRAM/disk representation) with a vocabulary that allows a human to read, specify, and understand information with ease. We have existing models like RDF ("Semantic web") and property graphs (e.g. Neo4j), and in programming languages we have object graphs (OO languages), trees (functional languages), and tables (relational DBs). None of these models seem to have arisen as "the one true answer", partially because they are all difficult to reason about when operated on programmatically (or so I claim). I want a model for information that allows us to easily understand both static information structures (snapshots) and programmatically-maintained information structures (an evolving, stateful system).</p>
<p>The ideal model for information might define concepts like "pointing" (edges) or "nesting" (groups), and each concept will have a clear meaning. The ideal model will also have a semantics for mutation, e.g. you will know when you define a relationship like <code>A points to B</code> whether <code>B</code> can be deleted or modified in some way, and how this affects the <code>points to</code> connection. The model will also have a notion of stewardship of information, i.e. it should be easy to observe the source of a piece of information, and to know whether it is mutable or just a snapshot. (Yes, I believe the ideal model for information should have a vocabulary to describe distribution and trust).</p>
<p>Has anyone here thought hard about this? I've been churning on it for a month or two recently, and for many months over the last few years; I can't proceed with my own PL project until I get fundamentals like this right, since the model that I develop will fundamentally determine what a "program" even is. I think a key reason why discovering "the future of programming" is so hard is that we think too much about code and not enough about information. Code exists purely to transform information, and if you don't make strides on models for information then I don't think you can make strides on programming languages.</p>
<p>I have some ideas about a model, but I have no insights from others to validate it against. My conception is a very specific hybrid of mutable graphs and immutable trees nested sets that distinguishes between descriptions and references, and it seems very amenable to compact 2D representations, unlike most graphs. I won't describe it further just yet, since I don't want to skew anyone's responses.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd love to hear from other people who have been thinking about this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>"Tool for thought" and "augmentation of human intelligence" has a rather vase meaning, obviously. Programming environments <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/"></a><a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">https://gtoolkit.com/</a> be tools for thought, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad</a> design tools, writing tools and more [0]. But I worry that most people who are starting to get introduced to the term, only see a narrow manifestation of it in the form of Personal Knowledge Management systems. This could further obfuscate the wonderful but nebulous "tool for thought" idea, and make it even less accessible than it already is.</p>
<p>This feels similar to the semantic change of the term "Object Oriented Programming" that was initially about <a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"></a><a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html</a>, but since most people's introduction to it was through C++/Java, it lost its original meaning and became about objects, making the original idea behind OOP even more obscure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSoftware is deeply woven into contemporary life‚Äîeconomically, culturally, creatively, politically‚Äîin manners both obvious and nearly invisible. Yet while much is written about how software is used, and the activities that it supports and shapes, thinking about software itself has remained largely technical for much of its history. Increasingly, however, artists, scientists, engineers, hackers, designers, and scholars in the humanities and social sciences are finding that for the questions they face, and the things they need to build, an expanded understanding of software is necessary. For such understanding they can call upon a strand of texts in the history of computing and new media, they can take part in the rich implicit culture of software, and they also can take part in the development of an ‚Äúemerging, fundamentally transdisciplinary, computational literacy. These provide the foundation for software studies.‚Äù</p>

But I recently learned of this little library called hyperapp. Its source code is only a couple hundred lines long and is very straightforward compared to React, and in my case patching in the reflection capabilities I needed was simple(just one line of code).</p>
<p>If you're interested in prototyping new ways to build interfaces that rely on the React model it seems like a good starting point:</p>

What creates incentives for that?"</p>
<p>errr... pay developers to use a remix-friendly style?</p>
<p>Open standards and open source are approaches that (at least to a greater extent than proprietary products) are remix-friendly. Beyond that, we need people to work on platforms designed from the ground up for 'remixing'. But rarely is any private company willing to pay for that sort of thing. The idea I've always had in mind is government funding for "open engineering", the same way science is funded, except that the work products would be FOSS instead of PDFs.</p>
<p>To make sure the work products are labors of love ... people working on them should be underpaid, but on the other hand the barrier to entry should be as low as the pay scale. I'd sign up immediately.</p>

I was hoping my similar title "mastering sed: part 1" would get the same hacker news attention as "mastering jq: part 1", but alas, it didn't even get a single upvote (unlike mastering jq which got 205). It's probably that people are less interested in sed, an old cryptic unix text manipulator vs jq which is a new json, easy to use json manipulator, but I'm still surprised it got none, I expected maybe a few. In any case, I still think sed is important, so I want to keep writing about it. One other thing on my mind is the emotion in my writing. I like to write brief and to the point, no need to fluff up content with empassioned speach or frivilous information, and I appreciate brevity in other writing, but maybe that turns off my target audience?

(Go with me here ‚Äî resist the urge to treat this as a multidimensional space.)</p>
<p>In the center, we have projects that resemble typical programming languages. These tools are designed with particular semantics that the programmer will employ to structure their problem solving. They are general purpose. They don't have much regard for the particular kinds of problems being solved. This is your Java, Clojure, Vulkan, brainfuck, etc.</p>
<p>Off to one side, you have programming tools that have both tightly defined semantics and a focus on solving particular kinds of problems. These are specialized. This is Excel, Notion, Max/MSP, OpenGL, bash, etc.</p>
<p>Off to the other side, we have programming tools that, while they still have semantics, don't expect you to work entirely within those semantics. They have even less regard for the problem domain. These are tools that expect you to first build some new tools from or within them, then solve your problem with those tools. This is Racket, and arguably REST, RDF, stored procedures in a DB, and other things.</p>
<p>Now my question: are you building an FoC project that falls into the latter category? If so, talk about that a bit. What's the rationale?</p>

<ul><li>The syntax is switchable (plug in a parser you want), syntax conversions are plausible, and multiple syntaxes can be used in a single proram</li><li>The semantics are customizable (e.g. the concept of a "function call" is broken down into parts that can be customized) and multiple semantics can be combined in a single program...</li><li>The language is designed to support and encourage "parameterized" libraries, whose exact behavior and interface can be customized by a user of the library (e.g. libraries that let you select between different kinds of floating-point math after-the-fact, instead of hard-coding <code>float</code> or <code>double</code>)</li><li>The standard library is designed to evolve over time by supporting "skinnable" types. A simple example would be that in version 1.0 we have <code>Array.shift</code> and <code>Array.unshift</code> , but in a later version we decide those were terrible names and change them to <code>Array.popFirst</code> and <code>Array.pushFirst</code> <ul><li>but old code can use the old names by continuing to import the older "skin" of the <code>Array</code> type.</li></ul></li><li>Advanced metaprogramming including compile-time code execution is supported</li></ul><p>I want a language that takes the best ideas around and combines them with my own ideas ... an ultimate language. The really key part, which is maybe the hardest thing to get right, is to set it up so that some of the best features of the language can be designed and built by other people, because the foundation is good enough to make this possible.</p>

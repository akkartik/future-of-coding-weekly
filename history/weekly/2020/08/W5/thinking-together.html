He designed APL as an unambigous, expressive mathematical notation, for teaching math to undergrads, and for his personal use solving research problems and writing books and research papers. Iverson joined IBM as a mathematician, where he used his notation to formalize and specify the instruction sets of the 7090 and 360 computers. Only after that, the project at IBM to implement APL as a programming language.</p>
<p>APL doesn't usually get much credit for its influence on modern programming systems (although Mathematica, NumPy and TensorFlow are APL dialects), and it isn't usually credited as an early functional language, even though it was the first such language (to my knowledge) to have map/reduce primitives (although under different names). APL now seems to be remembered for its syntax.</p>
<p>Finally, my point. Re: Sussman, APL is a much better mathematical notation than Scheme.</p>

The function names in Numerical Python (as NumPy was originally called) are the names of APL operators. Later on, there was a movement to make NumPy more Matlab-like to win over Matlab users, so the APL heritage is no longer as clear as it used to be.</p>
<p>As for APL vs. Scheme: that really depends on what aspect of mathematical notation you focus. Sussman comes from a symbolic computation background, with an application focus on calculus (check his "Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics" as the prime example). APL has a focus on numerics and algebra. The only decent attempt I know to unify both perspectives is Mathematica.</p>

It was the language in which I was taught a range of numerical methods by one of my favorite professors (here's his <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10007880"></a><a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10007880">http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10007880</a> to the N-Queens problem), and I agree completely that it is under-appreciated for its place in CS history. However, I find the syntax leaves a good deal to be desired for work outside of its original niche, whereas the vector nature it embodies can quite naturally be expressed in any other functional programming language. It is for this reason that I prefer "APL-as-library", "PROLOG-as-library", &amp;c.</p>
<p>Regarding the history of Mathematica, it was inspired almost entirely by Wolfram's extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma</a> and written in C rather than Lisp only because <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/"></a><a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/">https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/</a> that C was "the language of the future" while they were both at Caltech. Wolfram was aware of APL, but to call Mathematica an APL dialect is in no sense correct.</p>
<p>Re: APL v Scheme as notation, I will say first that we disagree and second that even though we've only (virtually) known each other for a few weeks, your habit of expressing your subjective aesthetic opinions about Lisp family languages as if they were objective truths is already quite tiresome.</p>

<p>My thesis is that you gain a deeper understanding by building your own model up from scratch. I learn far more by building from scratch than I do from just "playing with parameters."</p>
<p>That being said, reproducibility is an important goal in itself. I applaud any efforts to improve that area!</p>

Learning is attaching new knowledge to an ever-growing edifice of solidly acquired knowledge. Reproducibility is about the solidity of that edifice. You have to be able to question your old knowledge and check if it is as solid as you thought it was, in the light of new knowledge. And that is true as much at the individual level (what we usually call "learning") as at the collective level (research, which is learning at the level of society).</p>

And in fact it is the idea from Seymour Papert with the idea of microworld. Creating microworlds helps understanding some concepts. In the case of LOGO programming the turtle helps children feel (if not understand) concepts like angles.</p>
<p>And I am convinced that this implementing-microworld idea can extend to adults to help them understand better some science, even without great programming knowledge. And as fan of visual programming, I think tools like Scracth are perfect for this: you can implement dynamic/interactive visualisation or microworld to help you grasp some concept.</p>
<p>One example. During a two days workshop where I was teaching Scratch to some teachers (middle school), one wanted to use Scratch to create a small interactive animation to explain some plate tectonics concept. She has never used programming before, but at the end of the workshop she was able to ask her students to implement this concept with Scratch.</p>

<p>There is the denotative, dictionary definition of "reproducibility": The ability "reproduce" something (note, this is generic, it can be anything, not just a research paper); to build a copy or simulacrum that exhibits the same behavior or results as the original.</p>
<p>From what I see in the thread, we all basically agree that this is a good and useful thing, particularly for learning and understanding.</p>
<p>But there is a connotative definition of "reproducibility" often associated with scientific research. This definition has more specific context associated with it. In this sense, "reproducibility" is the ability to make a copy or simulacrum that exhibits the same behavior or results of a research paper specifically for the purpose of peer review and validation.</p>
<p>This definition often implies that the reproduction should be created completely independently from original result using only the information found in the paper (and associated references and domain knowledge), but no contact with the original authors.</p>
<p>This second definition is what I believe <a href="https://emmanueloga.com/">Emmanuel Oga</a> was referring to, based on the context of his post and associated links. My response to that post was an attempt to separate the two concepts. I think I did a bad job initially, and hopefully this is more clear.</p>

<p>One initiative worth mentioning in this context is <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/"></a><a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">https://reproducible-builds.org/</a>. It's about making (Linux) executables reproducible from source code, so that you can be sure you are actually running the program whose source code you are reading. It's an answer to Ken Thompsons Turing Award speech "Reflections on trusting trust" (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf"></a><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf</a>).</p>

The idea is that papers should come with their artifacts: a "one click" implementation that process some provided example inputs and produces some example outputs, as described in the paper.</p>
<p>This is maybe independent of the conversation of whether the learner should build their own version from scratch or not (personally I do think "building from scratch" is the best way to learn). Even when building from scratch, comparing against a reference implementation is incredible useful as a learning tool.</p>

There is often a tension between being efficient and discoverable. Imagine you wanted values in a spreadsheet to be draggable and discoverable. If you show some UI you've probably just decreased the information density by 50% or more. People that are actually trying to enter data will probably tab, type, tab, type, tab, type so the UI is just wasted. Holding alt and dragging to slide a value when you want to explore is a reasonable trade off. Sure, a new user won't know they can alt-drag a value but the training of that new user is over in 30 seconds and is possibly not worth the loss in efficiency for the few days later when they start trying to be productive.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't have visible sliders period. It's rather, probably more of what's your expected use case. If you only ever expect less than say 20 inputs  then sliders might be great but if you expect 300 inputs maybe not so much? Or maybe at least there's a tension between targeting noobs and once in a while users and targeting experts/pros. There's a reason we take the training wheels off the bike at some point.</p>

Is it the entire program? As a conjunction of clauses? I guess the destructivity doesn't manifest in such a case because you're producing a "new program" (term) which you guarantee is going to be strictly larger than the last one (adding new deductions). That suggests term rewriting might be "too powerful" for logic programming though, because it can also model the deletion of facts (unless you want that capability, for some reason).</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm now seeing how you could map inference to term rewriting!</p>

When logic shows up in the foundations of computing, it's usually in the context of the Curry-Howard isomorphism. From that perspective, logical inference is sort of... program synthesis, I think? More broadly, finding elements that occupy a type that represents a proposition.</p>
<p>It could be that logical inference is (IIUC) inherently search-oriented, so people who make "models of computation" don't see it as a good primitive operation: too many steps and decisions behind the scenes. If that's the case, I think there's still some good mileage to be had from making a model where logical inference is stupid easy to write and tractable for an optimizer as well. (Uncoincidentally, this is an approach I'd like to do, but I don't know enough yet)</p>

Given that typing speed is completely irrelevant to productivity for everyone except perhaps professional writers, I‚Äôve never tried any weird keyboards since.

<p>I also recently tried an ergodox EZ, but the layout of keys was again quite a high effort to learn (and I found it awkward that many of the symbol keys I expected to find on the right, or beside the Z were not there).  Lots of folks make up their own keyboard layouts for it (but I imagine this is easier if you aren't a touch typist to start with): <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"></a><a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">https://ergodox-ez.com/</a></p>
<p>I have a Mattias half keyboard too: <a href="http://matias.ca/halfkeyboard/"></a><a href="http://matias.ca/halfkeyboard/">http://matias.ca/halfkeyboard/</a>  This is a weird one; your brain really does fill in the gap and let you type with one hand, 'mirroring' the other half.  I've found it occasionally useful for use during CAD tools, but its more of a novelty than something I would seriously use all day (unless I didn't have the use of one hand).</p>
<p>Finally, I tried a Kinesis FreeStyle Edge:</p>
<p><a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/"></a><a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/">https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/</a></p>
<p>This was OK, but eventually I had to admit to myself that my typing speed was significantly slower using Cherry/Mechanical keys; it just takes so much more effort to press them than the short travel of the MS Sculpt.  I was also finding my hands were far more tired by the end of the day.  I haven't measured my output, but I type a lot during a given day.  One of the reasons I'm really interested in input devices!</p>
<p>My dream keyboard is the MS Sculpt, separated into 2 halves that I can spread apart on the desk....  I believe I am on my 6th Sculpt.  I probably kill one in less than a year.</p>

Getting used to ortholinear QWERTY wasn't too bad (except for learning to strike <code>B</code> with my left hand).</p>
<p>The rearrangement of modified keys has made writing code pretty slow; brackets/braces have been muscle memory for me for so long (and I have a habit of typing the opening bracket, then the closing bracket, and then the back arrow to fill the contents), but both brackets/braces and the arrow keys are displaced.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I prefer the split keyboard for typing text, even though I'm somewhat slower, because the improved posture is good. I do not prefer it for writing code.</p>

Have tried Dvorak before but couldn't switch and I like Workman better now. A couple of differences are: (1) taxing the middle column (and better priorities overall), so hands rarely move sideways, less pinky load, (2) less emphasis on hand alternation and more "rolling" combos (e.g., t/h, s/t, d/r are next to each other, so it feels nice and easy typing them).</p>
<p>I also use Vim-like keybindings and they work surprisingly well. The only one remapping I do is swap j and k (because j is on the top row but means "down," and k is on bottom row but means "up"‚Äîcouldn't make my mind adjust to that). Other than that, Vim bindings on Workman work great. As a bonus, you learn to use hjkl less and rely on better movement commands more.</p>
<p>As a downside, when I have to type on other people's keyboards, that's awful. I have to look at the keys or I type trash otherwise.</p>

I recommended the character point in the direction where she wants the text to appear in the world, wiggle her finger as though swiping on a phone (yes, QWERTY style), and mumble what it is that she means to write (for the audience).  We could imagine subvocalizations as well.  Moral being that the noisy signals (subvocalizations and finger wiggles) get fused by the dictation software.  Just a thought.</p>

<p>because I started to notice RSI symptoms in my right pinky and realized how much of the keyboard it normally controls.</p>
<p>I've also remapped tapping caps lock to be escape and holding it to be ctrl, both very useful for vim.</p>
<p>(Another change I made recently was to entirely remap vim, e.g. making the equivalent of IJKL act as arrow keys instead of HJKL).</p>
<p>I'm on a normal keyboard atm (Microsoft Sidewinder X4), but I've been planning to make my own split ergo keyboard for a while, maybe the Dactyl (pictured)...</p>

It seems these topics are more deeply intertwined than I had previously realised.</p>
<ul><li>The field of logic emerged as a means of studying how humans reason using natural language. Logic is irrevocably tied to the structure of natural language, and therefore it seems foolish to try to add natural language to a programming system without basing it on logic.</li><li>Ontology is the study of categories and relationships. Ontology languages like OWL are actually based on Description Logic (I was surprised!), which could be perceived as a type system based on first-order logic. This gives us a formal way of conceptualising entities and have the computer check that a program is going to respect that conceptualisation.I had been dissuaded from reading into the use of ontologies in information systems because most resources I encountered about it are about the "Semantic Web"; I had equated the two. I'm interested merely in programming systems, and accordingly I have no interest in trying to make or support global standards for the categorisation of information. But the fundamental idea of ontology is sound: it seems like a bridge between natural language, logic, and type systems. I'd be a fool to ignore it given I'm designing a logic programming system.</li></ul><p>Next up: Several weeks studying the interplay between logic, natural language, ontologies, and type systems!</p>

<p>The whole OOP/functional debate, this talk, and frankly a lot of my thinking seem to principally be about modelling logic, and striving to get to some place where state is abstracted away. I/we seem to want to get to a world where I/we think mostly about computation and not about state change over time. I had a very strange experience switching from working on a backend team where state is the devil and ruins performance of everything (it'd be so fast if it didn't store anything!) to working in analytics where data is everything and where the code is a tiny little ever-changing bit of glue that manipulates this massive, permanent, far more important artifact. I found it nasty. It's nasty because the data captures every mistake ever made, which pile up and force every user to care about until fixed. It's nasty because it's big and hard to make development responsive. It's nasty because it feels wrong to write "poor" code you run once to fix something then delete, and it is really hard to get a handle on the shape, or quality, or meaning of real big datasets.</p>
<p>I think I had (have) data-phobia, and it took getting immersed in a data-heavy product to realize that I think I/we have it backwards, and that the data is more important than the instructions for manipulating it, and deserves to be the focus, not the nagging feeling at the back of your head. What I was struck with in Rich's talk is that the epochal time model and FP writ large seem like they are born of the same phobia, trying to escape the shackles of state management in order to get back to some pure world of computation that doesn't actually exist. A bunch of Bret Victor's work circles around this too, where the instructions to run the code are way less emphasized than the (often visual) data created by what the instructions are actually doing. All the hover-to-see-the-value or watch-this-expression debugging tools are us being forced to go back from pure computation to look at the actual data flowing through once more. Airtable/spreadsheets are counter examples of non-data-phobic tools that seem to be easier to use, maybe because they put the data first.</p>
<p>So ... am I off my rocker? Is data-phobia a real thing, a force that has shaped our tools to demote a super important piece of our lives? Is there an antidote?</p>

<p>At the highest level, computing is always about that big mass of data that is sitting on your computer's disk. All that stuff that accumulated over time as the result of lots of computations and equally many user interactions. There is no way around this fact. That mass of data is the reason why we use computers at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that mass of data is also what we mess up all the time, so we have been looking for ways to do data updates in some principled way. In the end, that's what both OO and FP are about. OO divides the state into compartments so that we can look at small pieces at a time. FP focuses on data transformations, which it divides into compartments so that we can better reason about them.</p>

An example of the former in the small is that is your code will be easier for everyone, including you, to understand if it's made of functions that take inputs and outputs rather than ones that change a shared scratch pad. The latter is why Datomic keeps all previous versions of what's been written to it and treats a handle to a database as pertaining to a snapshot at a particular moment in time.</p>

They use different mediums, but how do these mediums affect the representations? How do we determine equivalence? What can be directly represented in the medium vs what needs to be simulated (e.g. Objects can represent "identity", or you can simulate it via 'ids' in a system that doesn't have them. "Time" is built-in to some models, but may be simulated via version_ids, etags etc.).</p>

I wonder if there's a better way to communicate that perspective. ü§î</p>
<p>Some of the problems here are a consequence of the kind of universe in which we happen to live: there's no central clock and all observations are local to the observer. Lambda calculus is a great way to model computation, but it is serial and operates within a single frame of reference. When we want to compute with multiple observers, which we very often do in a networked/multicore world, additional theory is needed to make things sensible.</p>
<p>Most approaches one encounters at the end of that road start to look more like biology, where there are -- using the terms in quotes because they're familiar, though not exactly correct -- "objects" with local "threads" that communicate via "messages". This can look like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</a>, <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215"></a><a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215">https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Œ†-calculus"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Œ†-calculus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Œ†-calculus</a>, or any number of other things, but they all share the idea that we're performing dataflow between "processors". (N.B. Nodes in a dataflow system can be thought of as lazy functions from inputs to outputs, possibly with local state, called incrementally by whatever execution engine is at work.)</p>

Rich also once noted that prog lang and database designers are rarely the same people. Any major programming language has next to no definition of real-world-state, meaning that beyond mutable variables and data-structures ideas about persistence, querying data etc are missing. Arguably every programming language transforms data but it rarely has a rich idea of where this data comes from and where it will go? Real-world information is an afterthought for all major programming languages and if we buy into the medium being the message notion then the medium, code, only ever transforms some data that we usually can't see, because it's maybe to big to see or it's in format that we can't (usually) see in our tools (images, video, animation). Beyond that code is static. It transforms data but data can not be seen being transformed so again the tool, the language carries an implicit motivator for the programmer to write transformation code, not visualizations or comprehension tools.</p>

<p>Although we colloquially divide state from the algorithm that specifies transformations of that state, the algorithm itself exists as state encoded in the registers, stack, instruction pointer, and so on. Sometimes we modify the behavior of the system by having the algorithm change its own code while running. Okay, code is also data.</p>
<p>If we implement the naive B-tree algorithm, the shape (and thus performance) of the constructed B-tree depends entirely on the entropy present in the sequence of keys we insert into it. In this situation the B-Tree compiles a tiny state machine from the "code" of the input keys. Okay, data is also code.</p>

If it helps, some of the specific terms of art for making the thing in itself are: meta-circularity (which is where a compiler is written in the language it compiles, like ClojureScript and gcc) and bootstrapping (which is, IIRC, where an interactive system is implemented entirely using things that can be edited from within that system at runtime, like some Smalltalk implementations). I'm going to assume you're referring to that sort of thing, perhaps in a slightly broader sense, which in my mind would include Jupyter being used to edit the same language it's implemented in.</p>
<p>As for how important it is ‚Äî I would say it depends on what the goals of the environment are. It's a tradeoff.</p>
<p>Without knowing for sure what sense of "interfaces" you mean (GUIs? FFIs?), there are plenty of good reasons to do it, like the one mentioned in the tweet, or like wanting to prove that the system you're building is expressive enough to express itself (eg: if Jupyter could only handle ASCII, that would be a lack of expressive power needed to be a general JavaScript editor). On the other hand, there are a ton of reasons not to do it ‚Äî perf, often being the #1 cited reason I've seen, but also simplicity, in that you might not want to spend the effort to make your environment so expressive that it can express itself.</p>

<p>Realizing that not every language/ecosystem aspires/has good ergonomics for used for  GUI/editor toolmaking makes me think that if someone wanted to change the Jupyter situation, it may be more efficient trying to get JS devs curious about plugin-making then modifying Jupyter so that plugins could be written using the science scripting languages eg Python/Julia/R. </p>

The biggest failing of projects like Atom and VSCode is that although they run inside a live environment they do not provide a REPL that allows code execution in the context of the editor itself. This makes plugin development a static compile-test-run sort of affair rather than an interactive "build up from small pieces" experience.</p>

Is self-bootstrapping important? Is the software at hand supposed to be a concrete product providing a reliable experience, or is it a fluid process for experimenting toward experiences we haven't imagined yet? In "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet", Alan Kay talked about Squeak as a tool to help you build the next version of itself. In contrast, he says that commercial Smalltalk didn't change much once it was released. It's difficult to build software products with a moving foundation. I think there's a fundamental tension between (r)evolutionary software-as-process and commercial software-as-product. The balance between progress and stability is tough to strike.</p>
<p>On a different note, one thing I like about self-bootstrapping systems is the conceptual unity. Once you "get it", you get a LOT. That's one reason I too jumped to VSCode--writing plugins using the same tech those plugins are supposed to work with reduced cognitive load. But then I got annoyed with VSCode because of the compile-test-run cycle. VSCode is a product, not a process. There is an essential staticness to it. You can't tinker with it to create something fundamentally other than what it is.</p>
<p>That's why I started experimenting with a self-bootstrapping JS editor. Ideally, application development and editor live-tinkering should be the same fundamental process. Ideally, I think end-user development abstractions should be built directly on top of developer constructs (e.g., hadron.app). I think self-bootstrapping, if taken to its limit, offers the chance to build a deep ubiquitous language for communication between users and developers in building pliable software.</p>

<p>Personally, I find tools that I can adapt myself much more empowering, and for reaching that goal it helps a lot to have a single medium. But such tools are rare, most people have never experienced one, and so they are not asking for it.</p>

While it's easy for me to imagine a new (especially more graphically capable) environment built around some language I like more than elisp, such a thing would absolutely need to be "emacsy" in this sense.</p>

What worked well? Did later iterations/inspired projects tweak this approach? How (if at all) can lazy vs eager reactivity be managed using this approach?</p>

<p>This is pretty interesting. Does anyone here have any experience with godot for gui dev? I wonder if you could ship your stuff fully instrumented in a way to allow the user themselves to edit it on the fly. Moving towards more integrated graphics stuff seems to be in the future of gui stuff, the web is already that in a sense.</p>

<p>Godot for GUI apps I suspect is one of those things where it looks 99% there but they really have 10x more work to do to actually be ready to handle full internationalization (Thai, Korean, Arabic, Chinese, emoji, ...) but if you stick to latin based languages it works.</p>

<p>“But while programming languages are academically interesting, I think we more desperately need innovation in programming environments.</p>
<p>The programming environment isn’t a single component of our workflow, but the total sum enabled by the tools working together harmoniously. The environment contains the programming language, but also includes the debugging experience, dependency management, how we communicate with other developers (both within source code and without), how we trace and observe code in production, and everything else in the process of designing APIs to recovering from failure.</p>
<p>The story of programming language evolution is also a story of rising ideas in what capabilities good programming environments should grant developers. Many languages came to popularity not necessarily based on their merits as great languages, but because they were paired with some new and powerful capability to understand software and write better implementations of it.”</p>

Imagine a programming environment that just worked: no configuration, no environment variables, no editor plugins, no "escaping to the shell" to type extraneous commands, no PATH conflicts, no dependency hell, no skimming the backtrace to find the originating source of the error... etc. etc. just a quick install tool that worked 100% the same in each platform. Push one button, get a binary for any platform. Users could download the zip/binary, double click and have the thing running. There's no current platform that is as easy to work with as I describe.</p>

<p>Don’t read this for the application “Gatemaker”. Read this for a fascinating outsider’s view on the software industry, systems design, and end-user programming.</p>
<p>Here are a few excerpts to whet your appetite (and/or get you upset enough) to embrace the rather long read (highlights mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The focus of the subsequent Software Patterns movement remained within the formal sciences, and so could not interpret CA’s work in the natural and human sciences: the application of human judgment using feeling, the smooth unfolding of natural geometry, and the task of helping people (programmers or users) to become more whole and alive. The criteria for ‘good’ were so different, that everything was misconstrued, from ‘pattern’ to ‘incremental’. Again, they aren’t to blame: &gt; this focus on abstraction, and the dismissal of feeling, and the reality beyond constructed formal systems, is endemic in the computer industry.&gt;  Today, Software Patterns proponents, like most successful computer people, are not even interested in this cavernous disparity.</p>
<p>Interchangeable parts make an adaptive natural structure impossible. Programming environments, including those inspired by patterns, push this ‘parts’ view, which hampers sensitivity and true novelty. &gt; It’s the worldview of the factory-builder, and these tools for mass-production logistics have little regard for people.&gt; </p>
<p>When underlying code is considered different, and more important, the tendency is simply to trash hard-won efforts to improve the user’s experience.&gt;  This happens all the time in the industry, and Google is among those pushing the lunatic idea that we may not need people to create user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a complete divergence from CA’s work, where the underlying structure is in harmony with human interaction. Computing is not ‘somehow different’. It is still a human tool recruited for human purposes, and the principles still apply.</p>
<blockquote><p>But it was hard to get computing folk to focus on the actual human effect of the program. In fact, they saw it, experienced it, momentarily agreed that it was surprising, but soon forgot it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, they simply weren’t equipped to discuss what we’d accomplished. They were not natural scientists, nor activists. &gt; They shared ‘pragmatic’ and fashionable industry viewpoints that make it nearly impossible for anyone to discover anything new or important about people &amp; computers</p>
<blockquote><p>The software patterns literature has no such research initiative. Instead, they focus on objects, properties, types, lists, titles and categories. &gt; It looks like butterfly collecting, with no drive to build a theory with explanatory adequacy. It’s Natural History instead of Natural Science.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fractals are such a poor idealization of the real world.</p>
<p>In nature, factors and interrelationships typically change at different scales. You can’t find a Mandelbrot set in nature. L-Systems cannot be considered first-order approximations of trees. They tell us more about our perception than about trees.</p>

<p>The passage that leaps out at me is:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the overall design principles that emerged, in complete contrast with most computing: “don't let the computer leap to conclusions” and change the screen. We grew increasingly skeptical of any automatic behavior, any perceptible ‘leap' taken by the software, because it disrupted the mood necessary for harmonious work. The screen should be super stable, comfortable, reliable and quiet. It shouldn't even seem to be there. Even word processors don't have this level of gentle stability. We didn't even let the application window change size, because this seriously changes the geometry of the work. The fact that this does effect people should give pause to designers of showy, kinetic, “entertaining”, and distracting, user interfaces.</p>

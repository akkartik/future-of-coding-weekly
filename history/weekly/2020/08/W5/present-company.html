The workspaces are synchronized to be used synchronously or asynchronously with your teams. Hope you can get a chance to try it with them! you can organize your meetings before they happen and recurrent meetings are a bliss since the documents are always there. </p>

I suspect you probably already did some react already? The gist of mvvm is to manually build a graph of dependencies, and when you change the data from code, it should directly modify the DOM attached to some end of the graph you are creating. Changes are "bidirectional": when you change the data, it changes the DOM, and when you change the DOM, it changes the (JS) data.</p>

The state, however, can be implemented however you choose.</p>
<p>You could totally implement MVVM using React as the view layer. My personal setup involves some observable models in which React components listen for changes and re-render in such event - which doesn't seem too far removed from MVVM in my head at least.</p>

The View is the Vue.js template, and the ViewModel is the Vue.js data.</p>
<p>React is not MVVM by default but I guess you can do MVVM with it, as Ryan said.</p>

It uses XAML for the template part. But maybe your know it and that is why you first ask?</p>
<p>In fact I discovered MVVM with a project where WPF was chosen. And I fall in love with the MVVM concept at that time. I then tried Knockout.js, and then stick to Vue.js.</p>

<p>The snapping being an extension to/equivalent to dragging seems promising from a UX perspective, particularly if it can be made clear after the fact what 'type' of drag created it.</p>
<p>-&gt; is there an exhaustive list of the type of snaps? e.g translate, scale, rotate... if it's a small list then there maybe some scope for replacing the circular nodes with appropriate icons (or adding icons somewhere...)</p>
<p>spreads seems like an intuitive approach to one of the CS fundamentals - repetition</p>
<p>conditionals seem more abstract, and I'm not sure to what extent you can represent them, particularly if the other visual variables (colour, opacity, texture, position...) are all reserved for the user... I imagine they'd probably need a separate view, either for abstract conditionals in general or looking at a particular group (however that's defined), and showing all the potential alternatives</p>

I have a feeling these principles could also work as an IDE extension (imagine being able to hide the "code" layer and show only the "comments" layer, or the "documentation" layer). Curious to hear your thoughts, or whether anyone else is working on something similar?</p>

Lots of our designs have trickled out over the last decade, but sadly that one hasn‚Äôt yet. We did all sorts of cool stuff with it, turned types on and off, reduced things to signatures, embedded profiling information in, unit testing coverage/passing, git blame-like stuff, callers/references, even real-time inline diffing, all toggled by this little series of buttons attached to the top right of the screen. The design came from thinking of the editor a bit like an overhead projector and you just kept putting transparencies over top whatever was there - different sets gave you very different views on the thing you were looking at. That same idea eventually was the source for the name ‚ÄúLight Table.‚Äù</p>
<p>Years later I was surprised to see Gary Berhardt basically produce the same design, with many of the same examples! üôÇ <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world"></a><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world</a></p>

In the video, the style is just a color. The style could be a little fancier ‚Äî maybe different fonts, why not. But the process of defining a new layer ought to be just like photoshop: add a layer on the fly, name it (or not), put stuff in it. The barrier being so low, you don't even acknowledge how powerful it is.</p>
<p>Sure, we could start imagining all the built-in layers a code editor could add, and that's cool... but that's a different thing than a tool just for a writer to define their own conventions around. Like the difference between adjustment layers (PS) or nondestructive filter layers (Pixelmator Pro) and regular layers (every nontrivial image, video, music, etc editor).</p>
<p>I want both, but they're separate ideas.</p>

My current workflow for writing fiction sort of emulates this in plain text: I often put an outline thingy (list of beats, anyway) at the start of a scene and delete them later. I also tend to mark things for future deletion with square brackets if I'm not sure yet whether I want to (or to give me time to cope with killing a favorite line). I would love to instead shunt them to a different layer. I crave layers every day, and so I've thought a lot about them, for outlining as in your demo, for coding as in Bernhardt's talk, and for data representation like <a href="https://twitter.com/NickSmit_">Nick Smith</a>  and <strong>@Orion Reed</strong> have been talking about, e.g. if you're extracting and transforming data from a word doc, using layers as a way to separate info that is portable between formats and Word-proprietary details that just need to stay around if we want to round-trip processed data into the original format.</p>
<p>So yes, I've been working on it in the sense of thinking and wishing really hard. Still working out the details.</p>

I use org-mode in Emacs in much the same way, but it's a lot more cumbersome to use because org-mode, like all outline/folding editors, supposes a hierarchy of detail which isn't always there.

That's a very nice implementation of detail-hiding, but not the same as unrelated layers.</p>

I'm surprised more editors don't automatically format and let you edit markdown tags live inside documents; it feels like a natural extension that should have been done a while ago.  The layers in the demo are more like 'folds', yes?  i.e. the layers aren't independent of the text paragraphs on other layers - they are stacked with them?  It's powerful stuff.

<ul><li>I'm not sure whether I want to say "John while Henry had had had had had..." or "Sarah while Kim had had had..." here, so I'll put the latter on a different layer here so I can come back and switch it later if I change my mind.</li><li>I'm going to put all copy-pasted quotes on a different layer, and URLs to sources on their own layer too, so I can be sure to catch them all when I do biblio at the end.</li><li>I want to write a parenthetical in this parenthetical, but that's going to be awful for readability. I'll throw it on a new layer, so I can catch it when I come back for rewrites.</li><li>I hate this sentence. I don't think it needs to be here.

This opens up a whole new dimension. Kinda like transclusion, but simpler, because the content isn't "somewhere else, transcluded here" but rather "in another layer, but right here". There is an implicit, global organization (the flattened document), but then you can expand the flatness into the different dimensions as needed.</p>

I like to take different kinds of notes--structural, commentary, cross-reference (within a work/to other works), summary, etc. I've been thinking about building something around an e-book reader that would allow me to move between and freely intersperse different forms of notes.</p>
<p>So, I could start with a view of my structural notes (my "map" of the book; possibly involving visualizations) and quickly drill down to the right section for deeper reading. Then I could add a cross reference by searching through my corpus for the right information, then pull it up side-by-side and add shared commentary--which can then serve as a new work that I can then structure, commentate, cross-reference, and so on.</p>
<p>It's a view of writing (or note-taking) that emphasizes the connection between the stimulus (the original work) and the response (the layers of annotation), always keeping them linked. So, theoretically, if I published a blog post and a reader owned a book I reference in the post, they'd be able to move directly from a reference in the post to the relevant passage in the book, then be able to surf my layers of annotation (and add their own) if they so desire.</p>
<p>Haven't gotten around to doing anything yet, though.</p>

Seems very similar to me except that children are inlined when visible. When nesting, for example:</p>
<pre><code>- 1

  - 2

    - 3



- 1

  - 2

    - 3

      - 4</code></pre><p>the user would need a shortcut or UI to choose a global depth (level) which would open all nodes until a certain depth (1,2 or 3, 4).</p>
<p>I think either approach (flat &amp; nested) possible in roam today by using tags &amp; filters. So the user would have to tag a block like <code>#ideas</code> and the apply the appropriate filter.</p>

Beyond that, the difference is entirely in the UI. Nesting mixes content and presentation, layers (as imagined in this thread) don't. What seems nice about nesting is that it's easy to move things between layers ‚Äî just indent/outdent to the level you want.</p>

The individually showable/hideable segments in an org-mode style outline are confined to mutually exclusive regions (wrt their "level"), whereas layers can freely intermingle through the full extent of the document. To recover layers from an outline, you would need to not only have an operation that hides/shows everything at, say, level 2 without changing the parent's visibility, but you would need to have other "levels" under level 1 that actually sort of compare the same as 2, in the sense that they are always siblings, but distinct for the purposes of the global show/hide command. I'm not sure that would be enough, actually. Once you add the idea of arbitrary visibility, it's hard for me to think of it as hierarchical at all.</p>
<p>Looked at another way, nesting induces a total order on the "layers" that may not be desirable.</p>
<p>So, I would argue layers are more general than nesting. Nesting is easily implemented in terms of layers (one per node), but nesting is not enough to implement layering without at least using weird hacks.</p>

I think that's essential to being a Unix "lingua franca". To process a piece of layered text, you have to know what layers exist and what they mean. Most of them are probably very application-specific, even stream-specific. You could generically pass them through, but then an entire ecosystem of utilities has to deal with format complexity they can't benefit from and can only mess up. At that point it's probably better to build a full object system like Powershell, since you're already paying for most of it.</p>

We design PLs with a 'flat' grammar because we are designing languages represented in flat text. Layered text is still very free form and Unix like, but would lead to different kinds of PLs that make use of the layers.</p>

One thing I've been thinking about is annotating shaders with widget information.  For example, what if my flattened code looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* Layer:1 Widget:Slider, Min:0, Max:10 */ float val;</code></pre><p>Effectively showing layer 1 would enable editing of how the float value widget would work.  Hiding layer 1 just gives you the shader code with the widget popup.</p>
<p>As I understand it layers aren't nested, but I think you'd need to be able to 'expand' deeper layers into upper layers without opening intermediate layers.  For example:</p>
<p>L0:-----------|---</p>
<p>L1: ------|-------</p>
<p>L2 ----|----------</p>
<p>The | represents the location in Layer1 of layer2.  Expanding layer 1 would show layer 2, and inside layer 2 there is another point where a further layer lives.  But if L2 is shown but L1 is not, then L2 would effectively appear where the | is on layer 0.  I think?</p>
<p>And of course, edits to the L0 layer would wind up 'moving' the insertion point of Layer1.  But what about deleting the region around the expand point?  I guess the next layer just drops into the nearest sensible position.....</p>
<p>I do something similar with Markers in my code, which can be used for things like compile errors.  Which brings up the next issue of compiling code and referring back to locations in the source that may not be expanded, etc. üòâ</p>
<p>So in short, interesting issues that might lead to a powerful system......</p>

<p>Here's how it differs from most common technologies today:</p>
<ul><li>Approaches to UI development like react.js + graphQL require UI components to&nbsp;request&nbsp;data in a shape that satisfies the UI tree. This means the shape of the data is determined by the UI tree. Root takes an inverse approach where the UI tree is determined by the shape of the data.</li><li>A major benefit of this approach is that the UI layout is thus entirely determined by data, data that can be traversed, transformed and stored in arbitrary ways and by arbitrary means.</li><li>This is powerful for unstructured, user-determined, block-based UI's like rich documents (think Roam Research, Notion etc.) enabling queries and functions that, based on users' demands,&nbsp;derive&nbsp;the optimal presentation of a document.</li></ul><p>It packs a few more punches. The best example is probably this <a href="https://den1k.github.io/root/rich-document.html"></a><a href="https://den1k.github.io/root/rich-document.html">https://den1k.github.io/root/rich-document.html</a> in about 200 LoC (<a href="https://github.com/den1k/root/blob/master/dev/examples/rich_document/views.cljs"></a><a href="https://github.com/den1k/root/blob/master/dev/examples/rich_document/views.cljs">https://github.com/den1k/root/blob/master/dev/examples/rich_document/views.cljs</a>).

When you define your <code>ui-root</code> you give it a <code>lookup</code> function and <code>content-keys</code> . from there it works like reduce: you pass it a <code>root-id</code> that it passes to <code>lookup</code>. lookup returns data that root wraps in your defined UI components or the default component. It also looks for <code>content-keys</code> on <code>lookup</code>s return value, passes those to <code>lookup</code> and recurses down all the paths. Upfront root is not aware of the structure of the data. Given the id, <code>lookup</code> can run arbitrary computation. It can for example issue an http request or read from indexedDB. It can return data or a promise that root will resolve and eventually render. It‚Äôs dumb by design and that gives it lots of flexibility.</p>

<p>and root-id is just where ui-root starts that process in the data tree?</p>

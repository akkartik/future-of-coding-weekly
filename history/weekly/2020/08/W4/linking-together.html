The kind of flow state that game induces is exactly what I want programming to feel like (post requirements analysis). Factorio provides a visceral feeling of progress.

<p>It's nice if they are having fun but the idea that they got frustrated spending 30 minutes in a modeling tool and then spent 2 weeks making their own suggests mostly that in a year or two they'll realize they really should have spent the time to learn a modeling package if their goal was to model something.</p>
<p>It mean it's kind of like saying "I spent 30 minutes trying to learn guitar but it was too hard so I wrote some code to make chiptunes". Yea okay but you still don't know how to play the guitar and no amount of diddling with chiptunes is going to get you closer to being able to play that guitar.</p>
<p>PS: there are programs that make 3D modeling easier but they almost always fall short once you get serious. Like notepad is easier than vi and iMovie is easier than Final Cut Pro and MSPaint is easier than Photoshop</p>

Here's Galloway's summary (<a href="https://twitter.com/PivotSchooled/status/1293664207783759874"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/PivotSchooled/status/1293664207783759874">https://twitter.com/PivotSchooled/status/1293664207783759874</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately innovation has become more about your access to capital such that you can go buy the future versus the grit and creativity of bootstrapping something really exceptional.To support this statement from my own observations, I recently wrote about how OS X was an incredible hotbed of innovation in the early 2000s (<a href="https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/06/26/remembering-the-oreilly-mac-os-x-innovators-contest/"></a><a href="https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/06/26/remembering-the-oreilly-mac-os-x-innovators-contest/">https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/06/26/remembering-the-oreilly-mac-os-x-innovators-contest/</a>). There are a few examples there, another one that I didn't highlight but should have is VoodooPad (<a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/"></a><a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">https://www.voodoopad.com/</a>) which was the first implementation (that I'm aware of) of using a wiki for personal information management. A concept that is finally seemingly reaching a wider audience these days with Roam Research. Contrast these products, which introduced innovative concepts, and were (as far as I know) entirely bootstrapped, and generally were released, and became profitable after 1-2 years of development. Versus what I would consider an innovative product today: Something like Figma and Notion, which were founded in 2012 and 2013 respectively, each spent ~5 years before really having their breakout moments, and have raised over $200m combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is innovation primarily being primarily driven by access to capital today? If so, what's changed since the 2000s? And if not, what are some examples of success stories today where smaller, bootstrapped companies are releasing innovative products?</p>

There is a ton of innovation happening in smaller "scenes" that just isn't very legible to media outlets and these influencer types and VCs. Imo the most interesting work is often the most obscure. The frontier is not glittzy and has no press-releases, in fact often it might be deliberately staying under the radar. So I think the opinions about innovation from these established personalities should be taken in mind with the maturity of their careers, which often corresponds with how deeply embedded they are in stale systems.</p>

Their rants are always fun, and I agree with most of it. His recent demo of how Visual Studio is slower than the version from 10 years ago was telling. The statement that software which works in the morning isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work in the afternoon is frightening and so true! A feature I‚Äôm keen to build into my own software is a snapshot ability to enable retreat to any modification point. Perhaps that‚Äôs something that should happen at an OS level? Because I can‚Äôt see a day where we don‚Äôt need updates to patch vulnerabilities, if nothing else....</p>

This is decades overdue, but we are seeing progress in the Linux world. Ubuntu 20.04 has ZFS on root, with automatic snapshots when a package is upgraded. Fedora 33 (due Oct 2020) defaults to BTRFS on root, again with automatic snapshots and the ability to roll back to a previous state. NixOS has a different approach to package management, allowing individual apps to be rolled back, rather than requiring rollback to an earlier state to be a "global" operation. The flatpak app distribution system (works on all modern Linux systems) permits rollback to a previous version (which is granular on a per-app basis). What seems to be largely missing so far is a slick, high level GUI for rolling back software changes.</p>

You can not only snapshot your installed software, but even install the state from an arbitrary point back in time (though that can be slow because everything gets recompiled, starting with the compiler).</p>
<p>GUI support is indeed missing, and some important software hasn't been packaged yet. You can't install binaries made for ordinary Linux distributions either, because the file system layout is very different. So this is not ready for prime time, but it's far more than just a proof of concept.</p>

It always felt like hardware interfaces should be implemented as a blackboard system where devices push events and consume events and nothing else (similar to his ‚Äújust have ring buffers‚Äù idea). Interop is trivial at that point. Creating new devices is just pushing new events that some other system looks for. The events can be easily versioned and so on. The problem is that doing so isn‚Äôt just a ground up software rewrite, it really is a ground up hardware ecosystem reconstruction and boy is that a tall order.</p>

The claim is not exaggerated: Feynman diagrams have changed the way quantum physics is done. Think of them as a layer of abstraction on top of mathematics. Each diagram can be translated to some lengthy integral, but those integrals are much too lengthy to be manipulated in all but the simplest cases.</p>
<p>BTW, another, more accessible, case of notation being a major breakthrough is vector notation in geometry. Check out old textbooks (1930s or earlier) in mathematics or physics - you don't want to look at those equations if you grew up with vector notation.</p>

I think many people are recognizing right now, including of course the author, that GNU-style open source alone is insufficient, that it needs to be placed in and complement larger liberatory efforts.

There is a hard core in the FSF that still promotes GNU-style freedom as the ultimate road to happiness, but most people in the Open Source universe have recognized that licenses aren't the whole story.</p>
<p>My main worry about the FOSS world right now is a tendency towards tribalism in Open Source communities. For many people, their community is everything, more important even than the software it produces and the impact it has on the wider world. As an example, for many people in the scientific Python ecosystem it seems more important to promote Python than to enable good science.</p>

What I mean, is that we have few large sources of inspiration for our future as an aesthetic: the techno-determinist futures found in shiny Apple products, Elon Musk and platforms like Uber; and the reactionary futures as a response to climate change.</p>
<p>I think both of these are problematic and not actually desirable (even as I write this on an iPhone, which I do think is quite sexy)</p>
<p>I love any effort to rekindle a sense of what‚Äôs possible, especially building new and desirable aesthetics around it. and for anyone familiar with political theory this is all closely related to ideas such as ‚Äòcapitalist realism‚Äô, the ‚Äòend of history‚Äô, and ‚Äòmodernity‚Äô</p>

<p>, and with further growth the organization becomes a danger for its environment. It's the human version of the paperclip maximizer. It would be great if FOSS community leaders were aware of this mechanism and took preventive action, but so far I don't see that happen. I'd love to see codes of conduct also mentioning the community's impact on the outside world, and larger communities nominating outside observers to provide them with feedback.</p>
<p>Among the biggest damage FOSS communities can create is depletion of the global attention reservoir. Which I think is one of the issues of FoC work. Anyone doing serious work in tech nowadays has to delve so deep into Linux that it becomes hard to envisage computing without Linux.</p>

<p>This is pretty interesting. Does anyone here have any experience with godot for gui dev? I wonder if you could ship your stuff fully instrumented in a way to allow the user themselves to edit it on the fly. Moving towards more integrated graphics stuff seems to be in the future of gui stuff, the web is already that in a sense.</p>

<p>My tech stack is Emacs plus a few add-ons (org, org-roam, notmuch). I have an org-roam database for long-term notes, and two plain org files (work/personal) for short-time notes and to-dos. A crucial feature for me is that I can link from those two org files to my long-term notes, to e-mails, and to the individual files and directories in which I manage larger projects, in particular collaborative ones. Each project also has an org file for project-specific short-term notes, for the notes I share with my collaborators.</p>

<p>We probably don‚Äôt want to compile user code to hardware since we still want to be able to change code so quickly but things like the interpreter that are relatively fixed and are used by enough people maybe it makes sense. </p>
<p>Should we hardware be a more significant portion of the stack? Does the tradeoff make sense? Flexibility for power. (Just checked Wikipedia, yeah ASIC or FPGA that is just for python for example). Wonder if anyone has tried it and if it would be more widespread in future. </p>

Desktop discrete GPUs have thousands of processing units. Every personal computer (desktop, laptop, mobile) now has a powerful GPU. Machine learning has made GPUs even more relevant. The future of code needs to take GPUs into account, and not ignore this powerful hardware. My project, Curv, lets you write simple, high level code that executes either on the CPU or on the GPU. Curv is a pure functional language because it's easier to compile pure functional code into massively parallel GPU code. I think that GPUs are viable as an architecture for pure functional programming. I do think that you need to design your pure functional language with GPUs in mind, and that wasn't a consideration for the design of Haskell. I'm not claiming that Haskell is the ideal GPU programming language.</p>

<p>I hope one day in the future we can design programming systems on top of computational constructs like concurrency, parallelism, uncertainty, etc. and have hardware like GPUs, CPUs or networked machines be chosen dynamically without human design interventions for specific architectures.</p>
<p>These are all technically challenging and won‚Äôt always succeed, but for it to have a chance we‚Äôll need to change the direction of funding around, flowing from code requirements to hardware imperatives.</p>

<p>Modern GPUs are designed to maximize the percentage of silicon that contains ALUs, relative to the amount of control logic. It is an efficient way to use silicon, if your goal is to maximize the amount of compute that can be accomplished with a given transistor budget.</p>
<p>So we start with this super powerful hardware with monster compute abilities, and we build languages that let us easily program it.</p>

That talk was very profound for me, it just keeps providing nuggets of wisdom! Thanks again Garth!</p>
<p>At one point in the presentation, Alan Kay talks about when he was at Xerox Park, they could just tell the Intel guys to adjust the microcode on the CPU's. He goes on to say that modern FPGAs are the closest thing we have to that in the modern era.</p>
<p>As usual, Alan Kay is way ahead of his time! I hope he is right.</p>
<blockquote><p>My real hope is to remember&nbsp;&gt; computation&nbsp;&gt; is king, and hardware should be in support of the computation we‚Äôd like to do quickly.I disagree with this statement on some fundamental points. This statement implies that there is a fundamental adversarial hierarchy: Us Vs. Them; Software Vs. Hardware; One must submit to the other! This is a counterproductive view imo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My ideal future of hardware will come from better symbiosis of computation and hardware. Not domination of one over the other.</p>
<p>Referring to the Alan Kay talk again, Hardware and Software design used to be much closer together. A Programmer and a Hardware engineer would sit down and solve problems together, fighting the tyranny of Physics together üòõ.</p>
<p>My hope for the future is that this kind of symbiosis has a renaissance.</p>

<ul><li><p>There have been many, many attempts to create processors that operate on graphs. One of the more recent ones was by my research group in grad school 10 or so years ago: <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips"></a><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips</a>. But see also Dataflow architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture</a>), and MIT's Raw processor (<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/raw"></a><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/raw">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/raw</a>). While it's possible we're just one breakthrough away from making it work, it is an Open Research Problem.</p>
</li><li><p>Hardware people know what they're doing, far more than us software people. Whether that's because they're Superior Human Beings, or because their domain is easier, you seek to make hardware more like software at your peril. Imagine having to fix a security vulnerability in a chip instead of a compiler.</p>
</li><li><p>Hardware has less open source, and you seek to implement layers of software in hardware at your peril. Imagine having to convince your processor supplier of the value of open source. Imagine having to create a new programming language in nights and weekends in hardware. Now ask yourself why you would want to ask others to do something that hobbyists wouldn't do, to put up with a less malleable medium. The best ideas in computing have come from hobbyists. I want a more inclusive future, not less.</p>
</li><li><p>Python is Python only because all the hard stuff has native libraries that work with existing processors. If you plan to migrate those to pure Python, that gives up much of the benefit of using an existing language with a large install base. Might as well use a better language.</p>
</li><li><p>The term "von neumann bottleneck" is fundamentally about improving performance. Improving performance isn't in my top 10 major problems facing the future of software.</p>

<p>I realise how what I said may have come across, and want to clarify here I totally agree! I say computation in reference to the abstract notion of doing things with computers, wether through hardware or code. It was actually Alan Kay who inspired me to give that response though I forget from where.</p>
<p>Another way to put it might be to say that both hardware and software are things we invent to serve some computing goal, and we only sometimes know how they‚Äôll help.</p>

<p>My 10k ft perspective: hardware tools suck. Like, orders of magnitude worse than any software stack.</p>
<ul><li>Production tools for hardware are literally Tcl/Perl scripts that generate strings of Verilog code and smash them together.</li><li>Place&amp;route (lowering a design into wires on a board) takes potentially hours to run.

<p>Okay, jokes aside ‚Äî some people prefer to reuse terms ("tag", for instance, is used in a billion and one different contexts). Other people prefer to invent terms ("hypertext"), or pull terms out of obscurity (looking at you, "complect"). Each person has their own taste. There's no harm in any of these approaches as long as the context is adequately defined.</p>

<p>..."An object is instantiated from a class (template), which is its inherent and sole category. You can't re-categorize/re-purpose an existing object. Just like in the real world!"</p>
<p>..."An object has public and private members, because that makes them more 'secure' or something. Just like real life!"</p>
<p>..."An object has a fixed set of methods (behaviours) inherent to them. Systems don't have behaviour as a whole; behaviour belongs to individual entities, and they are all pre-defined before the system is turned on. Wow, reminds me of reality! Animals and pencils are both like this."</p>
<p>..."Objects change when other objects call their methods, and the world freezes whilst they change. Every object has total authority on whether its state changes; no external force has the power to change its state. Just like the real world!"</p>

<p>The ubiquity and utility of natural language is well known: almost all of the information we read, write/type, speak and hear every day is communicated via a natural language, not a specially-crafted one. Natural language is our primary means of understanding the world and interacting with other humans, especially in the absence of supplementary tools such as pen-and-paper (e.g. in face-to-face conversation). When was the last time you described a cause-and-effect phenomenon (a story, event, or task instructions) to someone without extensive use of natural language? At best, we use other artifacts (diagrams, formal models) as aids.</p>
<p>Despite the ubiquity and utility of natural language, if one person tries to "speak" a Java/C/JS/Rust program to another person, they have to go through an extremely complicated and lossy translation process from code to words. Based on some of my recent design work (not shared yet), I'm beginning to believe we could actually design programming languages whose "source code" consists solely of terse natural language sentences/structures with very specific syntax restrictions (to deny multiple interpretations / ambiguities). The language would not be accompanied by any supplementary symbols (!@#$%^&amp;]/-&gt;) with domain-specific meaning, since those would inhibit verbalization. Writing code in this language still requires careful deliberation (to develop the logic), but reading and discussing code with full verbalization becomes trivial: no translation is required at all!</p>
<p>Yes, I'm not the first person to think about putting natural language in PLs. Someone might bring up COBOL, HyperTalk, SQL, or similar. I'm not saying verbalizability is "the solution" to programming alone, but along with a well-crafted semantics (information model etc.), it could lead to something extraordinary.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to think further about this, Felienne Hermans <a href="https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663">https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663</a> (video is timestamped to that bit). Quote: "how does code sound?"</p>

Pronounceability is definitely a great thing, for accessibility if nothing else. I still can't imagine a system of "terse natural language sentences" that isn't hostile to at least one of precision or concision. I'd love to be convinced otherwise. Can you give a napkin-example of what you have in mind?</p>
<p>For pronounceability I would still follow the lead of mathematics as pronounced, e.g. "f of x equals forall y in d g of x and y". Whatever approach you take needs to have enough expressive power to balance out the bandwidth limit of at least speech, if not word-based notation (I like the idea of a conventional-looking system with operators that happen to all have reasonable pronunciations, which would keep the written syntax relatively compact).</p>
<p>OTOH: if you can just avoid the trap of phrases that look like multiple words but parse like a single token (in that they always have to be together in the same order), if you just let words be independently composable, you'll be head and shoulders above COBOL et al.</p>

I want readers to be able to verbalize an entire system, as if they were hearing a (detailed, accurate) description from a friend.</p>
<p>Regarding "following the lead of mathematics", my language is going to be extraordinarily light on functions (if I can get away with it), and thus on mathematical notation. Code re-use occurs through via interrelated rules that observe and produce abstracted data through pattern-matching. These act like polymorphic functions, so for most computations there is nothing to "call" and no need for mathematical primitives, no "f(x)". We can still retain that classical syntax for mathematical (numeric) expressions, though.</p>
<p>Regarding "multiple words that parse like a token", that shouldn't be a problem, because programs will be built through structured editing (AST etc) with appropriate autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I'll see if I can come up with a napkin example that I can actually defend! I'm still working on the semantics of my system, and I'm worried that an example wouldn't make sense to anyone else yet.</p>

This mechanism hasn't worked for digital notations because people  don't communicate about them orally.</p>
<p>A cultural practice of the Lisp community (in the widest sense, including Scheme etc.) that I have always appreciated is to value pronounceability of names. Which may seem surprising to all those who never take a closer look at Lisp because of all those parentheses. For me, Lisps are the PLs closest to natural language (but I have never used Cobol), and that's their strong point.</p>

In the end we realized that as long as you‚Äôre not writing full prose (e.g. limiting yourself to individual sentences rather than full paragraphs) the only form of ambiguity you really have to deal with is the edges between nodes in the sentence. For example, which object‚Äôs count does ‚Äúthe count‚Äù refer to? There are lots of simple heuristics we employ as humans to resolve that and in the end the only thing you really need to provide is a way to correct the edge if it‚Äôs wrong. In past projects we did that by exposing a formal representation of these linkages as a really simple nested list :)</p>
<p>In this particular case, we‚Äôve designed the language such that ambiguities are pretty rare, but certainly not impossible. The editor we‚Äôre building along side this has tools for helping you understand and fix ambiguity if it comes up. We also leverage things like autocomplete to guide you towards unambiguous formulations to being with. Reducing everything down to simple declarative statements and single line actions gives us a ton of leverage to make both the meaning of things clear and keep the editing experience really natural.</p>

<p>Other tools will put a vertical up/down control next to the field, and (like Yoshiki said) the cursor changes to give you a hint that it can be scrubbed.</p>
<p>On the other hand: number-type inputs in some web browsers are automatically scrubbable using the scroll wheel! So it's regretfully easy to accidentally scrub them when trying to scroll through the page. Argh!</p>

<p>This is what I did the last time I looked at it; auto discover the variable and add a slider in a space somewhere around it.</p>
<p>You can imagine a color swatch or some other style of widget to make it obvious; and allowing the user to add a comment to help identify the UI for ambiguous cases.</p>
<pre><code>float val; // widget-slider</code></pre><p>I agree that plain numbers aren't as discoverable, but the way they are drawn is different in the demo posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/domjancik">Dominik Janƒç√≠k</a> - with their black backgrounds.  I think you only have to 'discover' them once.  And a pop-up indicator with limits, etc. would be easy enough to do.</p>
<p>That said, I think I still prefer adding UI widgets inside the document, giving it more of the feel of a jupyter doc.  Indicating non-linearity or limits is much easier if you aren't restricted to text.</p>
<p>Another idea I had was to have the widgets 'cover' the text and fade back to editable text based on context, but I think this is probably too confusing.</p>

<p>TLDR; converting an algorithm or concept from a research paper into imperative code is often seen as tedious, but I think the process helps with learning and clarifying understanding. This is an underrated advantage of imperative code.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Do you agree or disagree? How can this idea of "reification" of algorithms be extended to other paradigms?</p>
<p>The long version:</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Coding Adventures by Sebastian Lague. He just release a new video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY</a></p>
<p>He skims over the details (the videos are more edutainment than true in depth education), but a strategy he seems to follow is to look at the top research papers on a subject, take the key equations, and implement those equations as shaders in Unity with HLSL i.e. a C derivative language.</p>
<p>This is a technique I'm very familiar with. I assume many people here are familiar with it as well. It can be tedious work to do this kind of translation, but it's hugely useful. I find that after doing a translation like that, I often have a much stronger understanding of the concept.</p>
<p>The way I truly understood integrals and summations was through implementing them as for loops.</p>
<p>I didn't understand monads and combinators until I implemented a parser combinator in an imperative language. In PHP no less. I was young and naive üòõ.</p>
<p>Many people in this community are fans of functional programming; there have been quite a few threads about ways to encode algorithms more effectively or "true to their mathematical form:" everything from APL to natural language to category theory.</p>
<p>This is a counterpoint against always looking for the "most efficient way" to encode an algorithm.</p>
<p>There is something about taking something "functional" and reifying it into a series of imperative steps that helps understanding a concept, at least for my personal learning style.</p>
<p>I have very little experience with visual programming, but things like Factorio (mentioned recently), make me think that reification as learning tool can be just as effective in the visual paradigm. How can this idea of "reification" of algorithms be extended to other paradigms, or taken into account more generally?</p>

No need to restrict this to imperative code. One trick I use to understand a difficult research paper is to write out the concepts in my own language (in English, I mean).</p>

For many people, that will be imperative code. That may be because the first programming language most people learn is imperative. Whether imperative programming is inherently easier to understand than function programming is a separate issue.</p>

While my personal experience agrees with Ray's, I have to conclude after looking around that the phrase "personal learning style" is key.</p>
<p>There's some overlap between this thread and my pet pedagogical approach of learning things bottom up. I found it easier to learn Haskell by ignoring layout rules and infix operators, and explicitly specifying the bounds of each function call.</p>

You are right to emphasize "personal learning style". (Maybe I should have emphasized that more.) The more I contemplate, the more I think that the important part is reification; making a concrete "thing".</p>

I have coincidentally implemented the same approach in the paper he used, as part of a game prototype I was playing with (some eye candy enclosed - must revisit this project at some point!)</p>
<p>My approach is probably slightly different though.  I'm  more of an 'implementer' than a scientist/academic, and I often struggle with hard math.  My approach is typically to iterate towards a goal in very small steps without getting bogged down in the detail; and it can take several days to get through the technical challenge.  I'm in awe of anyone who can read a paper full of Integrals and translate it to code.  That would be highly efficient!  I rely on following my nose and looking at sample code far more than the math.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I'm always messing with visualization tools and visual programming is that they are the only chance I have to understand.</p>
<p>"The way I truly understood integrals and summations was through implementing them as for loops." This + 1000, basically üòâ</p>
<p>And Monads.... I've read a few articles, but until I actually get to use one in a program I won't understand them.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sebastien is just really smart (I'm sure he is), but what intrigues me is, has he got to that place by building a set of tools and technologies around himself, such that he can break any problem up into pieces he understands?  i.e. The fact that he can plot and interact with graphs while building his code gives him a deeper/quicker understanding of each step?  Just more validation of Bret Victor's approach, I guess....</p>

Much of what you write down in mathematics and mathematically formulated science is specifications. For example differential equations such as Newton's. You really want to be able to write such specifications without necessarily doing something specific with them.</p>

I don't know where these experiments will lead, but I've got lots of ideas. Might take some time though as it's only a side project. </p>
<p>It's really interesting how much potential for improvement terminals have once you start thinking about it. If my experiments just showed some people that terminals aren't "done" and inspired them to think about innovations, I'd be happy with the result. That being said, I really want to make this a proper project I can use daily though. </p>

I really like Visual Studio Code, but for me it lacks the killer feature which makes Visual Studio (VC) better in my eyes.  In VC you can hit 'CTRL+,' (comma) and get a search box.  But the search is completely general, and fuzzy matched.  VC will search symbols, file names, function names, class names, etc. etc.  Effectively this somewhat 'hidden' feature lets you jump to anything you need while programming - instantly.  It is perfect because:</p>
<ul><li>Fingers never leave the keyboard, it takes &lt; 1 second to jump</li><li>Fuzzy matching means I can just type fragments</li><li>Searches everything relevant.The built-in search in Visual Studio Code unfortunately searches for either symbols or files depending on which command you invoke.  There is no combined search.  And in fact, I have not seen the same thing as VC in any other editor.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"><blockquote><p>üì∑ <a href="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T5TCAFTA9-F01940UJV0W/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<ul><li>Change the structure of my personal site so that all my pages are organized in a single chronological list, rather than on separate lists by year</li><li>Let me know when my website gets more than 5x the average traffic (without me having to build an API to expose traffic, because that's the hard part)</li><li>Let me know what sorts of searches people are doing where they should find my website, but aren't</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-08-21T06:19:16.025Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ivan Reese</span> <a href="#2020-08-21T06:19:16.025Z" class="date">2020-08-21 06:19:16</a> <div class="message"><p>Looking at your "Desktop" website in the Airtable gave me this thought:</p>

<p>I honestly think the feedback is missing the point here. I‚Äôm hearing ‚Äúthis remind me of Zapier‚Äù while the entire UX is different (which is most important but often overlooked). The subtitles of this project are also overlooked/ The fact that we can capture the users intent at point of thought ‚Äî I‚Äôve never seen before, especially to this caliber. Zapier products alike and the entire software industry require people to ‚Äúhold-on‚Äù to the thoughts and translate them into a medium that is not natural (unlike voice or text).</p>
<p>As for the confusion about bounty. We have examples of simple ‚Äúinvert this image‚Äù and ‚Äúcreate some Figma shapes‚Äù ‚Äî These are very different‚Ä¶ are they? They both have input and output. Image goes into box, inverted image comes out. Voice/text goes into box, Figma shapes come out. Both of these have been done before, both are products, both are solutions, both are hard to discover and hard to use. You may disagree with how hard, but take a moment to reflect on that‚Ä¶ think about what you have to do before you can leverage those technologies, think about how far you are from that software, think about the people that are not as brave as you to install several extensions, use the terminal, login to Zapier and diagram a simple, yet for some reason complex ask of the computer.</p>

<p>The sort of feedback we can give you is limited by the clarity of your description. Jack Rusher spoke to that really well. It feels like you have a really clear vision, but your description of it doesn't give us much to respond to. This is why people like to share mockups and prototypes ‚Äî&nbsp;they are more of a surface for our impressions to stand upon. People who share prototypes get better feedback. Instead, what we're doing here is more like sharing what we all think a cloud looks like.</p>

At the end of the day, that‚Äôs your job as the chief of evangelist of whatever project you‚Äôre pushing forward. Your goal isn‚Äôt to get people to fall in line and make them see things the way you do.

<p>Steve, I empathize with the frustration you're feeling. After putting many sleepless nights of work and thought into Eve, we had conversations in the Eve community that went in entirely unexpected directions too. That said, communities like FoC and Eve are folks who banded together because of a shared belief in something better. They've got every incentive to help each other, and if they're failing to do so, that likely means there's a serious issue preventing them from understanding how. It's particularly dangerous to assume the problem is that they don't care enough or aren't putting the time in -- these folks are dedicating their free time to try to help because they do want Storyscript to succeed. Suggesting otherwise is a very quick way to lose friends and advocates.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to try and revisit some of the feedback and see if you can find a way to tailor the message to help us engage with the idea more like you intended. As is, it seems pretty clear that there is a market segment full of the best evangelizers money can't buy who aren't connecting with it yet.</p>

<p>I went to university to study physics when I was still just a kid, several years younger the usual age, and when it came time to teach incoming freshman I was only 17 or 18 years old. It went very badly. For various path dependent reasons, I found most of the "hard parts" of maths and physics easy and natural, whereas they very much did not. My -- extremely embarrassing in retrospect -- perception was that they were being willfully thick just to vex me, and I was an absolute asshole to them for "not getting it" and "not trying hard enough" and so on.</p>
<p>Later, I read <a href="https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf"></a><a href="https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf">https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf</a> conducted by Elizabeth Newton regarding "Tappers and Listeners" that's since gotten repeated a bit in the popular science press, It really helped me to understand what was going on there and improve my own ability to communicate. The TL;DR of the study provided in Heath and Heath's Made to Stick conveys the point well enough:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tappers received a list of twenty-five well-known songs, such as ‚ÄúHappy Birthday to You‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Star Spangled Banner.‚Äù Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener (by knocking on a table). The listener‚Äôs job was to guess the song, based on the rhythm being tapped.&gt; </p>
<p>The listener‚Äôs job in this game is quite difficult. Over the course of Newton‚Äôs experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs: 3 out of 120.&gt; </p>
<p>But here‚Äôs what made the result worthy of a dissertation in psychology. Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, Newton asked the tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. They predicted that the odds were 50 percent. &gt; The tappers got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they were getting their message across 1 time in 2. &gt; Why?&gt; </p>
<p>When a tapper taps, she is hearing the song in her head. Go ahead and try it for yourself ‚Äî tap out ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù It‚Äôs impossible to avoid hearing the tune in your head. Meanwhile, the listeners can‚Äôt hear that tune ‚Äî all they can hear is a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre Morse Code.&gt; </p>
<p>In the experiment, tappers are flabbergasted at how hard the listeners seem to be working to pick up the tune. Isn‚Äôt the song obvious? The tappers‚Äô expressions, when a listener guesses ‚ÄúHappy Birthday to You‚Äù for ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner,‚Äù are priceless: How could you be so stupid?&gt; </p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to be a tapper. The problem is that tappers have been given knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine what it‚Äôs like to lack that knowledge. When they‚Äôre tapping, they can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like for the listeners to hear isolated taps rather than a song. This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has ‚Äúcursed‚Äù us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can‚Äôt readily re-create our listeners‚Äô state of mind.When we try to communicate something to a (virtual) room full of intelligent people operating in good faith and find that they cannot understand what we're saying, we have a choice: either accept that we haven't said our piece in a way that successfully translates the knowledge in our head -- which is necessarily much larger than the message we have transmitted -- or we can blame the listeners for our own failure. One way leads to effective communication and positive relationships, the other one to being the same kind of asshole I was in the cautionary tale with which I started this message.</p>

My first reaction was to draw a distinction ‚Äì&nbsp;snapping in AwM is a direct action on the artifact being created, while snapping in node-and-wire interfaces is only a direct action on the abstract structure of the program. But it's a really interesting point of comparison, and I think there's a lot of space to blur the lines between them.</p>
<p>For instance ‚Äì&nbsp;I haven't imagined that AwM would entirely eliminate the "spreadsheet" part of Apparatus. Snaps can't express all possible relationships between parts of a picture, especially when the parts are physically far apart. But where should these spreadsheet cells and links between them live? The node-and-wires model suggests that they could be present in the diagram's canvas, rather than a separate plane (like in Apparatus). Lots of interesting directions to go there!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Your phrase "separate plane" reminds me of map overlays as a possible solution.</p>
<p>You could represent much of that data as different views on the canvas, that can be switched between or overlaid on top of each other. GIS can be quite beautiful. üòõ</p>

Please can you recommend any good videos/papers/conferences/journals on programming language design.
I liked these :</p>
<p>Robert Virding - On Language Design (Lambda Days 2016) - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3rP3JRq7Mw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3rP3JRq7Mw</a>
- Why a programming language becomes messy. Erlang, for the phone system. Argues that we need more domain specific languages, rather than more kitchen sink style languages.</p>
<p>JavaScript: The Good Parts - (Google Tech Talks) - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook</a>
- Classic talk. While JavaScript has many problems, he covers the Good Parts of the language.</p>
<p>Alan Kay - Programming Languages &amp; Programming (2013) - <a href="https://youtu.be/prIwpKL57dM">https://youtu.be/prIwpKL57dM</a>&nbsp;
- Explains the need for better programming languages. Covers problems like, maintenance, Lines of code reduction, demos a very old scratch like system, and an old drawing system.</p>
<p>Wiki of Journals, publications, and conferences - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory#Journals,_publications,_and_conferences">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory#Journals,_publications,_and_conferences</a>
- I read a few, was hard to find topics of interest.  Would be handy if they were grouped by problem domain.</p>

If anyone has any feedback please let me know in this thread!</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-19T18:18:55.472Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-19T18:18:55.472Z">2020-05-19 18:18:55</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Jared Windover: </span> <p><p>Let me see if I understand: You’re using the mouse to select a rectangle, and checking all of the dom elements to see if they live inside of that rectangle, and including the ones that do, along with their children?
A few ideas:
• Can you just ignore children?
• What about: for each element you find in the rectangle, walk up the parent tree until you find a node that doesn’t live in the rectangle. The node before that is a top-level parent in your rectangle. If you find all of the top level-parents, and include all of their children, then you’ll probably not have the duplication issue. 
I’d be concerned about elements that don’t have boundingRects inside of their parent’s boundingRect, though (I think using <code>transform</code> can probably cause that). But if you’re including children regardless already, then you’d already have that problem.
• I think a more robust way to do this might be to walk the tree once (or on updates) and build a quad tree, or other space-partitioning lookup. Then you wouldn’t have to rely on parent-child relationships at all.</p>

General critiques of OOP, classes, inheritance, or dynamic typing — especially critiques of the form "these things are just bad, QED" — are outside the scope of my concerns at the moment.</p>
<p>I'm especially interested in hearing from folks who have worked with or (especially) built systems that use this style of inheritance, or who have considered using it in the design of a live programming environment but then decided not to.

Pain points... Don't do great with objects that have complicated life-cycles.  Tend to have trouble when collaborating with other objects.  When I clone this, should I clone this part?  When I clone this, should some list of whatever's now include the clone?  You need to think a lot about aliasing, the difference between a clone and a copy, and so on.  Prototypes have an advantage in systems that try to make objects tangible, like Self, since physical tokens work in a similar sort of way making for decent transfer.</p>

I'm coming at Self prototypes from a weird angle. I've done a lot (a lot —&nbsp;like 5-10k hours in a past life) of 3d modelling across a dozen tools. In those environments you often have fairly rich control over aliasing/instancing vs copying, and it's unambiguous. It was a good experience (eg: the "fragile base" is a powerful tool, not a pain point). Self feels only a small bit more complicated than that, which makes me think that a sufficiently rich GUI would make Self prototypes an equally good experience.</p>

By a hole, I mean a blank that can be filled in.  A parameter is like having a hole filled with a sort of nondeterminist value.  And with holes, as you add more and more, you find yourself in a very lambda calculus sort of world.  At which point, manner of expressing how to fill holes seems to matter more than the basic, fully realized object.  And getting all these notes to harmonize?  Well, that's the project.</p>

Above we see how even modeling of a single visual element can be split into tiny parts. Now, when we make some of those tiny objects behave like functions, we can get very interesting effects.</p>
<p>For example, a common issue in user interface design is to adjust the look of widgets. Often this is set through a global theme. We want to be able to affect the look of a single widget. CSS is an interesting source of inspiration, but when people want to affect the structure of the DOM, they resort to JS. Not quite the most elegant combination.</p>
<p>So, we introduced the concept of a look. Any element can get a look injected, and a look can affect everything in the element, including its structure and the way it handles events. The look is an object, but it acts like a transformation. Through object composition we can swap it in and out at runtime. In a way, a look is like a property of a prototype object (in Pharo, these would be called talents, or object traits). We find this to be quite powerful.</p>

&gt; the beauty of 3D instancing vs copying is that 3D objects are collections of triangles, textures, etc. which are all static in the sense that the component triangles don't affect each other. The more purely you enter the data domain, which is where Spreadsheets excel, the more tangible it gets.
Yes and no. In 3d, you hop up and down the ladder of abstraction at a blistering rate.</p>
<p>Yes, you'll spend a lot of time working at the level of individual verts, edges, tris, faces, but even then, you care immensely about the relationships between them. For instance: if you keep a strip or a ring of faces fairly uniform, it's easy to grab the thing and work with it as a set; by keeping face angles or areas consistent, you create an ad hoc geometric abstraction, and the tools are designed to help you do this and leverage that.</p>
<p>When you leave that lower level and start working with surface groups, meshes, objects, rigged collections of objects, etc., you're now working largely with nondestructive procedural modifiers, where tightly-controlled and well-understood relationships (and cross-cutting ones at that) become immensely important.</p>
<p>So even though the data is <em>at rest</em>, so to speak, you still need to grapple with abstraction, structure, interdependence, sequence, declaration vs procedure, memory vs computation cost (both of the data and the transformations), and so forth.</p>
<p><em>And then</em> when you start adding animation, physics simulation, particles, etc., your data is no longer at-rest, and changes to your supposedly "static" data like geometry in the small can have rippling consequences in the large. And again, there are enviably rich tools for helping you manage it.</p>

It's an 8x8 grid with 2 pieces of data per square (side, piece), and a handful of other data about whose turn it is, have the kings moved, etc., and the vast majority of the program is calculating legal moves, and handling the weird things like en passant capture and castling. I have programmed many things where logic dominated and data was very sparse. I found this pattern to be true, the top of the program is all graphical, and the bottom layers are all logic.</p>

<p>They're tools that require a kind of expertise, yes. But the ramp from novice to expert is enviably smooth, such that it can just be a matter of putting in the hours doing self-driven experimentation. In terms of the way you initially explore them, they're more like learning a musical instrument than learning a language (programming or spoken), in that they are almost completely self-revealing or self-discoverable.</p>
<p>That's what I'm after with my enthusiasm for live programming. An interested teenager should be able to learn how to program, from novice to intermediate, with just a dev environment and no other references or guidance.</p>

<p>I know so very little about Pharo and the GToolkit, and I owe it to myself to learn a lot more about these projects. From what I do know, they're seemingly the only things I can point to that share very many of the goals I have with my project, and have run into many of the same questions, and best of all have satisfying answers to those questions. To that end —&nbsp;I'd love to know what projects <em>you</em> are looking to as the high bar. What, if anything, is the existing work outside your own immediate sphere (so not Smalltalk / Self, say) that you would like to borrow from or build on?</p>
<p>(As an example / aside: I had a 4 hour drive today, and I re-listened to your episode of the FoC podcast. You talked a bit about the importance of having a single render tree, so that the visual tools, introspection, etc. all work universally, and there are no dead ends where you hit a flat &lt;canvas&gt;-like thing. I'm working on that very same problem right now, but I think my solution is different. I&nbsp;allow multiple render trees, so you can use whatever rendering technology best suits each kind of data — SVG for SVG, GL for 3d, HTML for documents, etc. But each tree must be nestable, and able to generate input, and must have a way to render the editor GUI, so that it can fully participate in editing, introspection, etc.)</p>
<p>The idea of "looks" makes a lot of sense to me. I clearly see the need, and the utility of this approach. You then go on to mention...</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>In a way, a look is like a property of a prototype object (in Pharo, these would be called talents, or object traits). We find this to be quite powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't quite follow this simile, though. And —&nbsp;are these "traits" the same as in Self, or have they changed in the time since?</p>

<p>About one rendering tree, we describe it here:
<a href="https://medium.com/feenk/one-rendering-tree-918eae49bcff?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c0551af8504ee919c4d8c54c390eef49">https://medium.com/feenk/one-rendering-tree-918eae49bcff?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c0551af8504ee919c4d8c54c390eef49</a></p>
<p>In essence, we wanted to have visualizations as first class, and we wanted to be able to connect anything with anything live. That meant that graph layouts had to become regular layouts and that there should be no black boxes: for example, a text editor must be representable in the same tree, too.</p>
<p>Once we had that tree, it meant that we had one way of propagating events and that we could affect and connect anything from anywhere.</p>
<p>About traits/talents: traits offer a static composition mechanism (like interfaces with implementation). An object trait (or talent) is a mechanism for injecting behavior in a specific object only.</p>

I'm bothered that typical links (e.g. into a google doc) jump into a completely different context rather than pulling in the relevant <em>slice</em> of information into the current context. Now it's hard to say in practice how fluid this will feel. I'm not that familiar with Notion blocks, but this idea has been around (Chris mentioned OLE).</p>

I can only think of one invention, Hololens, to emerge from MS's huge research division.

But my whole career I've struggled with a problem: How do you make a document for others to read, that contains embedded media that was made in other programs, and then share that document in a manner where others can then edit both the document, and the embedded media? And when I saw that little movie of embedding a Whimsical diagram into a Notion document, I was like "that's it, that's the solution".</p>

I wanted to share what I’ve been working on at Airtable  - a new way to build apps! Today, Airtable is kicking off the developer preview of Custom Blocks with a $100,000 developer contest. With Custom Blocks, we’re letting developers increase the power of Airtable by building highly composable components on top of our end-user-friendly real-time database.</p>
<p>Now you can spend 100% of your time focused on what makes your app unique and leave the rest to Airtable. The best part? Custom Blocks are built with Javascript and React. You can leverage npm’s 1,200,000+ modules to build almost anything you can imagine.</p>

I hadn't gotten around to checking out Airtable yet, though I have some read-only access to it for my day job. I wonder if you could help me think through some preliminaries.</p>
<p>When I look at <a href="https://airtable.com/pricing">https://airtable.com/pricing</a> it sounds like these custom blocks will after some promotional period slot in at the $20/user/month "Pro" pricing level. Is that accurate? If so, it seems like it's geared towards enterprise usage rather than hobbyists (particularly since a single person may need multiple license 'seats' to collaborate in different spaces with different groups). Am I thinking about this the right way?</p>
<p>I don't intend this as criticism. We've had similar discussions in this group about our usage of Slack, now that we're starting to run up against the restrictions of the free tier. And my lesson from that experience is to be more thoughtful about whether I am in the target market before I adopt a new tool.</p>

“Programming” is an art and it has many mediums and abstraction layers. Just like in art and language and math, there are differnt requirements at different levels of need. Languages are not abstracted enough… but we do have hope. I can “code” without code already. “Alexa, what is 1+1” It’s basic… yes… but it’s betting smarter. With time, it will do things like <code>weekly, look at the forecast and adjust the number of drivers required to deliver food by comparing average orders and weather</code></p>

<p>I share some of the earlier concerns in this thread that it might be very difficult to tell what's going on when things <em>aren't</em> working as intended— not just in terms of how the syntax is being parsed, but what the compiler and resultant program are actually <em>doing</em>.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of programming—&nbsp;mental simulation of invisible processes—&nbsp;is not really fixed by making the program into plain English. I'd hypothesize that an unambiguous notation is actually an aid to mental simulation, not a hindrance (it removes some guessing/degrees of freedom about what the computer might be thinking).</p>
<p>Of course the use of a symbolic notation itself requires more complex mental simulation (i.e. of a parser/lexer/compiler), and this "bootstrapping problem" adds yet another layer of difficulty that makes even getting started with programming so hard for many beginners. But I think it's a big fallacy to think that removing this initial barrier is what will open up programming. It's just the first hurdle; after that comes a lifetime of mentally emulating every program you work with.</p>
<p>It's my thesis that the future of programming will not come about until the need for mental simulation is largely removed. But this is a really interesting and unexpected peek into perhaps another, new niche of programming.</p>

This is just not solvable unless you can solve the exceptions problem. Ripple Down Rules explains the problem, and describes a good human solution. The issues relates to rules. Rules typically have exceptions. This was made clear by some guy trying to create an expert system in a hospital. Experts would come to him with new rules for the expert system. He would code them in. Then they would come with a new rule than was an exception to the old rule. And so he invented Ripple Down Rules. This is a problem for coding, because, you need to uncover the exceptions. When given a text description of a problem, a lot of what a programmer does is look for the exceptions to the rule, the edge cases. Then they make a judgement call of if to include code that handles the exception or not. If you look at a program, sometimes it is mostly exceptions. It required a human to extract all the exceptions and then code them.
Until a computer can work through a text description of a problem, and some how uncover the exceptions, I don't think we will see this kind of thing working.</p>

<p>It seems like the compiler is doing a sort of "fuzzy match" (?), so not being an AGI, it will certainly not guess correctly what the programmer meant in all cases. So when that happens, the human will be tasked with figuring out what the computer <em>thought</em> they meant.</p>

&gt; The most difficult part of programming—&nbsp;mental simulation of invisible processes—&nbsp;is not really fixed by making the program into plain English. I'd hypothesize that an unambiguous notation is actually an aid to mental simulation, not a hindrance (it removes some guessing/degrees of freedom about what the computer might be thinking).
I totally agree. With ambiguous systems based on natural language programming, there is a new source of complexity: for some task it can be tricky to find/guess the sentence that will make the compiler produce the behavior that you want. And maybe one compiler will "choose" one behavior that will be different than the one chosen by an other compiler. We only have this kind of problem with "unambiguous" languages where some compilers/interpreters behave differently on some parts of some standard (like C or JavaScript).</p>

I occasionally "resort" to mathematical style notation when English is getting clumsy - i.e. added brackets or using set notation. This is most common in reading legalese. I genuinely believe laws would be more approachable if written in pseudo-code.</p>
<p>I think this is rare though. Natural language is normally unambiguous. It's more common to see, for example, natural language comments elucidating a piece of code. These two sentences convey essentially exactly the same semantic information;
1. Copy the value of the 'eax' register into the 'eab' register
2. mov ebx eax

<p>To get something like "do my taxes" to execute on a processor, we have to somehow translate "do my taxes" into a series of processor instructions that can be physically realised. This is like "essential compilation". Every stage of this process can perfectly well be described unambigously in natural language.</p>
<p>Separately to this, there might be an essentially arbitrary set of "compilation" between different programming languages.</p>

In the history of software we are in an unusual phase that shows the need for antitrust regulations.</p>
<p>The one bright aspect of today's marketplace is that it is now accepted by some to pay a subscription fee for software and that gives companies much greater financial strength compared to the old days of shrinkwrapped product that had an initial purchase with perhaps an upgrade or two down the line. I actually prefer the fixed price model, as that is how i buy hammers and other durable tools. If a software tool is well made it won't need constant updating.</p>

They did the simple stuff…. how is that impressive? What about the hard stuff? I don’t think it will anything to say about it. Python and essentially every single language has constructs and design principles that require abstraction and refactoring when the domain changes or knowledge is exposed. <code>this function reverses a list</code> is nothing. <code>this function fetches our customers from stripe and filters by company, then cross checks the results against our salesforce</code>…. now that is something real</p>

<p>If someone said to you, “Weekly, look at the forecast and adjust the number of drivers required to deliver food by comparing average orders and weather,” wouldn’t you start by looking at your tools an <em>compiling</em> your available actions into a <em>procedure</em> to achieve your goal? You might defer some of that work, and you might keep the original request in mind to evaluate your effectiveness and correct course over time, but so long as the request is made using language and not a timed series of motor commands injected as electrical impulses directly into your brain stem, it seems compilation is an essential part of the process of doing someone else’s work… yet you seem to hate compilation in every form people have discussed today, be it template matching of pseudo-English all the way down to machine code, or ML-based machine translation to Python—but somehow compilation of short English phrases to Storyscript gets it right?</p>
<p>Like… what if PEP bottomed out at Storyscript, or the OpenAI system emitted Storyscript, allowing someone to write three Storyscript statements using only one command? Neither of those systems were written to preclude this, but you act like their existence is unjustified because they don't.</p>

<p>I agree with steve here - an ML trained on a bunch of snippets from github/SO is 99% sure not to have or understand what I’m doing when I’m juggling the domain abstractions. Yeah it could help with writing down the boilerplate, but wtf do we even write boilerplate then? Just make a template instead of making an “AI”.</p>

<p>The bodies of these functions were written by the ML model and required making several design decisions without human intervention, about how values should be computed, what nearby methods could be reused, and what output should look like. I think in any other context, we'd call the parts that the human wrote "boilerplate" and the parts that the computer wrote "programming".</p>

<strong>Joshua Cole</strong> was spot on when hinting at verifying generated code. The system may have come up with multiple potential candidates, How do you pick them? How do you provide the extra context or params when required. <strong>Tom Lieber</strong> I promise you that this demo was hacked… I have little confidence that the results you see are fully using OpenAI.

This is a pattern that I'd expect to be well-represented in the corpus of training material available on github, and so I'd expect the AI to usually get close. Particularly when using logical constraints as part of the generation process (think techniques like SRL). Occasionally, close will end up being completely correct. The issue with trying to use this for writing production code is that even an 80% success rate on individual expressions produces a <em>lot</em> of bugs over time without skilled programmers constantly debugging newly generated additions. I think it's probably a wash for most programmers to try to use this for development (assuming it's in that state), but reflecting more on it, this seems like potentially a <em>huge</em> <em>accessibility</em> boost for programmers who are blind or have lost dexterity. Definitely an avenue worth exploring more on the road to AGI. 🙂</p>

<p>In general, you'll gain much more from evaluating things from the prospective of how they <em>could</em> work, rather than assuming they're impossible and the people behind them are just using smoke and mirrors. It's also better for the community if we assume people are showing things in good faith, instead of trying to trick you.</p>

In their demo, if you remove just one word it would fail to produce the code because that one less word created ambiguity that no AI can resolve because the answer is in your head.</p>

I do think however, based on experience and research in this category, that the words which were seeded to OpenAI were methodical and predefined. Like as if “If you say this exact phrase, we can generate this code”. I say this with confidence because if you change even small parts of the sentence than you lose scope/context and add ambiguity which the AI cannot understand.</p>

I'm working on DataPipes a flow-based editor for macOS. That is kind of my tribute to QuartzComposer that introduced me to the idea of flow-based programming. I always wanted to use this approach to something else than graphics - and here it is.
The main idea is to use flow-based approach to dealing with data without touching code and as a result make it easier to use real(istic) data in the design process.</p>
<p>Here is the short screencast of the current alpha version, any feedback highly appreciated!</p>

DataPipes should allow its users to quickly build something useful for prototyping needs. Easy to tweak, refactor, and change without coding.

<p>My main feedback is in two parts:
- how are you imagining implementing repeating lists with randomization within? R u thinking the Iterator route from QC or Spreads from Vvvv?
- big reason QC was so great was live refresh, would love to see this work without clicking that button at the top and refreshing in the browser (maybe quick hack to use python httpwatcher to reserve)</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Re: lists - as of now there two ways already builtin - either the generator node has 'Repeat' port that takes the number of generations to make, or you can use sequences, something closer to iterator pattern than strictly imperative loop with its body</li><li>Live refresh - that's absolutely a priority for me too, so the current connect-run-repat chore will be gone forever</li><li>Sharing - from the very beginning I was thinking about the flow runtime engine to be ready to work on the server as well.

Also, i consider LOC a very bad unit of measurement for comparison purposes because some languages like LISP, APL, and FORTH are more horizontally oriented, and so i use word instead of lines. Words compares code sizes much more accurately. Yes people are not used to thinking in terms of words, but line count drastically undercounts more combinatorial languages. 100 lines of APL might include the name number of words (tokens) as 300 lines of C.</p>

They failed miserably because the leader of the project was too enamored of PROLOG at the level it was at, and could not see the limitations of that system as it was at that time. It didn't translate well into useful technology that they could apply in the key areas they were working in, and Japan in terms of software development was dead in the water until Playstation and Nindendo revitalized their fortunes. Today, Japan's games are among the best made. But anyway I like how you have created higher level constructs for storing knowledge, and tiered the information, and of course handling multiple machines at once, each of which can communicate with each other, is 10 times harder to program than a single machine which was all PROLOG supported.</p>

I have been going through listening to all the podcasts from the start because I find this whole topic deeply fascinating and want to make sure im up to date with everything before I start contributing here. I have one question however. In episode 3 "Inventing on Principle" with Jonathan Leung.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Krouse</strong> and Jonathan discuss a whole bunch of really interesting things but Jonathan talks about an app I think he calls "Workflow" that he uses whenever he works on a task to help him structure how he tackles the problem. He mentions that he has shown the technique to many other people and they have all adopted it since. I would love to know more about this App and / or technique. Does anyone have any sources?</p>

Then Steve jumps into a discussion of his dream git workflow where each item on the todo list is a branch of the repo that you "cross off" by merging it back into master. (I say dream because IIRC he imagines it having tool support that AFAIK he never wrote.)</p>

To quote myself from a couple of months ago:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>The authors' "ideal world" is one where computation has no cost, but social structures remain unchanged, with "users" having "requirements". But the users are all mathematical enough to want formal requirements. They don't seem to notice that the arrow in "Informal requirements -&gt; Formal requirements" may indicate that formal requirements are themselves accidental complexity.

But I don’t think the big ideas in the paper require having a complete problem specification. A more charitable interpretation might be: they start with a basic model of software development and its problems.</p>
<p>Like all models, it’s wrong, but it still usefully describes a subset of realistic situations. In those situations, the techniques the authors promote could help reduce complexity.</p>

For a long time, writing gnarly C++ and vector intrinsics was the only way to go. And this meant a lot of mistakes, challenging optimization, so on.

<p>If Halide is to be experimental evidence for this paper, you have to motivate why <em>this</em> particular paper over previous papers by Brooks (essential complexity) or Codd (relational state) or Parnas (decoupled design) or Knuth (stepwise refinement).</p>

And you're right I think: it would help if a node with a slider or other kind of input control also gets updated when the history slider is moved. In one of your video's I actually saw something similar, which was my inspiration to build this history slider. In the past I have experimented with a small list of payloads to show on the side of the screen, and for debugging purposes to add additional debug-nodes. But this works better.</p>

In the future I also want to make the editing of a node easier with a proper form editor or with a more visual approach (the onchange property should actually be a special kind of connection, for other similar properties this is already partly implemented)</p>

Because by manipulating payload properties you can make loops. The flow in this screenshot is an implementation of the quicksort algorithm, just to see if that would be possible with the flowrunner. It even has a recursive function ðŸ˜‰. The blue lines are hidden connections which are configured in the nodes (here it are connections to the node where the list is stored which should be sorted). I also want to visualize the 'onChange' properties of the slider-node of the other examples like this.</p>

Orca does indeed schedule immediately, but those generated notes  are effectively played after a small delay when the arrive at whatever Synth you are using; you just don't notice.  It should be a similar situation here; and although I am testing far into the future, in reality I will probably be scheduling much more closely to 'now'.  I'm trying to plan a for a future containing a music generation language I've been working on, alongside Orca.   Although Orca is very fast, a music language may not be as fast.   I know, for example, that Sonic Pi has a delay of 250-&gt;500ms which is added to generated notes.   By scheduling a little bit into the future, there is I hope more time to generate and align notes correctly.  My sense is that i need this flexibility, but we will see.  Pattern languages also let you 'see' into the future, since you can run the pattern forward; so the concept of what is happening 'next' is something I want to at least be able to see.</p>

Very interesting problem space, considering every system will have a different characteristic latency to be compensated for.</p>

<ol start="1"><li>When you want to connect two things that are far apart on the page (at 0:50), you grab one and then drag it to the top of the page, and then wait while the page scrolls up.</li><li>When you drag the slider (1:04), the select table grows and shrinks. Since you're looking at the slider, which is below the table, the whole page jumps up and down.</li></ol></p></div><div id="2020-05-21T18:37:43.409Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-21T18:37:43.409Z">2020-05-21 18:37:43</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Mariano Guerra: </span> <p><p>for 1 I have the basket, I don't always use it but for long drags it's really useful, for 2, yes, I've noticed it too and I don't  know yet how to best solve it, I was thinking some sort of portal and/or side by side temporary view to see effects of one cell into another one, open to ideas on this one</p>

If so, can you copy-paste them to achieve the same thing as a drag?</p>
<p>For 2, I've tried solving this problem by adjusting the scroll position to compensate for changing element sizes higher up on the page, but that never worked well enough for me to ship it. I've compensated by basically removing things from the DOM when they're outside the view, so that they can't mess with scrolling, and then reinserting them into the DOM in response to a user action. I don't think that'd work in your case, though. So perhaps the idea of pulling controls out of the main flow is the best bet. You've certainly got a lot of horizontal space to play with in your layout, so you could maybe carve off room for a panel along the left or right that could house vertical sliders and other controls. * shrug *</p>

Now I'm abstracted, it won't be hard to try other approaches.</p>

In Beads you have the concept of a monitor program that can run another program inside a window. This is useful for performance analysis and automated testing. I expanded the Builder program to have a toggle switch which shows the number of times each function/subroutine in the system has been called. By identifying functions with 0 calls you can see which parts of your code have not been tested.  <a href="https://youtu.be/rW3H_BR7gLk">https://youtu.be/rW3H_BR7gLk</a>  This counts are also useful for identifying super high frequency utility functions, as those are strong candidates for putting in time on performance. It is always better to measure frequency of use before trying to optimize your code.</p>

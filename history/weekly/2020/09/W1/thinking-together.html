I remember watching your talk about the thing you‚Äôre making and I think you mentioned something along these lines being one of the big problems. I was surprised you wanted to be able to prove theorems in this system because of course a visual environment and proofs have this tension. I‚Äôm curious what kind of proofs you would have in this system. In the video you mentioned a theorem in quantum computing(?) but I couldn‚Äôt find it. As an elementary but nontrivial example how would you prove the Pythagorean theorem? I think you would have to do this abstractly, but as long as it is ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù you can unfold the abstract proof at various stages and apply it to specific vectors to visualize it.  Also, if you are doing proofs I imagine these would be ‚Äúformal proofs‚Äù and isn‚Äôt that a really tough problem? Or do I misunderstand or is there some way to get around it? eg just have a more expressive and dynamic means to write informal proofs. Anyway I certainly wouldn‚Äôt shy away from general variables as long as you have a means to move up and down the ladder of abstraction üòâ. </p>

Remember Bret's Ladder of Abstraction.  For extra fun, have interactions between the multiple values.  For instance, instead of a solution set of values that would work in a given context, have a probability distribution.

We went so far as to replace classic tests with examples (a test that returns an object). This leads to a nicer way to compose examples, but most importantly, examples offer concrete objects you can program against. As in our environment every object can present itself through custom views and as these views can also be weaved into larger narratives, the examples also offer a nice infrastructure for documentation purposes. Here is a short article about them:</p>

This is an interesting philosophical issue and may end up being a problem for me, but I'm willing to bet that it will be sufficiently non-small</p>
<p>The kinds of proofs I am interested to give are (as you'd expect) fundamentally GA-related, so for example, proving that rxr* is a rotation when r is a rotor and r* is its reverse and x is a vector. Or, expanding a bit, classical mechanics, so proving that ellipses are solutions to the two-body problem. And yes, if I get to it, quantum computing! Subalgebra closure is probably what you were thinking of. It wouldn't be super surprising if the system ends up somewhere in between "strong enough to prove pythagorean theorem" and "strong enough to prove QM subalgebra closure"</p>
<p>"How would you prove the pythagorean theorem?" Thanks a lot for asking me that question, it's a great example to start with and I'd not thought about it :D and now I've thought about it and I know how to prove it. It's a combination of defining a "right angled triangle" by the constraints that are on it (which are visual) and then applying the rules of geometric algebra, which are all visual, to that constraint. I can say more but it might just sound weird/spoil the fun when you eventually see it üòõ</p>

I‚Äôm interested in using it strictly as a primary programming interface. Few people would argue that we should have deep learning models interpreting all of our code (plaintext) to take action based on educated guesses about what we wanted to say (if you think that, that‚Äôs a separate discussion). I‚Äôm just exploring a syntax based on logic (i.e. explicitly broken into logical units with a well-defined semantics) but expressed in natural language (so that it is human-readable without having studied a course on logic).</p>

This can take many forms.  Here's an example.</p>
<p>Step 0: Setup</p>
<p>Imagine a fairly conventional imperative system.  We have a bunch of boxes (variables) in which we can put values.</p>
<p>Step 1: Observable</p>
<p>We show which values go which boxes in what order.  Often systems let us check state only in the moment or keep dubious logs about what happened in the past.  Forget asking about the future.  Imagine lining up the boxes.  We might be able to scrub forward and backward through time, or add a timeline showing what values were in each box when.</p>
<p>Step 2: Manipulatable</p>
<p>Good old structured programming is kind of nice on this front.  Each assignment statement records how the contents of a box change.  Suppose we directly manipulate the boxes in some other way, then we can record a script of the assignments made.  Glue scripts together.  Good, clean fun.</p>
<p>Step 3: Constrainable</p>
<p>Except we don't abstract cleanly from the step-to-step to composable recipes.  With functions/procedures, we keep track of arguments and return values, but we don't keep track of what boxes get examined or updated.  We can't easily tell if ordering of calls matters, and we cannot easily require that things always happen in a certain order.</p>

Eve was much better than conventional languages on some axes, but on the axis of expressing process-like things it was significantly worse.</p>

E.g. <code>earth &lt; solar system &lt; galaxy &lt; alpha quadrant</code>  and <code>second &lt; minute &lt; hour &lt; day</code>.</p>
<p>Graphs are appealing when we think of peers and relationships (the set of buildings in a city). You can have arbitrary relationships but you don't get the canonical path to each node. I don't think one is always more intuitive.</p>
<p>IMO the bigger problem is our biases in 'meta models'. We have the idea of what a "data structure" is, we pick exactly one and get 'locked in' permanently to that one view. We may want multiple parallel views of the information based on what we're tying to do. But none of the usual models or type systems do this well. If you look at programming, a lot of it is 'changing the shape' without adding any new information. E.g. transform a JSON object into a struct; load an array of structs into a dict for faster lookup, extract one field of many structs into an array etc. There's conflation between data structure and information structure and we haven't figured out how to separate these nicely.</p>

<p>If you know anyone in high school or college who isn‚Äôt studying CS, try looking at their personal notebooks or journals.</p>
<p>I think people often store information in narrative form. The narrative gives many contact points with the same piece of information.</p>
<p>A particularly adept learner might write about what they learned in many ways: how it applies to their life, where they have seen it in the world, the strict technical definitions, and some metaphors that capture the essence of the subject.</p>
<p>We want to look at the same information in as many ways as possible so we can get an intuitive sense for it. Something that we understand deeply can represent itself as a felt-sense in the body, as opposed to an intellectual thought, like a grandmaster chess player analyzing his position on the board, or a tennis player analyzing the trajectory of a ball.</p>

<p>Since it seems that most data structures are actually ways of organizing information, rather than understanding information, it can be hard to draw lots of comparisons between how a human might organize information (since humans most often want to organize their information by understanding it ‚Äî e.g. storing it in their body, as opposed to storing it in a physical location somewhere)</p>

I think music-as-programming has more of a home in video games than general programming, because the great difficulty seem to me to be the invention (and comprehension!) of grammars that map musical feature to semantic behavior.  The only method I've seen is essentially a complex keyboard shortcut: a specific sequence maps to a specific function, like the song fragments in Ocarina of Time or the spells in Before the Echo.</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine something like musical brainf*ck, or maybe a slightly more sophisticated macro system where the user develops a mapping of musical structure to program structure (e.g., this chord represents this variable; this melodic fragment following this chord represents this method call), but that's just regular programming with extra steps. Could be run to write a program that you can then perform, though, or to generate mappings aleatorically and use small programs as sight-reading material--or if you really hate yourself, write a JIT compiler that makes random mistakes when you do, so you have to perform the program perfectly to get it to compile correctly. These are all esoteric use cases, though.</p>
<p>But consider the limited expressivity of a musical language, like the hmmmmm system described in the link. This is why I think music + video games is a good combination. Imagine the grammar is provided and structures map to interesting behaviors--running, jumping, dashing, guarding, rolling, targeting enemies, attacking, casting spells--a musical interface could be a fun way of "programming" the world, or at least of improvisationally triggering simple scripts written in a user-friendly language. I like to imagine Hollow Knight-esque boss fights where the "score" of the fight is a set of musical+visual telegraphs that tell you what the boss is about to do, and your job as the player is to respond with an appropriate musical phrase (dodge/guard/attack). The record of the fight becomes a piece of music written as a structured improvisation between a computer and a human within the rules provided by the game developer/composer.</p>
<p>But these are just pipe dreams. Like I said, I haven't seen music in programming systems, and for the difficulties of grammar, I don't think we're likely to.</p>

<p>DevonThink</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the fundamental difference between TDD and coding by example?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put things a different way, TDD is about a human providing examples and then a human coding to make those examples work. Programming by example is about allowing a human to provide example and then the program is automatically derived from that example.</p>
<p>More in line with what <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> is talking about is this section from Bret Victor‚Äôs magic ink that goes into more in depth with an example. <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#designing_a_design_tool"></a><a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#designing_a_design_tool">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#designing_a_design_tool</a></p>
<p>In fact in this essay, there is a quote that relates the kinds of things Jack talked about to the kinds of things I was discussing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many systems attempt to infer a full computational procedure, and have the most difficulty with computational concepts such as conditionals and iteration. As we will see, this tool mostly has to infer mappings from some set or numerical range to another‚Äîfunctions in the mathematical sense rather than the (imperative) computational sense. This may be significantly easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barliman is a system that tries to infer full computational procedure. The systems Jack is talking about are much more inline with what Bret is achieving, inferring particular relations given a graphical input.</p>
<p>The point of my example in my talk is that there might be some way in which we can take ourselves much further into inferring from examples to computational procedures, by changing up our programming models.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the work that Jack linked, but I would love to see programming by example become a more general technique useful beyond domain specific cases and with some nice underlying model that can be broadly applied. In other words, I just want to work from the ground up to get something that can power the various awesome projects that Jack posted without having to code those interactions specifically.</p>

I.e. people that didn‚Äôt learn to program initially but want or need to sometimes.</p>
<p>Last week I have discussed with someone that could be interested in this kind of tool. And during the discussion about her use case, something appeared very clearly. In her journey in using programming, there are good chances that at one point she will need help from more experienced people. My feeling after that discussion is that this will be very common and that it is very important to take this into account early in the vision and the design of such tools or in the building of the community around it.</p>
<p>I.e. creating tools that allow non-experts to program, make them feel it is normal to not know everything, making it really easy for them to find some help, and make it easy for a more experienced programmer to give help for the programming task.</p>
<p>I guess I had this idea/feeling for some time, but I really feel its importance after that discussion.</p>
<p>What do you think of that? Do you have examples of tools/communities where this is taken very seriously? Or any research work on this? Be it for end-user programming or not (in fact even experts need help from ‚Äúmore‚Äù experts).</p>

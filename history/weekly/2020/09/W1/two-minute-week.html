<p>I need closure because I've gotten excited recently about dropping my dependency on the Linux kernel, and a way to provide graphics without an OS.</p>
<p>Using BIOS.</p>
<p>waves hands. No, wait, come back. Check this out: <a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532"></a><a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532</a>. While using *VGA primitives is never going to give a large screen resolution or 60fps games, I think it might give us some nice new capabilities for very little code.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think of the BIOS as "a standard instruction set for all the other hardware besides the processor." That seems fruitful.

<p>The real problem down this road is input. A keyboard will be fine. A mouse seems iffy but hopefully doable. But pressure-sensitive multi-touch, fuggedaboudit. So no minority-report-style FoC demos in Mu's future. Oh well. I'm not even sure what a reasonable API for multi-touch looks like, so I'm not going to worry about it for now.</p>

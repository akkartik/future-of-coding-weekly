I bet a lot of people here have experience sharing their ideas with others, and maybe not quite getting the response they were looking for. Either they think the idea is bad, or that it's too similar to an existing idea. What's the absolute best way to respond in that kind of feedback? Assuming the goal is to facilitate more feedback (with the kind of work we do here, the more feedback the better), but also give yourself the opportunity to address criticism to inform the discussion.</p>

People almost never have to give you feedback, and it's almost always helpful. After that, if I feel it's appropriate, I try to give a thoughtful response. I find it's difficult to do this without sounding defensive though, so that's a particular area I wonder if there's a technique or mental model that would help to not get your emotions involved.</p>

Here‚Äôs all things I think about :</p>
<ul><li>First filter, should I even process this? What medium / context was it given through? Social media feedback I‚Äôve found to be anecdotally very useless. A long Github comment with helpful context or suggestions is better. Is the feedback personal / a personal attack? I almost immediately walk away!</li><li>Assuming it made it past the quality filter.. I think about their context and my context. If someone is complaining about an issue but doesn‚Äôt meet my targeted personas I‚Äôm supporting (even though we dream of supporting the amorphous ‚Äòeverybody‚Äô, there‚Äôs always some optimized set of personas IMO) then I try to factor that in. It could be that their feedback is reasonable, but not relevant to my own goals for the project.</li><li>What‚Äôs the situational context. Are they a customer / potential customer or an OSS contributor, a user, or just a critic? For the first one I agree with being very nice and thankful and friendly and maybe seeking more clarity.</li><li>What‚Äôs the underlying / hidden truth or kernel in what they‚Äôre saying? This is something product managers know well. People say things like ‚ÄúI want to do X feature on your site locally‚Äù but sometimes they really just want the speed of the feature to be FAST on your website. So you may have to dig deeper.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-09-01T19:26:16.001Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Jack Rusher</span> <a href="#2020-09-01T19:26:16.001Z" class="date">2020-09-01 19:26:16</a> <div class="message"><p>The design education process is one of the best I've encountered for actively fostering a culture of giving and receiving a good critique.

Purely negative feedback ("this is crap", "why would you waste your time on that?") usually comes from people who wish you ill, but the best critical feedback comes from those who want you to succeed, and who are well-intended in their criticisms (that's not to say that this sort of feedback can't be incisive -- it often is, but i'll deal with that later). In my view, the only feedback that you should consider acting on is that which comes from the sorts of people who mean well. But just like hearing your mother shouting "clean your room!", it is often difficult and uncomfortable to deal with such advice, and it often comes across as curt or abrasive. The best way I've found is to look at feedback, not as a criticism of my "self", but rather as being critical of some work I've produced or some action I've taken. That may sound clich√©, but if someone's well-intentioned criticism of your work bothers you deeply, you need to examine your personal reasons for why that is the case. Like Marcus Aurelius said: ‚Äúwe all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own‚Äù üå≥</p>

<blockquote><p>if someone's well-intentioned criticism of your work bothers you deeply, you need to examine your personal reasons for why that is the case.If you've worked hard on something, and you're invested in it, the expectation is that criticism would bother you, is it not? Well-intentioned most of all, I'd imagine, because then it's more likely to be true? That's sort of what I'm looking for, what's the mental model you'd use to remove emotion from the equation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples would take too much context unfortunately, but generally, I'm talking about good feedback. And I guess I would say I usually respond fine. Re Aurelius, I'm actually pretty internally motivated. But something still always bothers me, these interactions never feel graceful. I always feel like I gave something up when I respond if that makes any sense. So I was wondering how others handle it and think about it.</p>

<p>When it comes to responding to feedback with grace, that‚Äôs definitely an art, and one that I need to practice on a daily basis. In addition to putting myself in the feedback-giver‚Äôs shoes, it‚Äôs helpful to do things to moderate my reactions in the moment: ‚Äúpressing the pause button‚Äù, so to speak, is super underrated. Whenever possible, I try to wait a length of time that‚Äôs proportional to the intensity of my initial reaction to a criticism I get before I respond to it. In cases where I‚Äôm very firmly invested in the work that I‚Äôve done, this might be days, but in cases like this (where I‚Äôve received good feedback, and the downside to sharing my reaction is fairly limited), a couple minutes is often enough. I find this most challenging to do in face-to-face settings, which is the reason I tend to solicit feedback primarily in written form (which has mercifully become more acceptable as a result of certain world events). If I don‚Äôt think I can respond to a given piece of feedback in a manner that I would appreciate coming from someone else, that‚Äôs my cue to dig deeper into why I had that reaction.</p>

(checks notes)... every other aspect of your life. It's the sort of thing that primary education ought to teach, but doesn't.</p>
<p>In terms of "the expectation is that criticism would bother you", it is normative to feel prickled by criticism, but the more productive framing is gratitude for an opportunity to improve this thing about which you care so much. There's nothing easy about moving from defensive to open hearted, but it's one of the most worthwhile things you can do.</p>

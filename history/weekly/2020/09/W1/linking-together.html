<p>Don’t read this for the application “Gatemaker”. Read this for a fascinating outsider’s view on the software industry, systems design, and end-user programming.</p>
<p>Here are a few excerpts to whet your appetite (and/or get you upset enough) to embrace the rather long read (highlights mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The focus of the subsequent Software Patterns movement remained within the formal sciences, and so could not interpret CA’s work in the natural and human sciences: the application of human judgment using feeling, the smooth unfolding of natural geometry, and the task of helping people (programmers or users) to become more whole and alive. The criteria for ‘good’ were so different, that everything was misconstrued, from ‘pattern’ to ‘incremental’. Again, they aren’t to blame: &gt; this focus on abstraction, and the dismissal of feeling, and the reality beyond constructed formal systems, is endemic in the computer industry.&gt;  Today, Software Patterns proponents, like most successful computer people, are not even interested in this cavernous disparity.</p>
<p>Interchangeable parts make an adaptive natural structure impossible. Programming environments, including those inspired by patterns, push this ‘parts’ view, which hampers sensitivity and true novelty. &gt; It’s the worldview of the factory-builder, and these tools for mass-production logistics have little regard for people.&gt; </p>
<p>When underlying code is considered different, and more important, the tendency is simply to trash hard-won efforts to improve the user’s experience.&gt;  This happens all the time in the industry, and Google is among those pushing the lunatic idea that we may not need people to create user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a complete divergence from CA’s work, where the underlying structure is in harmony with human interaction. Computing is not ‘somehow different’. It is still a human tool recruited for human purposes, and the principles still apply.</p>
<blockquote><p>But it was hard to get computing folk to focus on the actual human effect of the program. In fact, they saw it, experienced it, momentarily agreed that it was surprising, but soon forgot it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, they simply weren’t equipped to discuss what we’d accomplished. They were not natural scientists, nor activists. &gt; They shared ‘pragmatic’ and fashionable industry viewpoints that make it nearly impossible for anyone to discover anything new or important about people &amp; computers</p>
<blockquote><p>The software patterns literature has no such research initiative. Instead, they focus on objects, properties, types, lists, titles and categories. &gt; It looks like butterfly collecting, with no drive to build a theory with explanatory adequacy. It’s Natural History instead of Natural Science.</p>

<p>The fact that there are three distinct English words "deleting/closing/stopping" suggests to me that users will have no trouble remembering and repeating these different actions.</p>
<p>An abstraction is useful when we want to operate at the level of the abstraction, across different implementations. How often are users going to want to delete a line of text at the same time as close a network connection or stop a process? Very, very rarely imo.</p>

<blockquote><p>When great thinkers think about problems, they start to see patterns. They look at the problem of people sending each other word-processor files, and then they look at the problem of people sending each other spreadsheets, and they realize that there’s a general pattern: sending files. That’s one level of abstraction already. Then they go up one more level: people&nbsp;&gt; send&gt; &nbsp;files, but web browsers also “&gt; send&gt; ” requests for web pages. And when you think about it, calling a method on an object is like sending a message to an object! It’s the same thing again! Those are all&nbsp;&gt; sending&gt; &nbsp;operations, so our clever thinker invents a new, higher, broader abstraction called&nbsp;&gt; messaging&gt; , but now it’s getting&nbsp;&gt; really&nbsp;&gt; vague and nobody really knows what they’re talking about any more. Blah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen. Sometimes smart thinkers just don’t know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don’t actually mean anything at all.</p>

<p>He makes no suggestion that they would. Instead, he talks about using a conceptually similar framework for interacting with the many databases that are maintained by the operating system, which would mean that when one seeks to perform an action they would have less cognitive work to do in order to figure out how to complete their desired task.</p>
<p>This is in spirit similar to how Plan9 improves upon the Unix model by using the file API to interact with various system and non-system services.</p>

<p>I left a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24334069"></a><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24334069">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24334069</a> with a few ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Emphasize synchronization over imperative API calls. Imperative APIs encourage data silos. They are the underlying technical part of the problem that Zapier and ITTT try to solve. See [0] and [1] for some ideas.</li><li>Allow users to submit "agents" rather than "requests." An agent is a small program given extremely limited resources (limited process/memory/runtime budget) that you can safely run on your server. It is a possible answer to many of the standards/protocols that wouldn't exist if frontends were running on the same machines as backends. [2]</li><li>Emphasize composition over integration.

<p>An example of "integration-style" programming that I deal with often, is the Node.js-style <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter"></a><a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter">https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter</a> where there isn't much of a principle in event ordering, concurrency, propogation, scheduling, etc, and the topology of dataflow is more emergent rather than explicitly designed and very hard to debug. It is still possible to compose things that use EventEmitters, but it's just not ergonomic.</p>
<p>The composable counterpart to EventEmitter would be an FRP-style Observables like those in <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview"></a><a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview">https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview</a>. Observables there are just generalizations over functions and get the benefit of functions, such as recursion and explicit scope.</p>

<p>In jQuery, there is a global namespace that is the DOM tree representing the HTML document, and interactivity is peppered on top of individual html elements, like: <code>$('ul').reorderable()</code> (this is supposed to turn all <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> lists into lists that the user can re-order by drag/dropping their items).</p>
<p>But as soon as you need to nest two re-orderable lists, the code becomes quite awkward, especially if one list can create more lists inside itself. It is not impossible, just hacky.</p>
<p>Compare that with React, where a <code>&lt;ReorderableList&gt;</code> is just a component, which are themselves a generalization over functions. Suddenly it becomes easy to write and use nested lists like so: <code>&lt;ReorderableList&gt;...&lt;div&gt;&lt;ReorderableList&gt;...</code>.</p>

<p>It gets me to reflect that I'd have dismissed it 10 years ago, focusing on the superficial complaints and utterly missing the deeper complaint: of a community of astronomers losing something that used to work.</p>

Just as one example, files were named in a conventional way, like <code>FOO.TXT</code>, but with an extra piece of metadata at the end: <code>FOO.TXT;1</code>. Whenever one changed a file it would create a new file with the number at the end incremented: <code>FOO.TXT;2</code>. A directory listing would show all versions. One could open any version by including the version metadata in the filename, and opening a file without a specific version number would just open the most recent version. One could also delete specific versions as desired while keeping other versions around, like a simple revision control mechanism built into the filesystem.</p>
<p>Other things, like fault tolerant clustering, load shedding, disk quotas, and so on, also worked very well. TBF, there are many reasons one might consider the victory of Unix over VMS a worse-is-better thing.</p>
<p>OTOH, the VMS C compiler was terrible (leading me to write hundreds of thousands of lines of VAX Pascal) and the command line language (DCL) lacked the grace of using pipes under Unix.</p>

I think there are a class of technologies for which this is true. It's a case of incremental improvement vs. fundamental new understanding.</p>
<p>The former is much more common because it's "easier to reach in the search space." I think this is another way to state "failure is manifold" from <a href="https://twitter.com/galtenberg">Christopher Galtenberg</a>'s comment.</p>
<p>I don't think all future technology can be predicted this way. There is a class of technological evolution that breaks out of such local optima. Using the nuclear example again, the shift from combustion to "understanding and harnessing of the atom", was such an event.</p>

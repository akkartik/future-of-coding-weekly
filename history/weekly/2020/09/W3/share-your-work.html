I have a feeling these principles could also work as an IDE extension (imagine being able to hide the "code" layer and show only the "comments" layer, or the "documentation" layer). Curious to hear your thoughts, or whether anyone else is working on something similar?</p>

Although this is not a programming tool, it might be useful for everyone who reads a lot of texts and sometimes wants to continue consuming a text while giving rest to one's eyes.</p>
<p>Concerning interface design, the one thing which is somewhat novel (or at least not mainstream): buttons' names on the widget contain keyboard shortcuts themselves (like "Space"), while functional description (like "pause/resume") is at a side. The motivation is to emphasize and encourage using keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse-clicking on buttons. Do you find this approach useful?</p>
<p>I would be happy to hear feedback of any kind. (This is my first software product which is indended for a potentially wide audience.)</p>

<p>I want to present you my new project, <a href="https://adacraft.org/"></a><a href="https://adacraft.org/">https://adacraft.org/</a>! Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.</p>
<p>This project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on "easier programming".</p>
<p>Using Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for "non-experts" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!</p>
<p>So far, I have added some AI extensions and a <a href="https://www.croquet.io/"></a><a href="https://www.croquet.io/">https://www.croquet.io/</a> extension. An AI extension that uses <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"></a><a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/</a> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML/DOM, and, why not, √† la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch "constraints".</p>
<p>And of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! üôè ‚ò∫</p>

<p>I've been thinking about a Scratch extension to make use of speech transcription, and maybe this would be an easier place to land that code than Scratch...?</p>

Can't tell exactly when, but I will work on it in the near future (it needs some clean up + some update of the Scratch code to a more recent version).</p>
<p>Your extension sounds really great! I guess it is easier to make your extension part of adacraft than Scratch. I would be happy to help you on it!</p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[August 18th, 2020 9:28 PM] nmsmith65: I'm slowly convincing myself that the future of programming includes <em>verbalizability</em> (and thus, natural language).</p>
<p>The <em>ubiquity</em> and <em>utility</em> of natural language is well known: almost all of the information we read, write/type, speak and hear every day is communicated via a natural language, not a specially-crafted one. Natural language is our primary means of understanding the world and interacting with other humans, especially in the absence of supplementary tools such as pen-and-paper (e.g. in face-to-face conversation). When was the last time you described a cause-and-effect phenomenon (a story, event, or task instructions) to someone without extensive use of natural language? At best, we use other artifacts (diagrams, formal models) as aids.</p>
<p>Despite the ubiquity and utility of natural language, if one person tries to "speak" a Java/C/JS/Rust program to another person, they have to go through an extremely complicated and lossy translation process from <em>code</em> to <em>words</em>. Based on some of my recent design work (not shared yet), I'm beginning to believe we could actually design programming languages whose "source code" consists <em>solely</em> of <em>terse</em> natural language sentences/structures with <em>very specific</em> syntax restrictions (to deny multiple interpretations / ambiguities). The language would not be accompanied by any supplementary symbols (!@#$%^&amp;amp;]/-&amp;gt;) with domain-specific meaning, since those would inhibit verbalization. Writing code in this language still requires careful deliberation (to develop the logic), but <em>reading</em> and <em>discussing</em> code with full verbalization becomes trivial: no translation is required at all!</p>
<p>Yes, I'm not the first person to think about putting natural language in PLs. Someone might bring up COBOL, HyperTalk, SQL, or similar. I'm not saying verbalizability is "the solution" to programming alone, but along with a well-crafted semantics (information model etc.), it could lead to something extraordinary.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to think further about this, Felienne Hermans &lt;<a href="https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663|discusses">https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663|discusses</a> verbalization/vocalization of PLs as part of a larger talk&gt; (video is timestamped to that bit). Quote: "how does code sound?"</p>
<p>I searched this Slack's <a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/|archives">http://history.futureofcoding.org/|archives</a>, and I was surprised to discover the word "verbalization" has never been used.</p>

May I invite your attention to 3 resources which I think are aligned with these descriptions?</p>
<p>1/ Universal Algebra is the study of these algebraic structures in a general setting. There‚Äôs a really rigorous way in which a unit becomes a list becomes a tree becomes a lattice becomes a (a)cyclic graph. These incidence structures I feel form a rigorous hierarchy by the nature of properties they gain/lose (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity). This alternating (ir)regularity I think continue in other structures like magma, monoid, (quasi/semi)groups, rings, fields. All these take in operators as their signatures and spawn hierarchical (and heterarchical) structures which then gets projected/lifted for various computational purposes. What I find to be severely missing in this field is a visualization of how these abstract algebra structures really look like and this is one of the central things that I‚Äôm working towards.</p>
<p>2/ The ideas I summed up above leads us to topology being a general setting in which these ideas can be given form. I came across this crazy good blogpost a while ago, that extends Harper‚Äôs computational trinitarianism to quadritarianism and beyond: <a href="http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/"></a><a href="http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/">http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/</a></p>
<p>In essence, its a summary of the mathematical correspondences that have been getting unearthed with regards to computational structures. I think the author should turn that into a book with some amazing diagrams and it would really change the game of how programming world sees its connection with algebra/higher mathematics.</p>
<p>3/ Your idea of abstractions of abstractions and recursion as the fundamental idea and tying it up with Chomksy is pretty striking. I‚Äôm out of my depth to exactly point out how, but each level in Chomsky hierarchy I think is realized by reflexive recursion that gives it more degrees of freedom to explore distinct structures. This was my first jibe at it: <a href="https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1304667510101295105"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1304667510101295105">https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1304667510101295105</a></p>
<p>But there‚Äôs also this aspect of mirroring / symmetry that comes out which ties it up with graphs and abstract algebra. This is one place I want to develop my intuitions and Ershov Hierarchy / Turing Jumps are a key part of the puzzle: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_jump"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_jump">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_jump</a> This is one place where I think recursion on recursion is grounded in a mathematical setting on arithmetic hierarchy. It also ties it up to complexity studies. I would also like to add something about Kant‚Äôs philosophy with respect to all of this, but suffice to say that his philosophy helped influence the development of topology and category theory.</p>
<p>Yeah, so bottomline is, if we develop sufficient rune reading powers into mathematics at the moment, I think there‚Äôs a tonne of wealth of knowledge hiding behind all of these. But there‚Äôs also another way to realize these if we start with good fundamentals, explore and reflect. Because all that is being studied there will reflect as problems/leverage points in our own systems of making. Which is why I love and look forward to see how some of the people solve problems here.</p>

<p>kernel is a programming language designed as part of a phd thesis based on reviving f-expressions in a lisp-like language. f-expressions are a expressions where the lists aren‚Äôt evaluated by default, and they can be used to implement a lot of primitives in a simple lisp interpreter. i see it as manipulating code as data more directly than traditional macros do. ‚Äúvau‚Äù is the author‚Äôs terminology for the f-expression version of lambda. <a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html"></a><a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html">https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html</a></p>

<p>f-algebras and recursion schemes are closely related. there are a lot of talks on youtube directed at programmers, but i haven‚Äôt yet felt like i have a 100% grasp on them. here‚Äôs an example talk: <a href="https://youtu.be/JZSoPZUoR58"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/JZSoPZUoR58">https://youtu.be/JZSoPZUoR58</a> . the essential concept is that you can use the structure of a fold and related transformations to kind of backtrack recursive abstract data types into a compact representation. you can take the dual of this (unfold, or a recursive definition of a data type) to create some data, and then perform a fold to interpret that data (i think this is a hylomorphism but i‚Äôm completely unsure). the f-algebra is a way of interpreting down those unfolded structures.</p>

Not sure what NoC is though; I just read that as Nature of Order‚Ä¶</p>
<p>APL the language is for sure interesting too. I read Aaron Hsu‚Äôs thesis and spent days working through some of the compiler code symbol by symbol. That‚Äôs when I first looked more closely into APL. There are some clever things going on, in particular the way scalars, vectors and matrices are handled transparently, and that you basically only have one or two arguments per ‚Äúfunction call‚Äù. That is really what the terseness is about. It‚Äôs easy to just see single-symbol function names and dismiss that as a peculiar design choice and then miss all the interesting stuff (that‚Äôs what I did before).</p>
<p>For me APL however is mostly interesting for defaulting to vector-like structures, which makes it especially suitable for algorithms optimized for parallel execution and GPU compute, and it seems APL practitioners have adapted to mostly take advantage of that style of programming. From a language design perspective or a mathematical perspective I don‚Äôt find it that exciting, but I may very well be overlooking something.</p>

<p>1 Universal Algebra ‚Äî this seems to be what I was hoping for when I started getting into category theory (we even had a study group here). For category theory I concluded that the basics are great to know, and they btw align with Christopher Alexander's intent with pattern languages, which also state that patterns are independent from the actual entities and are completely defined by the relations between them. But as I'm still more interested in applying that knowledge to actual problems, category theory then quickly seems to drift off into abstract math land where it seems more like an entertaining thinking sport for a higher math priesthood.</p>
<p>Anyway, Universal Algebra: I'm familiar with orders, groups, sets, monoids, etc. If I'm specifically interested in the mathematical definition and transformations between lists and trees and lattices, do you have any great introductory pointers to read/watch?</p>
<p>2 Topology ‚Äî I guess I need to brush up on topology. Will read that blog post.</p>
<p>3 Recursion + Chomsky ‚Äî If I understand you correctly, I think you're interpreting what I said already on a more abstract level than I meant it, which is interesting. That's the main problem discussing these things: we talk about abstraction all the time and we do it all the time, but we don't really have a sense for which level of abstraction we're at right now. We can only determine where we are in the hierarchy of abstractions in a relative way, by pointing out what's above or below. There is no stable absolute coordinate system that's granular enough. Feels a lot like category theory.</p>
<p>The way I just recently started to understand Alexander's pattern language, seems even more down-to-earth, pragmatic application of a grammar with certain terminals and non-terminals, which form a hierarchy. The point is that such a language can be described with a finite amount of elements (or patterns, in Alexander's case), but can be combined to construct an infinite amount of resulting artifacts (built structures, in Alexander's case). Through the language we get hierarchy, so there are patterns that apply to different levels of scale (up from patterns for towns, through patterns for houses, to patterns for ornaments). These correspond to where in the syntax tree they are; higher-level (town) non-terminals often rely on several more layers of lower-level (house) non-terminals until you finally resolve to a terminal (~ ornaments?).</p>
<p>So that's all pretty basic generative grammars stuff.</p>
<p>Alexander doesn't like recursion, because there isn't really an infinite sequence anywhere in nature. It all begins and ends somewhere. So it doesn't map perfectly. But I'm willing to consider that an "implementation detail". üôÇ</p>
<p>But I expect more clarity on this from his Nature of Order series, which I will finally attempt to read soon.</p>

But I think I‚Äôm reasonably ready now to slowly work towards absorbing the lessons there. That + MiniKanren by Friedman/Byrd been on my list for a while.</p>
<p>Thank you for the links on Kernel, coming across of it for the first time. Will take a closer look at this one. Yeah, folds and unfolds (Origami programming I think it‚Äôs called? <a href="https://archive.alvb.in/msc/11_infomtpt/papers/origami-programming_Gibbons.pdf"></a><a href="https://archive.alvb.in/msc/11_infomtpt/papers/origami-programming_Gibbons.pdf">https://archive.alvb.in/msc/11_infomtpt/papers/origami-programming_Gibbons.pdf</a>) points at that deep correspondence between Initial/Final (co)algebras that I have been talking about. I think the idea here is that you can modularize everything down to a sequence of unary/binary function and then talk about folding them to get data and unfolding the data to get the sequence back. This I think is a powerful idea and continuations I think are like things that does these sporadically and jumps to another part (like goto) to create a computational structure. Bird/Meerteens/Gibbons seem to be the people who pioneer work in this domain. Their Algorithmics movement I think is a great advancement in this direction. I found this person on Twitter who have been reading papers on these and doing a review of them: <a href="https://twitter.com/chansey97"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/chansey97">https://twitter.com/chansey97</a></p>
<p>Re: Specter/Lenses is another place, though I don‚Äôt know how they related to these structures. But is something I would love to read further. I see Profunctor Optics have slowly turned into a central focus point among theorists.</p>
<p>One of the central things I think in computing and most of mathematics is the idea of duality. So that defunctionalization/refunctionalization as much as I understand is a way to reify a continuation so that it can be treated as a datastructure. If my guess is not far off, what you get is the above mentioned algebra structure which the folds and unfolds work over. The beauty about algebra is that you get a lot of nice properties which yields itself to different ways of instrumenting into the program. Like associativity guarantees that the brackets around operations a(bc)(de) can be moved around giving (ab)(cd)e meaning you can execute each of those functions in any context (any thread when mapped to a computational substrate) and then rejoin the result to get back the original one. Mathematicians go further and generalize that to ideas like Tamari lattice: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice</a> where all such orderings are studied and their properties are investigated. So this bigger perspective of looking at things gives an idea to locate where the dualities arise and then instrument your program accordingly. Writing all that makes me wish there was an interactive space to show how all these things fit together.</p>
<p>Thanks a tonne for your input and I‚Äôll definitely look through them and respond back when I have better clarity on these.</p>

<blockquote><p>We can only determine where we are in the hierarchy of abstractions in a relative way, by pointing out what's above or below. There is no stable absolute coordinate system that's granular enough. Feels a lot like category theory.If I may venture a guess, I think this is where metric spaces and gauge theories come in. Once you have vector spaces to locate a manifold, the idea of measure gives it a way to locate certain points at a certain distance from one another. This is how topology differs from geometry, in that, topology or set elements for that matter, doesn‚Äôt have a notion of distance between them. So you can continuously transform them without losing the ‚Äúresolution detail‚Äù between the points. Having access to a coordinate and then being able to ground these structures gives a way to talk about distance from your point of reference and which way the hierarchy is aligned. This is a stretch but the idea of left and right adjoints I think can be made visual once we have a coordinate access acting as an indexical. Also, as a related idea, if you take a different coordinate axis, you can see your perspective on these changing and the structures being cast in a different manner. Category Theory studies the perspectiveless space and hence opens up to a very general ground for studying these structures.</p>

Mac Lane, (co)inventor of Category Theory has written a book called Mathematics, Form and Function: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Form-Function-Saunders-MacLane/dp/1461293405/"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Form-Function-Saunders-MacLane/dp/1461293405/">https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Form-Function-Saunders-MacLane/dp/1461293405/</a> but I think it needs a decent grounding in at least some mathematical domains before you read it. Its his whirlwind tour though mathematics detailing how each of them relate to one another. Motivation to invent Category Theory can be seen in this work.</p>

<p>There is a way in which trees become lattices. I need to examine the exact mathematical properties that create this transformation, but I think it is when boundaries merge together around a center.

I've been thinking about this myself as well since I am working on a visual tool. Since 25% of users (I heard this number last week in a seminar about this topic, but can't find online docs to support this) of regular websites have some sort of (temporarily)  accessiblity issues, this deserves attention. I can imagine that it should be possible to "tab" through a visual flow following the connections somehow. Keyboard access in general is needed offcourse. And also simply using color combinations with a good enough contrast ratio. But I wonder if a "nodes and wire" visual-model helps people who are blind, even if a screenreader would work properly with such interface. Would this give you a proper mental model of the visual flow? Would a different kind of flow work better? In my day job I have to take accessibility into account (the website/webapp I currently work on has users who are blind for example). But for my own flow-based-programming project I don't take this into account yet (I simply dont have the time and its a project without users anyway currently), but in the future I probablly will take it into account.</p>

I largely came to the conclusion that they do program for themselves, it just takes the form of personal sites and side projects, rather than the type of thing I was looking for), I got a couple of requests for some examples of what I mean, so I decided to start a thread to share customizations.</p>
<p>There are three categories I had in mind when I started that thread:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>Using programming to support software development with things like continuous integration, and automated testing (these are both actually popular, but in my experience programmers tend not to like working on them very much).</p>
</li><li><p>Solving problems programming problems programmatically, e.g., writing shell scripts or using  text editor marcos (<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros"></a><a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros">https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros</a>) to perform a refactor that isn't supported by refactoring tools.</p>
</li><li><p>Writing scripts and customizations to help improve your own personal workflow.</p>
</li></ol><p>I think of those three, only the last one that I think only #3, personal customizations, needs examples to understand, so that's what this thread is about. I'm going to try to share a mix of things that I think would be helpful to any programmer, and things that are very specific to my own workflow.</p>
<p>I'd love for anyone else to share their own customizations. I'd also love to hear of people think these types of customizations would be helpful (or not helpful) for the way they work. (Or also just if my presentation of them isn't clear.) Cheers!</p>

<ul><li>I probably spend 20-&gt;30% of all development time on CI/Deployment/Testing/Cross Platform Builds/CMake.  So scripting Travis and AppVeyor typically.  This is often a tedious burden, but I do it because I think cross platform code is important.  All significant projects should build/work on Linux/Mac/PC as a minimum, and have continuous integration.2/3 I have a batch file called 'j' which is a single character shortcut mechanism:</li></ul><ul><li>j t foo           (find foo in all files recursively using RipGrep, with my favourite pattern of file to search)</li><li>j j                  (open the batch file to add more commands)</li><li>j merge CL   (merge a commit into my P4 working tree - for work stuff)etc.</li></ul><p>I maintain my vimscripts on a regular basis, but that is usually just adding plugins to the editor.  I have several other batch files particularly for things I do on the day job that are tedious.  Usually if I can't remember the syntax of a command on a regular basis I make a macro.  All my scripts live in my dropbox and are accessible from anywhere.  One example of such a script is 'git-squash' which rewrites history and squashes a bunch of commits into a single commit; useful before publishing, since I commit often.  Things like that.....</p>
<p>Zep is an example of building a tool for programming; but it is not at the point where I can use it for general day to day tasks; mostly because it lacks intellisense for C++.</p>

You've been busy. An observation I have is that many of the things you've listed to me would fully qualify as side projects, perhaps even potential businesses (e.g., OCR for VNC). E.g., things that are big enough that I'd want to share them, which definitely has an order of magnitude more cost.</p>
<p>One of the things that I find rewarding about smaller personal scripts and customizations (some of yours are in this category too) is that you can go from having an idea to adding it to your workflow in a single sitting. There's almost no other use of programming that has a fast ROI like that, usually you're writing code that will be used in the distant future, often by someone that isn't youself... Just an observation.</p>

I wonder what the common characteristic for people you compress there workflow into less and less keystrokes like this is. Personally, I'd describe it as "doesn't like doing tedious work", but that feels wrong because that sounds like everyone. I keep coming back to some sort of ever present frustration, like using a computer when it's not customized feels like trying to force Playdough through a straw, I'd be curious if you (or others) have this same feeling and that's what drives you to customize?</p>

But they were not. My only goal with them was to serve myself, and I did them incrementally in between other projects (ok, sometimes procrastinating from grad school research) and called them closed when they were good enough. OCR for VNC happened over a long weekend, though I planned for it in advance. That's the outside limit on how far in the future I was planning for. Everything was incremental, even if I accumulated infrastructure over time and built up on things from years ago.</p>
<p>In fact, this is one of my frustrations with the world we live in: things that look like they could be for others are assumed to be for others and treated on that footing. It's incredibly frustrating to me that Firefox killed the old extensions even for people who were building for themselves. Before the final cut it was frustrating that there was a period of 2 years where Firefox supported old extensions but only if you went through their app store process and got your extension reviewed. Even if you had no intention of providing it to others! This is all kinds of fucked up. Again and again this world starts out building things to be hackable -- and then throws that capability away.</p>
<p>This is why I'm bearish on projects like <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">Geoffrey Litt</a>'s Wildcard. It's just a recipe for losing work on somebody else's schedule. I'll never ever contribute to any sort of plugin or extension economy again. Even if it's open source.</p>

I wonder in thinking about this whether we don't see more of this in the younger generation because many have chosen a particular language ecosystem and it's pretty difficult to manage this sort of thing without being a flexible polyglot programmer. ü§î Also, like <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a>, I would not think to productize any of this stuff, despite the aggregate being of a similar scale to a commercial offering.</p>
<p>In terms of moment-by-moment interactions, I've attached a video of using <code>elisp</code> within the context of search-and-replace to fix some unicode foolishness in an SVG document containing a set of icons. When using emacs this way, one writes code all the time with the intent to use it and then throw it away. This attitude requires trust in one's tools and processes that whatever is being done won't take very long or be very difficult -- that it doesn't involve a "development process" in the methodological sense. Once more I say: do not accept compile-run-debug cycles in your life, make your medium a partner that grants you flow.</p>
<p>Lastly, I thought I'd add something quick I livecoded to help me accomplish a specific task, but that is not a script. I needed to edit some video and found the UIs of most systems to be wretched, so I took a few minutes to build the scrubber I wanted (a series of strips representing sufficient difference between frames to give scene navigation). The workflow allowed both direct manipulation and programmatic interaction from within emacs at the same time.</p>

<p>I think the way jobs are structured has something to do with it. It seems to be you're first programming language you get the most reward (a job), your second a bit more (one complementary language is helpful to your career), your third practically zero. Most programmers I work with focus on one or two languages, but there's a subset who use the most appropriate language for a problem (this is what I try to do). It seems like you first need to be the second type, which is already rare, and then you also need to want to customize. This is probably a big part of why there are so few who do this, two filters like that is a lot.</p>

I do agree. I think my original argument isn't exactly that but it overlaps.</p>
<p>Say you're a circuit designer and see two circuit diagrams for the same circuit. One diagram has squiggly lines, symbols are not clearly represented, multiple symbols are used for the same type of device. Another has a neat layout, parallel lines, few crisscrossing lines, crisp consistent symbols etc. The latter is more "readable". This is good yes. But it thinks of the medium as static paper. If you have a bajillion devices and lines, this level of readability doesn't buy you much. So the focus on readability is a bit off the mark, specially when talking about large scale systems. What can help is if the system can tell you the high level system design first (I think what Kartik is suggesting) or if you can query the system and determine connections (e.g. does component A output lead into component B) and can make the system simulate itself (these are the things I'm talking about)</p>

<p>My first reaction, while I'm still attached to my perspective: it's hard to determine what questions to ask in a complex system without first having a good hierarchical decomposition in your mind.</p>
<p>The lesson of <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk"></a><a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk</a> is that while interaction is important (see everything by Bret Victor after it) it's more important to start from a baseline visualization that requires as little interaction as possible.</p>

A simple example is jump-to-definition style links, which is a query and gets much more valuable as the code size grows. However I think a lot more queryability is possible but it is not something language designers usually consider, compared to, say how "readable" the syntax is. I'd like to see more discussions asking the following during language design/discussion: what kinds of information would the developers want to extract from largeish code bases and how can we make this language/system that answers them effectively.</p>

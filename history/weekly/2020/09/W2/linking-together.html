There is no distinction between working at the repl and editing the source code. I build the program in the file and have an active running repl connected to that file/project. In fact, I can even load up multiple projects in one repl and work on changes across them. So if I have some library I depend on I can load up it's code, edit it, evaluate it, and have those changes reflected live in my program. </p>
<p>I never do any copy and paste. I am working with a live running program and I can do all sorts of things with that. One example is testing out failure modes and simulating in real time systems going down and coming back up, watching how the system handles it. </p>
<p>Another is what I've called interactive integration tests. I have some namespace of code that is meant to be run at the repl. It imports parts of my apps and lets me combine them in various ways to test the live working system, but fully parameterizable. </p>
<p>This flow is the main reason I enjoy programming in clojure so much. I get immediate feedback and a much closer connection to my program.</p>

<p>The opposite I am just typing in the file. I know you mentioned sending them to the repl, that is kind of sort of what is happening. But there isn‚Äôt some separate repl window I am sending text to. I am just typing and evaluating code. The repl is a background process. I can pull it up and type in it directly, or see print statements there. But generally, I just see the results of my evaluation in line, or in a bigger pretty print buffer. Here is little gif of that (with lots of typos)</p>

<p>Once it is in the shape I want, wrap on assert around it and make sure it is where my test runner picks it up. But many times that isn‚Äôt the point of the code. It is for a continually evolving system and I am just trying to understand it more, test the bounds, explore data, etc.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. That is cool. I wouldn't call this a REPL, the REPL is just an implementation detail at this point. But it feels perfectly self-contained and internally consistent without needing a REPL. üëç üëç</p>

<p>I've encountered something similar from the opposite direction. I always found all the architecture astronomy Java programmers got into to be extremely frustrating -- until I started using an IDE and realized that they were using operations that their tooling made much easier than it was for me in Vim.</p>
<p>This is why C++ programmers write longer functions than Java programmers: the C++ grammar is context-sensitive and harder to build an IDE for. Which connects up neatly with another thread this morning, with <strong>@Jason Brennan</strong>: <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1599495354127000?thread_ts=1599070210.092100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1599495354127000?thread_ts=1599070210.092100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1599495354127000?thread_ts=1599070210.092100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL</a></p>

<p>This should seem like pedantic philosophical hairsplitting, but I'm finding it interesting for some reason. The way I see it:</p>
<ul><li><p>Your environment allows showing values of variables anywhere.</p>
</li><li><p>For historical reasons, it does this by using a REPL behind the scenes.</p>
</li><li><p>Since there's a REPL, it exposes it to you that you could use.</p>
</li></ul><p>But as you said, you don't normally use the REPL. That says to me you have something better. There's a spatial component here that sounds awesome. While it's technically correct to call it a read-eval-print-loop, I think that understates the value.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[September 7th, 2020 9:15 AM] ak: &lt;@U01286RNB70&gt; the original thread seems to be about designing languages. I interpret that as about designing textual programming languages. Does prototyping those still have a limitation with text files? (Earlier phases certainly benefit from the ability to draw lines and boxes and so on.)</p>
<p>In general I'm a bit bemused by this thread. As a programmer it all feels quite waterfall-y. If you try to "mock up" a language before giving it a grammar you're quite likely to end up introducing ambiguities that need modifying the language to resolve. Similarly with many other aspects of the activity. If an activity eventually needs to be mapped on non-linear primitives (as computer programs do), it seems to me that it benefits from lots of feedback loops.</p>
<p>Funny story: the original waterfall diagram [1] had feedback loops between phases, so even waterfall <em>practiced right</em> can be quite effective. Of course, that's not what anybody means by the term anymore..</p>

<p>What I actually find more interesting is the fact that actually the editor interface and the repl interface are both just interfaces over the process. What is really happening behind the scenes is some separate server process that is running my code and accepting socket connections and sending output to various places. That behind the scenes process is the real repl going on and everything else is just a view on top of it.</p>

It's a technicality, a detail of implementation. The more fundamental distinction is that between a programming language and a programming system.</p>
<p>In a programming system, there is a system state that includes code and data, and events that update the system state. A particular important type of event is a code update event, but it's just a special case of an instruction sent to the system for updating its internal state. There is no notion of a "program" that you could write, compile, and run. A REPL is a tool to send events to the system, but there can be others, and much better ones, as discussed above. Emacs is such a programming system by itself, and it also become a popular user interface to other Lisp-bases systems such as Common Lisp or Clojure. The other well-known family of programming systems is Smalltalk, which pioneered better-than-REPL interfaces to programming systems.</p>
<p>In contrast, a programming language is designed to write a program, representing a process that runs inside a larger computing system that is considered outside. The process is seen as primarily self-contained, and interaction with the rest of the system is considered exceptional and must be made explicit using relatively cumbersome techniques (I/O, shared memory, etc.).</p>
<p>Both points of view have good and bad points, and what I'd really like to see is a hybrid: a programming system that permits the creation of well-defined subsystems with well-defined interfaces that can be the subject of contracts, type-checking, sandboxing, etc.</p>

That said, I strongly prefer using a language whose syntax facilitates easy structural operations. An example of this in the case of Lisp-family languages is that with syntax like <code>(foo (bar 1) (baz 2))</code> it's trivial to position the cursor after the sub-expression <code>(bar 1)</code> and evaluate just that, allowing one to tease apart a larger piece of code in order to test/understand it. In languages with more complicated syntax that lack clear scope delimiters it's much harder to make a good UX for this.</p>

<ul><li><p>PANE shows everything, but it's less dense. A single value is often printed in multiple places on screen. In Brief there's a designated place for showing runtime values, so less real estate is expended on them.</p>
</li><li><p>Brief shows a stack at the top level, but once definitions are created they get 'reified' into textual definitions. This is nice and dense, but solves just one level of the problem of not making me simulate in my head. I kept waiting for the author to show some way to "drill down" into a defined word to visualize how it constructs its intermediate results, but that still seems to be an open problem. It's also a little klunky that there are two ways visually to represent the same expression, one with boxes and the other in plain text.</p>

In such a language, reifying the stack is a natural debugging affordance because it reveals that hidden mechanism. In concatenative languages, we invert that mental model by centering the stack and mostly pretending that there are no registers/variables. This makes the feeling of the stack very different in, say, FORTH vs Pascal.</p>

<p>The phenomenal thing about this is unifying "actual debugging" with "brain debugging". When you are writing and reading code, moving the cursor, you are naturally "running" it and maintaining the state in your head. This offloads that to the computer.</p>

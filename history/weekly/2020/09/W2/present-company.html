<p>Recently I was thinking about diving deeper in no-code space and maybe building a new tool for learning and maybe making it public. So, I started browsing the web and checking existing product and was overwhelmed by the number of no-code tools exist already.</p>
<p>Maybe I was living in a bubble but I thought it is kinda new space with only pioneers in it.</p>
<p>So now I‚Äôm curios about the state of the field of no-code tools, its spread, adoption and maybe general problems and limitations most of the tools share.</p>
<p>Appreciate any thoughts on the topic üôÇ</p>

But some of the limitations of some nocode tools, first is vendor lock-in and then the fact that at some point there is still need to use some code and in that case it is quite complicated to do so.</p>

I wanted to write about fast typing and keyboard layouts. I thought I'd come out that dvorak/colemak are slightly better than qwerty but possibly offset by some costs. Nope, turns out the bottleneck for speed for many people is RSI. So fast typing is all about a keyboard layout which reduces RSI. This, based on my interviewing of a few people and myself, split + tent matter a lot. Negative tilt helps me, but didn't help other people as much. I tried really hard not to bikeshed about pointless detail in the post to keep it short, but I'm worried it still sounds...incomplete as a result. Almost as if the point of detailed research for a reader is not the research itself but to convince the reader I know what I'm talking about? Don't know. In any case, I think the insight of focusing on RSI is pretty good, even if I'm not an expert in fixing RSI.

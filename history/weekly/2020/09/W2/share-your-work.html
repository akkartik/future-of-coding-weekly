I suppose this is a consequence of the serial nature of text, its an inherently linear medium...</p>

In fact most layer use cases might be like this. I've implemented layers by 'collapsing' instead of hiding - the layer collapses into a single character. Maybe this sets the expectation wrt moving and deletion?</p>

Perhaps the 'transport' or 'delete' option could be a user option.  And perhaps deleting hidden layer content could move that content onto a special 'deleted' layer....</p>

In 2d graphics, each layer is independently grounded to a stable absolute coordinate system. All movement is relative to the absolute coordinate system. (Is this true? I haven't used 2d drawing that much)</p>
<p>In text all we have are relative coordinates. So when moving text chunks, we're not just moving the content, we're also possibly moving the coordinate system - the ground itself is moving. In other words, the principle 'hidden layers should not be affected' seems to be on shaky ground.</p>

Selections have to know what layers they contain and maybe which they skip, and make it clear to the user. If you're writing a long text, different use cases will call for including the outline layer or just the "final text" layer in a copy-paste.</p>
<p>Idea 1: only show placeholders for layers when they are in or next to a selection/the cursor. Idea 2: part of the UI display of a selection is a layer-selector similar to the one for the whole document, so you can choose to exclude layers within the range defined by the selection (at which point it starts acting like a multi-selection.)</p>

Introducing different layers means at least introducing some form of hierarchy that breaks all the simple algorithms that work well with ranges in sequences.</p>
<p>Cutting a range out of a linear sequence only makes sense if the sequence is the ultimate truth — but then you can’t model different layers with it. Adding layers means you fundamentally change the core data model from something as simple as a sequence to something more complex like a tree or worse.</p>
<p>But that’s a great direction to think in. We need to figure that out for structural editing too.</p>

I think there have been a couple conflicting models discussed here, but that one is pretty flat AFAICT. I think it's basically a sequence of (layer_tag, text).</p>
<p>As long as all the layers need to be contiguous but non-overlapping, i.e. perfectly cover the range [0,n), then the linear sequence with layer metadata is an equally valid ultimate truth (in a certain sense anyway?) to a sequence of layer segments. I don't necessarily want to get bogged down in the representation of a selection, but I think an index range is not crazy. Algorithms on pointers into this structure are going to be tricky regardless.</p>

My comment was meant conceptually, not talking about implementation. There are many different ways to implement it, and it doesn't have to end up in an actual tree data structure, but conceptually it seems to me that there is a line that's crossed when you need to deal with overlapping ranges where you cross over into a different complexity class.</p>
<p>If I'd be better at math, I'd probably be able to explain that better with algebraic structures and the operations defined on them. I think it has to do with the total order requirement on the character sequence, which makes ranges work, but then as soon as you start handling ranges as their own entities with their own operations defined on them, you are introducing another… hmm… layer that has different requirements. And that's what I mean by hierarchy — layers are above the sequence conceptually and allow certain operations, doesn't matter how you implement them.</p>
<p>Ah, well, that probably doesn't help, sorry. I wish I could explain it better. Right now it just feels to me that there are some use cases, like cut &amp; paste of arbitrary ranges which don't correspond exactly to layer range boundaries, that can't be represented unambiguously with a pure linear sequence + a set of ranges into that sequence. It could probably be worked around though with some heuristics that'll translate the edge cases into weird/unintuitive behavior from the user's perspective, and perhaps that's totally acceptable.</p>
<p>But I'd love to be proven wrong and maybe there's a better way! This would solve one of my current problems too…</p>

It travels with the character where ever it goes. So editing as usual just moves the characters around. Contiguous is more of an incidental feature - many consecutive characters have the same layer. As an optimization, you can only store entire spans as Andrew suggested above. The only new features, which are outside of editing the text, are 'attach layer to character (or span.. as optimization)' and 'show/hide layer'.</p>

<p>I want to present you my new project, <a href="https://adacraft.org/"></a><a href="https://adacraft.org/">https://adacraft.org/</a>! Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.</p>
<p>This project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on "easier programming".</p>
<p>Using Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for "non-experts" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!</p>
<p>So far, I have added some AI extensions and a <a href="https://www.croquet.io/"></a><a href="https://www.croquet.io/">https://www.croquet.io/</a> extension. An AI extension that uses <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"></a><a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/</a> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML/DOM, and, why not, à la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch "constraints".</p>
<p>And of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! 🙏 ☺</p>

But ScratchX is based on the "old" flash implementation while Scratch 3 is a pure HTML/JavaScript/CSS which I know better.</p>
<p>And why not Blockly? Well I thought of using Blockly, particularly because you can design any block programming system with it, which opens more possible experiments than with Scratch. But for now I wanted to have a complete environment set up quickly, Scratch is usable now for project useful to users. With Blockly, you have to implement lots of things.</p>

I totally agree!</p>
<p>I think one of the UX "regressions" from Scratch 2 with the new Scratch 3 design, is less readable block texts. And I find that the new shapes, even if more eye candy, add too much visual clutter. The same with the colors.</p>
<p>I am very tempted to try to change all this with adacraft. I.e dark text on light block background, remove unnecessary part of shapes (like the small "slots") or make them less present. Though I don't know how difficult it will be to change all that...</p>

<p>I'm also not sure how I feel about ML being such a black box. It feels like all the interesting stuff is hidden away. This risks falling into the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p>And, on the contrary, I find that bringing people to create their own image classification models with Teachable Machine and making them use it from adacraft (or any Scratch with AI extension, there are others) helps them figure out what ML means, and particularly in terms of bias. I have done it several times since one year during workshops and it is very demonstrative.</p>

<p>And I can't wait to create blocks for all the <a href="https://ml5js.org/"></a><a href="https://ml5js.org/">https://ml5js.org/</a> library. With this, there will be really interesting new creative possibilities. Adding blocks based the PoseNet, FaceAPI and other interactive stuff will open to new tangible experiments.</p>

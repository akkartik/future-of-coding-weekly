My post last night on <strong>#two-minute-week</strong> (<a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1600587602007800"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1600587602007800">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1600587602007800</a>) triggered enough unexpected thinking together to get me to write up my recent attempts and try to trigger more.</p>
<p>We all simulate programs in our heads. The activity seems to break down into two major use cases:</p>
<ul><li><p>Forward path: Extracting functions out of arbitrary computations.</p>
</li><li><p>Backward path: Imagining the execution of arbitrary computations containing function calls.</p>
</li></ul><p>The forward path fits very well with ideas like starting with concrete examples and emphasizing data at all times. Nobody should ever have to start with a function definition. Instead, start with an example computation like: <code>18 * 9/5 + 32</code>, and incrementally end up at a function like <code>celsius-to-fahrenheit</code>. The backward path fits with various metaphors for debugging programs. Debug by print, debug by step, time-travel debugging. A key concern is how to uncoil static computations (loops, recursion) into dynamic metaphors (traces, stack frames, interactive movements).</p>
<p>Postfix expressions fit beautifully with the backward path. As the demo of Brief (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3MNcA2dpts</a>) showed, execution is already quite uncoiled, with no backward jumps. While the Brief demo didn't show it (it's easy to spot where the presenter plays computer in their heads), it's reasonable to imagine a way to drill down into function calls, replacing words with their definitions. By contrast, conventional expressions -- tree-shaped and using names -- immediately throw up impediments in understanding what happens first.</p>
<p>However, the forward path is thornier:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>It's common to claim that point-free programs make it easy to factor out new definitions, but that's only true when the definition consists of consecutive words. Consider how you would go from <code>* 3 3</code> to a definition of <code>square</code>, or from <code>3 4 + 5 *</code> to a definition of <code>(a+b)*c</code>.</p>
</li><li><p>After they're extracted, point-free functions are harder to understand. What does the stack need to look like at the start? How many words, what types, how many words consumed, all these questions require simulating programs in your head. Or a manual comment.</p>
</li></ol><p>This was the idea maze in my head until I saw LoGlo (<a href="https://loglo.app/2020-06-16"></a><a href="https://loglo.app/2020-06-16">https://loglo.app/2020-06-16</a>). The cool idea here has taken me weeks to articulate: lines have names and get separate stacks. Forth typically writes to names within lines with words like <code>!</code>. Limiting definitions to one per line strikes me as an advance. And having names gives us a way to make Forth words less point-free. I start imagining flows like turning <code>* 3 3</code> into <code>* x x</code> using two 'rename' operations, and then turning the entire line into a new function. Like, imagine a UI with a code side on the left, and a scratch computation on the right:</p>
<pre><code>              ‚îÇ

              ‚îÇ  x: 3

              ‚îÇ  * x x

              ‚îÇ</code></pre><p>After defining a function it might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>              ‚îÇ

   : sq x     ‚îÇ  sq 3

        * x x ‚îÇ

              ‚îÇ</code></pre><p>Notice how the definition of <code>x:</code> above gets replaced by the call to <code>sq</code> below. That's kinda pleasing.</p>
<p>But there's issues. This manipulation requires modifying definitions of free variables. Worse, I ended up with the function call in prefix order. Trying to make things consistent got me stuck up on a tree with a 2D layout until I noticed I'd lost the benefits of postfix that got me on this road in the first place. I'll include it here just in case it sparks ideas for others, but I'm starting to think it's a dead end.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's where I am, still looking for a representation that's easy to uncoil and where inlining function calls is a 'smooth' visualization.</p>

<p>xy lets every program have both a stack (representing‚Ä¶ the stack) and a queue (representing the stream of tokens that are the rest of the program).

It shows 2 ways to imagine inlining. In option A we have a standard Forth, and inlining replaces words with their definitions. The stack stays the same, it just gets more intermediate steps.</p>
<p>In option B we still have a stack, but execution state also includes a namespace of values for (immutable?) variables. For example, adding <code>:x</code> to a line saves the top of the stack as the value of <code>x</code>. Every line starts with an empty stack, but can share data with previous lines via variables.</p>
<p>Now inlining shows a second stack in its own row. We might even want to expand the stack of the caller to fit the callee in, just one 'row' down to show that it's an independent, isolated stack. (The <code>x</code> in <code>sq</code> is unrelated to the <code>x</code> in the caller since each function has its own namespace.)</p>
<p>I think both are equally uncoiled. The big benefit of option B to me is that the accidental complexity of stack manipulation (<code>swap</code> and <code>dup</code>) has been eliminated.</p>

<p>i‚Äôm not opposed to variables but i do think that B is more coiled‚Äîthere‚Äôs shadowing in the example, which is hard for beginners (and sometimes annoying for experts), and you did draw a coil with your arrows to the inline function üòâ. </p>
<p>id argue that B is more readable/comprehensible but also more coiled. at the very least, it would be harder to communicate visually where exactly x and y are coming from with the same clean and regular table view as you were using before. and the definition of anything using x or y now depends on your environment which means it can‚Äôt be factored seamlessly anymore</p>
<p>factor, joy, and other modern concatenatives use quotations and combinators to get around a lot of the shuffling, but combinators IMO are just as bad (the canonical example is called ‚Äúbi‚Äù, and i can never remember whether it expects two quotes on top of the stack and applies each to the next two items respectively, returning them in order, or some other permutation. even trying to describe my misunderstanding in words is hard). </p>
<p>i definitely don‚Äôt have any immediate solutions yet but the comma product article i posted is one attempt, i think pattern matching on the stack itself could be another, and (weirdly) thinking of variables as like almost vim macros that replace with values in-place could be a third direction (like some shells let you expand, eg, how <code>rm *.txt</code> <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> can expand the text at your prompt <code>rm hello.txt readme.txt getting_started.txt</code> in a directory containing all those files) i think i have about 8 total options for this but my notecards aren‚Äôt with me and those are the ones i both know of and can remember off the top of my head</p>

<p>One thing I want to point out: the shadowing you mentioned is essential to this idea. Basically I rely on shadowing to avoid making decisions about variable names. However, once a function is defined it can now be invoked with entirely different names.</p>

I always enjoy stack manipulation puzzles. This isn't about fixing something broken in Forth, but about seeing what part of Forth I can take with me to spreadsheets and example-oriented programming.</p>
<p>I'm probably still failing to internalize the previous discussion at <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1599496562080600"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1599496562080600">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1599496562080600</a>, so this would be a great place for a rebuttal-by-screencast. Assume you've already run <code>(* 13 13)</code> (or its Forth equivalent) at your favorite REPL. How do you get from that expression to a definition of the function <code>square</code> in persistent form?</p>
<p>The assumption I'm making is that nobody calculates the square of 13 at the REPL by typing <code>13 dup *</code>. So it seems to me that we need some way to nudge people to massage <code>13 13 *</code> into a form that needs a single copy of the input(s).</p>
<p>It's just a thought experiment in the end. It's a frame of reference I'm taking on for the duration, and in the process I'm working against some of my own discomfort with spreadsheets and other 2D representations.</p>

<p>I guess my bigger qualm is that catenative programs tend to feel less catenative and more conventually referential as they get larger.  How can one keep the catenative spirit in bigger programs?</p>
<p>Maybe some kind of dynamic scope?  Instead of one stack, each dynamic variable names the top of a stack.</p>

A lot of times this document has the code changes required by any of the solution options.
To me the options that we didn't end up following seem as valuable as the chosen option, and those options should also be captured in code. A really easy way could be in separate branches, but then we loose visibility of them.
Is anybody familiar with source control software or with patterns to work with source control that also keeps tracks of options considered but not followed at the end?</p>

My own personal programming project is aimed to help with this. But I've also been white boarding through ideas on how to help with this in the current world. Not sure I could summarize well the ways I want to actually help this problem here, but I do want to at least contribute a few meta thoughts.</p>
<p>First I think one really important thing to consider is if we can in fact recover the important parts of a programs history at all. Peter Naur in his paper "Programming as Theory Building" claims that re-establishing the theory of a dead program is strictly impossible. I'm sure so people might question this, but I think this is actually very important to consider. If we aim at trying to save a history, we have to consider our aims. If our goal is to recover the theory behind the program that could be a fools errand. Instead maybe we should be thinking about what parts of a programs history are important for helping us establish a new theory? Does that history have to be an actual history or could it be something like what is proposed in the talk "Idealized Commit Logs" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ</a>)?</p>
<p>Second I think we actually should really consider learning more from historians, particular historians of artifacts (like art history). There is a great book on art history methodology called Patterns of Intention by Michael Baxandall. One of the points he makes is that when we are describing art, we are converting something visual to something linguistic. This is a lossy and biased format, one easy example he gives us that paintings don't actually a beginning and end point. We have to choose how to describe it and where to start. When we are studying art works, we are really studying them under some description of them. (He makes this much clearer for of us who are not artistically inclined by starting with a history of the forth bridge. His history of this artifacts asks as a really interesting example into what goes into an historical explanation.)</p>
<p>I think these same things hold true for programs. In capturing a history, we can't just be recording facts in a database, we are interpreting those facts, selecting the relevant ones and determining an order. What sorts of facts, in what sorts of orders can help people gain a new theory? Will different interpretations click better with different people? What things do we exclude by selecting that facts in this way? Is the loss worth the pay off?</p>
<blockquote><p>What are some ways in which programming environments could help us record this info / answer these questions without requiring additional effort from the author?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is particularly interesting. We all know that getting people to provide documentation is hard. It is even harder to make that documentation good. Short of completely automatic though, what if we could make this easier? What if we could make it more part of your current flow? What if you didn't have to leave your editor, but you also didn't have to mess up the code by leaving some big huge long comment in the middle of things?</p>
<p>What if you could decide that something was a good example for later and save it off with a single button press? What if you could make tours through your code bases, or document in those code bases various ways the data flows? What if you could make an interactive introduction to codebase.</p>
<p>I think these are the sorts of starting points we should consider. Once we can make these things work and work well manually, then we can start plugging in automations, start making automatic curation.</p>

But only so much free time to do it. </p>
<p>Basically the idea is to base the semantics on term rewriting. So the whole language is just data transformation. Then you can have a notion of meta-execution which is rules that match on the execution data. So you can write a rule that just says, tell me the current expression, what it transforms into, and which rule and clause matched that caused that transformation. </p>
<p>In my prototypes that means I can make a stepping debugger in 3-5 lines of code. And then a time travel debugger in only a few more. Should soon be able to do what we are talking about above as well. </p>
<p>Basically in order to program without a blindfold we need access to the unfolding of the execution of our programs, so why not let it be data that we can match on, query on, etc?</p>

Very well done, and it takes me back, because my PhD thesis involved program dependence graphs and constructing tiny slices out of very large programs that computed precisely the hard-to-cache memory accesses so that they could be prefetched on a separate thread (computer, actually).</p>
<p>Slices certainly have lots of applications, but there's a reason why there's no empirical evidence that they're valuable for comprehension: they aren't actually the most elegant ordering as he claims. The reason: data transformations. Halfway through the evolution of a program someone redid all the data structures to organize by one axis rather than another. Slices get killed there. In general, slices focus on code but the compiler techniques we have (as of 12 years ago) are forced to approximate data access. This loop accesses field <code>x</code> in some node of this linked list, so let's assume it accesses it in all nodes. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific idea he proposes: it doesn't actually result in a very idealized commit log, because a) you still have to provide a heuristic test sequence, and that's non-trivial, b) lots of times you get a more comprehensible result if you combine sets of tests in a single 'idealized commit' (but that blows up your search space for a) even more), and -- most important! -- c) no program has complete test coverage. If you focus only on tests you lose valuable insight along the way.</p>
<p>Me, after spending 8 years trying to treat programs as black boxes and apply tools to them, I go back to the thing he dismissed at the start. There's no way to understand programs efficiently when the author didn't design for it from the start. If a program had multiple authors, it's as easy to read as the author least interested in comprehensibility made it. Programs have to be designed for comprehensibility. So toss out the modern social organization and its incentives for creating programs primarily as black boxes for people to use.</p>
<p>(I'll share my approach to idealized commit logs for the umpteenth time, just in case somebody hasn't already seen it: <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://pel-daniel.github.io/cv/">Daniel Garcia</a> I don't recall the context at work where it came up, but I'm increasingly noticing myself constructing larger refactorings out of what my Java IDE provides, like renaming variables. I renamed a variable here, another variable there, did a few other things, and the end result was that I split up a class that handled some input space into two classes that partition the space between themselves. It would be nice (in a first world problems sort of way) if that was obvious in the diff. This isn't a strong opinion, just a random idea.</p>

My requirements are for storing code points to capture serendipity.  In my tool, I have the beginnings of a system which stores code deltas in the project while live coding.  I want to enable users to capture that moment when a visual effect or sequence of sound is great and rewind to that point afterwards (i.e. when not on stage giving the actual performance).  This is easier in a live coding environment because things are more constrained in a single session/tool.  Good live coders often experience that moment where they are in the zone, and a perfect combination of audio/visual has occurred, but then it is lost forever behind the complex edits they used to get to that point.</p>

Also because it‚Äôs dynamic, there‚Äôs no need for conservative approximations.</p>
<p>I agree that the heuristic ordering of tests is problematic. Another alternative might be to think more statistically. Think about each test as a document and each line of code invoked as a term. Then a test‚Äôs focus would be the lines of code with the highest TF-IDF score (i.e. lines that occur in the test that happen less frequently in other tests).</p>

My only reaction though is that it comes back to how well the unit tests are witten, as noted above. It‚Äôs probably unrealistic to expect tests to cover even half the code base in most projects.  I think I still like the idea of a complete record of every program edit with a scrubber. Perhaps highlighting the code lines that are still in the TOT version, and showing heat maps for areas that are changed often, etc. Perhaps I could deep dive into a region of code and see how it evolved; with optional hiding of low code coverage areas...</p>

They are more lightweight, less focused on the implementation details and more on the reasoning behind the decision.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's just a problem statement, the context (current state of the code and organization), driving factors, analysis of options (pros and cons), the decision, and the consequences.</p>
<p>I use ADRs for larger-scale decisions with multiple stakeholders and conflicting priorities.</p>
<p>One thing I find useful is that ADRs capture the current organizational context which is ephemeral and is never recorded otherwise. Examples might be (1) one team is overloaded while another one is idle, so we might lean to the solution that utilizes their expertise, (2) the other team in the organization is developing a similar solution, so we might piggyback on that program, but that adds an additional dependency on the other division, and we know they are slow to react.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading, they're quite simple, mostly me recording my experience and experimentation. </p>
<p>I'll gradually add more "deep" PL and data science topics as time goes on.</p>

I think it's a function of how Pharo combines code from various sources into one super-environment, especially without the relative safety provided by static type and version checking.  Direct updates to the system classes are another issue.</p>
<p>Base Pharo simply has 'too much junk in its trunk' to ever be reliable.  The Date class, for example, has an easter function that, IIRC, returns the day Easter falls on in any given year.</p>

That's a good way to create a personal knowledge base and that's what most people did. I looked around at that time, but there were little alternatives that offered these features (or they weren't widely known).</p>
<p>I know they have 3rd-party plugins now and people do some interesting stuff with them. That's another reason I see Roam mentioned here.</p>
<p>Also, Roam used to be free until this summer.</p>
<p>Roam introduced me to Zettelkasten which is a great method for maintaining a knowledge base.</p>
<p>So if you want a knowledge base, my recommendation for most people is to learn Zettelkasten (How to Take Smart Notes by S√∂nke Ahrens is a great book) then pick a simple markdown editor with links (zettlr or obsidian.md seem to be good. if you're into Emacs, use org+org-roam). i.e. you don't need roam for that.</p>

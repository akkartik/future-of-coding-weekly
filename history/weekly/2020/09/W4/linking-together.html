Without necessarily doing a deep dive in their docs, could you talk about what makes its API good?</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-09-23T22:42:54.006Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Roben Kleene</span> <a href="#2020-09-23T22:42:54.006Z" class="date">2020-09-23 22:42:54</a> <div class="message"><p>I actually don't think the API matters, just which language it's written in. E.g., what's "right" about VS Code is simply that extensions are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the "proof" of that is simply all the extensions that have been written for it, especially relative to previous approaches. (And the point is doubly illustrated by Atom's initial explosion of extensions, with a completely different API.)</p>
<p>I'd be happy to hear some evidence that the design of the API itself is important. I can think of examples that illustrate it's not important (VimScript as an example of successful poorly designed API, NeXTSTEP/AppKit as a well-designed API not being as successful as it should have been) but I can't think of any that illustrate that it is important. Generally my opinion is that what matters is platform momentum, and developers will support the platform regardless of the design of the API, as long as it can do what they need it to. (There's a bit of a contradiction here, in that the language choice could be considered part of the API, I have to think more about that, but I think the answer has something to do with the "special" nature of HTML/CSS/JS as the browser languages.)</p>
<p>One random side note: I do actually think VS Code has a weakness right now, and that's that it can't run in integrated browser. Historically that's been a tough feature to capitalize on though.</p>

I honestly couldn't even say whether VS Code's API is well designed because I don't even know what it's design is. Atom has a beautiful API, communicated effectively through documentation (I appreciated their design and philosophy around lazy loading for example). I've now spent more time with VS Code than I ever had with Atom, but since documentation doesn't really communicate it, I don't feel like I even understand what philosophy or organizational principles of their extension system are. If I were to characterize VS Code's design approach it would be: Scale solves all problems (a play on "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"). E.g., just ship something and let people bicker it out in GitHub issues and eventually we'll arrive at a working design. And so far there been right! And I actually think the approach is brilliant, because it's future proof. Bad decisions now, get corrected over time, because correcting bad decisions literally is their process.</p>

<p>Installing extensions went from manual (TextMate/Emacs/Vim) -&gt; to third-party, centralized, but CLI style UI (Sublime Text's Package Control) -&gt; to integrated "App Store"-style extension installing experiences (Atom/VS Code)</p>
<p>Extension capabilities went from almost no ways to customize UI (TextMate, and VIM/Emacs for anything non-textual) to customizing the UI through a custom API (Sublime Text) to customizing the UI in a standardized way with HTML/CSS/JS (Atom/VS Code).</p>
<p>Those are the progressions I don't see anywhere else they can go, i.e., installing extensions can't get any easier, and customizing UI can't get any easier.</p>
<p>I think you're primarily asking about other parts of the API? But I'm not sure these APIs have had major limitations in other ways besides in customizing UI and installing extensions. The most notable example I can think of is async process management being added to Vim/NeoVim. For the most part there just aren't other limitations, unless I'm missing them?</p>

The way I wrote the piece was to draw on my observations watching conversations around people switching from TextMate to Sublime Text to Atom to VS Code, and reading people describing in their own words why they switching. And the overwhelming answer for Atom to VS Code isn't LSP or debugging, but it's because Atom was slow. (Note I'm leaving out the role extensions here because Atom and VS Code both have first-class extension support, whereas LSP is definitely a VS Code vs. Atom distinction.)</p>
<p>This isn't to say a lot of people don't also list debugging and LSP, but it was (and still is) dwarfed by performance discussions, and my goal was to have the article based as much as possible on what people are saying, not what I personally think is important.</p>

<p>You can see the impacts of this model in action by looking at the hacky live browser plugin for VS Code that spins up a server just to get automatic refreshing for HTML files. But the bigger impact is the sophisticated dev tools bundled into browsers. It would make so much more sense for those tools to be bundle with the actual source files, so there‚Äôs more seamless interaction between the two. For example jumping to editing the source HTML or CSS, or clicking in the IDE to add debugger breakpoints. There are some hacks to get around this, but they‚Äôre just that, hacks.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons to use a simple webserver (which like 3 lines of code in node). If they used the files system then any 3rd party script loaded over the net would have access to their hard drive. Loading from the filesystem in a browser is just not something you should do. Further, many browser features are restricted to https only. And finally, often you want to run via some staging server because the simple case where everything can run from local files would be an exception for most actual usage.</p>
<p>As for bundling debugging tools into your own code, how does that have anything to do with VSC? If you want debugging tools compiled into your code you add them to your code no? For example if you want <a href="[https://spector.babylonjs.com/](https://spector.babylonjs.com/)">spector.js</a> added to your code then you add it to your code. (yes, it's presented as an extension on that page but if you read the docs you can just as easily use it as a library in your code without having an extension)</p>

I'm using this opportunity to rant. Maybe this should go under that original thread on REPL's, or maybe it's own post, but I'll post it here to start. Apologies in advance üòõ .</p>
<p>For some context, I am not a "lisp person." That's not to say I dislike lisp. I greatly admire lisp....from afar. But, my career and personal interests always end up taking me in a different direction, but I digress...</p>
<p>My day job consists of optimized C++ and Python infrastructure used in the banking industry. It's very "traditional" in many ways. Recently, I "jury-rigged" a series of exploratory "REPL like" programs to test various subsystems. These "REPLs" can be infuriating to set up. No part of the environment is optimized for that kind of workflow.</p>
<p>But I have found that once set up, I was able to be enormously more productive and confident in my code. Compared to any lisp REPL, or even a python REPL, these programs are stone age primitive. Still, this made me want to explore expanding it to more parts of the system, but further I looked, the more difficult it is to setup. I have to make a cost/benefit trade-off against "getting real work done," and unfortunately, I often have to choose to stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>Before I shifted into lower level systems programming, I spent years doing to Javascript and PHP. I burned out on web programming, but this experience made me realize that one thing I miss is the exploratory coding and rapid feedback experience.</p>
<p>And that leads me to the crux of my lament. Why can't I have a systems level programming environment that allows for this kind of rapid feedback?</p>
<p>Obviously there are limits the closer you get to the hardware, but even then, Forth has been used in embedded for decades (with a REPL), and people have put a Python REPL on an ESP8266, so I know it's possible to go fairly far with this idea...</p>
<p>Again, I am not a lisp evangelical, In fact, I generally prefer static types and fine grained control over my memory management. I'm also not saying REPLs are a panacea. I'm a practical person. It's frustrating for me to see the potential for a particular tool, and yet, to be unable to use it. /rant</p>

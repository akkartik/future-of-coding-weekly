And although they call it a codebase, it stores some data as well (everything that has a global name associated with it). It's not quite an image, in particular because it doesn't store the run-time state. You can't "save a session" and take it up again. But it has none of the order-related issues because everything is immutable, except for the names.</p>

From the start people must have this in mind, especially when designing/building things. As engineer, we often are more focusing on bringing more and more "help", which brings it loads of friction too if we don't take care.</p>
<p>Maybe, it would be better if designers/engineers are focusing on lowering friction before adding any helping feature.</p>
<p>I plead guilty on this...</p>

<p>instead what we got was computers as curiosity disablers. weird bureaucracy contraptions that have let people like aetna and uber and facebook design increasingly arcane, complicated, and secret rules for their customers, employees, and users (respectively) to follow, in order for them to deliver further incentives so obscure that they might as well be random (perhaps this is intentional as it makes the a/b test ‚Äúmore scientific‚Äù) across a population of people being basically factory farmed for their output based on the barest and least qualitatively sophisticated metrics imaginable. </p>
<p>if you happen to live inside one of these systems (the hallmark of this is a weird circumstance that you‚Äôve been forced or tricked into: do you want medical treatment? do you want to make a bunch of money with flexible hours? do you want to know what your friends are thinking about?) your experience is specifically determined by an inability to change or have control over any aspect of the experience. that would be detrimental‚Äîevery one of these companies‚Äô business models depends on its ability to change behavior (don‚Äôt go to this doctor; give up on your claim; be at this corner in three minutes; buy this‚ÄîI mean, here‚Äôs someone you should be friends with who happens to be skinnier than you and post about this great supplement). </p>
<p>If you can change your experience, you can use the tool in a different way, and it‚Äôs harder to get you to comply with the needs of the company. Instead, apps like this reward behaving as expected, but more importantly punish deviation‚Äîyou don‚Äôt get a reward, you lose track of where you were, you get returned to the start of the process and lose your place etc. punishing deviation punishes curiosity. &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<p>i know a common and solid, (or to talk like <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a>, steelman) criticism of a language like APL is that it‚Äôs great as long as your problem can be elegantly posed as array manipulation. this talk (to be glib) is about how an enormous amount of production c++ code can be reduced to a few library functions (primarily rotate lol). it‚Äôs making me think we shouldn‚Äôt necessarily evaluate programming languages or libraries by how flexibly they admit extremely divergent domain languages on the immediate syntax level‚Äîmaybe there‚Äôs a test for a language or library‚Äô whose semantics are comfortable with abstracting (with very precise slices or joinery) domain-specific stuff back into the language‚Äôs native functions and data types with minimal effort. </p>
<p>feels like an old timey hacker news take but i mean it in a new light, where rather than insisting that everyone‚Äôs framework should actually be written in lisp, or c, there may be some abstractions that you can build a language around that map to most of the stuff that people do in the 21st century. something appealingly physical about rotate to me. maybe that‚Äôs why i‚Äôve been so into apl (for collections) rebol (for scoping) and forth (for ordering) lately. sorry if basically a diary entry isn‚Äôt appropriate for slack. i don‚Äôt really know how i‚Äôd turn this thought into a blog post lmao</p>

There's a bit of an irony because I should also automate cross posting, but zapier doesn't support substack cross posting :/. Another reason to look for another more code friendly blogging platform. The other big thing I've noticed is that my posts about a specific software tool do much better than ideas about general techniques. So if something says "vi" or "bash" in the title, it does well. I love tools, so I have no problem writing more tutorials on productive ways to use tools like vi and sed.

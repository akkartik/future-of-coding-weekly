<blockquote><p>There a another slack community called “no code founders” that this would be a great fit for feedback from. Several platforms have tried similar approaches.
Thanks for the tip, I’ll check it out. However, the plan for the project is not to be a startup. The project is a research project to explore new approaches to building applications. The tool is open-source (MIT license) and I have no plans to develop it commercially.</p>
<p>I’ve done similar POC work to this, and seen it become equivalent to imperative coding but with one extra layer of indirection
Could you share some links? I’d love to check it out. I should clarify that this is not a UI over standard coding. We created a new type of software module and a new way to put full-stack modules together declaratively. There are more details on the linked paper.</p>

<p>Perhaps sharing the demo video with the graphical environment was a mistake because people just think “oh this is another <a href="http://bubble.io">bubble.io</a>”, but it’s not. The goal is not to build a graphical environment on top of traditional programming, the goal is to build a new style of programming. We just build the graphical environment for people that might not want to use our HTML extension language and to help build apps faster.</p>

&gt; The data schema is important; your thingie is not user-friendly unless users can see data and schema more directly - and do things with it, such as rearrange it to correct mistakes in the schema and data.
&gt; Earlier I remember seeing a really nice spreadsheet-like editor for databases, I think it’s on this slack somewhere. It wasn’t super pretty (because it’s designed to look like a boring old spreadsheet) but it supported all of SQL-92 + extras entirely in a visual manner. Users didn’t have to construct a user interface, they could just deal with the data (and views and calculated columns) directly. A thing like this for constructing user interfaces could be a great value-add&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;something like that.
In our project we assume concepts (our modules) are given and we focused our efforts on figuring out a way to compose concepts together easily.  In our current prototype you implement concepts using standard web programming tools (TypeScript, GraphQL, etc)---we didn’t try to innovate there. I agree that something like what you suggest (a spreadsheet-like editor for databases) would be a good way for people to build concepts, which can then be composed with other concepts in our tool.</p>

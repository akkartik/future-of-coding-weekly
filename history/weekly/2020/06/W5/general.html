How would you use a 2d one? Would you still have to read it one line at a time, or is it reasonable to expect people to consume more than one line at once?</p>
</div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-22T15:22:07.402Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Edward de Jong</span> <a href="#2020-06-22T15:22:07.402Z" class="date">2020-06-22 15:22:07</a> <div class="message"><p>One of the most interesting aspects of braille is that traditionally for example when translating a magazine like playboy was they would hire Artists to make tactile versions of the Cartoons, In this way people could feel a piece of art. You can imagine some software that automatically generates a tactile version of an image, but you have to have a grid of Bumps that can be individually addressed. Outside of the lab there aren‚Äôt any two dimensional bump grid systems, most braille readers are only one row because it costs too much to make a 2d one. Braille faded away once the reading machine from Kurzweil came out. Every library in America bought a Kurzweil machine and made his reputation. However braille offers higher comprehension then listening to voice, And it is a shame they moved away from braille because it is a superior system in many ways. And I did my bachelors thesis on braille Translation by Computer, and it‚Äôs a very easy program, Braille is basically an abbreviation system, And was so well designed it has barely changed in 100 years.  I think with unicode One could make the case that it‚Äôs time to increase from six bumps to nine, But really the thing holding blind Programmer‚Äôs back The lack of a 2d output device that lets them see the screens they‚Äôre drawing. There have been some very interesting patterns from Nokia and Apple relating to vibrating haptic areas on the screen to allow a person to feel something in a region, but none of these devices have ever shipped. You would need some kind of elastic surface that could be raised with electrostatic charge and a grid addressing system. Anyway if anyone is also a mechanical genius they should think about this it would be an immense value to the visually impaired. My thesis advisor was fond of telling me that blind people can do everything except sort socks.</p>

However those controls don‚Äôt work for a blind person, and the CP 88 is not handicap friendly. It is a real shame that Nokia was destroyed by that Microsoft mole elop, They had been working on some really great haptic interface technologies. One of the problems with our Patent system is that you can patent things that you haven‚Äôt actually invented yet. So Companies squat on ideas. If you consider imagination invention then Jules Verne invented everything practically. That guy was unbelievable. Most people don‚Äôt realize that Jules Verne was so imaginative and so futuristic That his novels were considered by his publisher only suitable for children because they were wild fantasies, but almost everything he imagined was implemented eventually. A militant ecoterrorist vegetarian named Captain Nemo, Who made synthetic meat out of plant material And ran around interfering with the whaling industry.</p>

The installation instructions contain obvious mistakes, and then the tutorial refers to a non-existing Web page.
The various videos are worth watching to get the idea, but the implementation is mostly a source of frustration.
For those who tried it out: to uninstall, you need to delete <code>~/.xsh</code> and <code>~/.xiki</code> , both of which are created silently when you first run <code>xsh</code>. And you must remove the line appended to <code>.zshrc</code> (or its bash equivalent), which says <code>source ~/.xsh</code>.</p>

Obvious objections: The user can ruin the ui, and an inexperienced user is almost guaranteed to ruin their ui!
Can you have both? Is it enough to have good undo?</p>

Undo and some sensible process isolation go a long way.  Comfort comes from being able to answer: would clicking this break anything?  One fun dynamic way to tell is to speculatively execute the actions available from a given state recording their effects.  Then you can indicate which is which: does it change the view, the document, a broader model.</p>

Basically, the more performant is the algo the more it is able to infuse the bias of the training dataset.
When it comes to NLP to fight gender bias, there are some technics like <em>gender swapping,biais fine tuning</em>  or <em>learning gender-neutral embedding</em> exist to mitigate the bias (futher reading - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08976">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08976</a>)</p>

<p>My plan is to draw the entire layout, then progressively replace variable references with arrows. I don't want the arrows to ever cross.

<p>By allows 'ref's I always give myself an out, but I'd rather show as many arrows as possible, for clarity's sake.</p>

You could even make it somewhat interactive, where the programmer can put edges <em>roughly</em> where they want them, and then the system can sort of <em>tidy up</em> the layout.</p>
<p>Of course, with these sorts of approaches, you usually have to give up determinism, and naive implementations can be quite slow. You can probably do better than NP, though, since you can take advantage of spatial locality, just like collision detection systems in games.</p>

Mainly it's because the meaning of whatever follows <code>case</code> is surprising if you know Python. It's not regular Python, it looks regular but is designed to work as a structure matching (and name binding language). Consider:
<code>case 123:</code> - matches the value 123. so far so good</p>
<p><code>abc = 123</code>
<code>case abc:</code> - matches 123? No, it matches <em>any</em> value because <code>abc</code> is a name pattern (will capture any value). What if you really wanted to match the value in the variable <code>abc</code>? Well now there's a brand new syntax (which only works inside case): <code>case .abc</code>.</p>
<p>Then there's the class patterns, which look like calls but actually <em>capture</em> values from an existing structure:
<code>case Point(x, y)</code> - creates/sets x and y, if the object is a Point.</p>

<p>I like the idea of pattern matching too. Having it from the start in a language means other features were designed with it in mind. In Python it is being added later so it's going to be more complex to make it seem to fit. Consider the <code>except E as e</code> syntax - it's already kind of a pattern match using just isinstance. Would we not want matching to work identically in that syntax as well? IIRC you can have destructuring assignment in Erlang and put constants on the left, roughly <code>"red", a = f()</code> - this only matches and binds iff f() returns "red" as the first item in a pair. There's no such thing in Python, but you can have only free variables on the left that always get bound. Should that also work now, given the unpacking pattern can use <code>case ["red", a]</code> ?</p>

Sure, one would expect Python programmers to ensure that a class' <code>__init__</code> and <code>__match__</code> are semantically compatible, but I bet we will see many classes whose <code>__init__</code> allows more variations than <code>__match__</code> .

Regarding your other point, about expensive computations, the PEP says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no requirement that the attributes on the proxy object be the same type or value as the attributes of the original object; one envisioned use case is for expensive-to-compute properties to be computed lazily on the proxy object via property getters.

<p>I also think these are warts: in places where both <code>x</code> and <code>x()</code> are valid, the <code>x</code> part means the same exact thing.

What if I wanted to match a specific point at a known x,y? <code>case Point(x, y)</code> wont work, but I feel it should work, given I can do <code>case "hello"</code> and have the value match.

<p>Enso is now going down a tunnel where their system requires them to build the entire stack including editor, debugger, etc. That means more work and an even bigger project. I have some concerns about projects which don't build programs and projects and then work backwards from a project to figure out the best tool to make that project. Trying to design in a single direction is fraught with peril IMHO. All ladders connect two points in space, and one is typically looking for least complex connection between A and B, so one must go back and forth between A and B to optimize the path. This shuttling approach is very expensive in time and effort, but I think product design always works this way. I just saw the Ford F150 announcement, and they had a team of people going camping with their customers, and visiting jobsites, so that they could add in the features that were wanted and needed. The new F150 announcement underwhelmed people, because it was incremental, but in terms of ergonomics they really moved forward solidly towards a product that was more useful to their customers. They even considered the issue of the controls surfaces being usable by people with gloves on. So the knobs and controls are huge. I am helping a friend who is designing a hearing assistive device that is both hardware and software, and you have to make the controls extra big for seniors. I have always made my controls extra big and occasionally gotten hate mail from young punks who ridiculed the jumbo size. That's one thing i am a bit concerned about in the node and wire visual programming world is that they often expect high acuity in order to distinguish the tiny spatial differences between output #1 and output #2.</p>

The text entry field is the most complicated part of every operating system. To render text in a box and handle text entry, that is over 1 million lines of code more than your typical project. There are not even 100 people alive in the world who know the truetype language that underlies text rendering. The text editing library code is therefore deeply tied to either the operating system vendor or one of the few companies that has spent millions of dollars to understand it. So Google, Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, and a few Japanese companies and Samsung, Are among the few places where this technology has been mastered. Text entry is incredibly complicated when you get to Asian languages or right to left languages like Hebrew and Arabic. Haven‚Äôt you ever wondered why the PDF file format took over as the World standard for documents? It‚Äôs because it was the only file format that allowed font embedding, and had missing font fail over technology. Nowadays with soft keyboards on mobile devices the world has gotten very concentrated into just two operating systems. iOS and android, and the market is split between those two about 80/20 Although the economic value of the Apple platform is about 50% due to their more well heeled customer base.</p>
<p>a Console based Product in python can be very platform independent, but the minute you ask for Graphics and the black box of a text entry field you are now tied to an operating system or a platform technology like Adobe Air which offers platform independent text entry fields and font rendering. I am pretty sure that Unity has a cross platform input field technology as well, but I have not used it. The Google Flutter library is an attempt to make a cross platform technology which is powerful, and there is also QT which has been around long enough to cover all sorts of stuff. There are very few Python libraries which delve into font rendering and text entry fields in their full glory. In Photoshop, when you are putting in text, you have the ability to select 5 different rendering styles ("soft", "hard", "sharp", etc.), and you can massage the font rendering process very finely. MS went though a big effort to render fonts on LCD screens more beautifully by doing sub-pixel rendering, i think they called it "Clear Type". This is a very deep area and affects output quality very noticeably. Apple has always had terrific rendering, why artists overwhelmingly prefer OSX over Windows. Human languages are really complicated and supporting them is a huge task. English with its lack of accented letters and very simple structure is pretty much the easiest language on earth. Japanese is actually the most difficult language on earth to handle properly. So the benchmark for most technologies, is how well does it handle Japanese? Korean and Chinese are tough but more uniform than Japanese. calligraphic Arabic is basically impossible. But all the right to left languages present very tricky rendering problems because people intermix left to right and right to left sections in the same sentence.</p>
<p>If you can avoid having a text entry field Like most game machines have a grade of alphabetic characters you type with, then it becomes a great deal easier and now you‚Äôre back to simple polygons and bezier splines and there are dozens of libraries that do those.  Python  has a huge library set.</p>
<p>So the decision point in your library selection process will revolve around, are you going to be doing text entry? And will you have user added fonts in your universe? A lot of GPU graphics libraries start to fizzle out when you get into text entry and fonts. Many a game has been built using bitmaps  of letters, Arranged in spritesheets  so that the GPU you can draw text quickly. The game machine companies spend big money in their OS to handle the intricacies of text so the game programmers don't duplicate a lot of effort.</p>
<p>anyway you have touched on a deep subject that does not permit a simple answer. I spent much of my career making Japanese software and so this area was of great interest to me</p>

<p>Of course any UI toolkit or library is capable of doing that (such as GTK), I'm just wondering if anyone has thoughts on ones which are particularly good at it</p>

Unity favors C++ or JS. Adobe AIR requires Haxe or AS3, OSX requires Swift or ObjectiveC and Android is primarily programmed in Java. Python being interpreted is not typically used to build graphical interactive software. Python has weak module support, so not well suited for large projects. If the reason you like Python is because you prefer indentation significant languages, you can always try my Beads language which is very similar to Python.</p>

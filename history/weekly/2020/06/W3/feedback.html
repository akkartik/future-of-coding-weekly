<p>There's usually a few things worth sharing from each session - issue solutions, presentations of interesting projects and so on.
I edit these down into short YouTube videos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5Vpk-8Y4F9qP2vEn32OPA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5Vpk-8Y4F9qP2vEn32OPA</a></p>
<p>Right now it's mostly visited by people from the vvvv community.</p>
<p>However I would like to expand the reach and mix things up a little üêàüê©.</p>
<p><em>So if you're interested in meeting new people, sharing and discussing ideas and projects or maybe just sitting back while learning something,</em>
<em>please accept my warmest invitation to join us every Wednesday at 17:30 CET at <a href="https://therapy.domj.net/">https://therapy.domj.net/</a></em></p>
<p>Feedback on the format, topics, video quality, etc. is also very much welcome, just as any questions you might have!</p>

I wanted to share a project I worked on for my PhD and hear your thoughts. It is a platform for quickly assembling web apps out of a new kind of software module we call a concept. Concepts are full-stack units of end-user functionality. For example, a comment concept manages the creation and display of comments, and a posting concept lets users create posts.</p>
<p>Each concept exports a set of components, which are similar to components in modern web frameworks like React. A key difference, however, is that concept components have an associated server-side action, which can be synchronized with other actions. In our platform, called D√©j√† Vu, a developer builds an app by including concepts and synchronizing the server-side actions of components. To assemble apps you only write JSON, HTML, and CSS‚Äîno server-side code or client-side JavaScript is required.</p>

Apparently you created new HTML tags. And they have semantics. What i don't see anywhere which baffles me is your data structuring. Programs = Algorithms + data structures according to Prof. Wirth, and where are the data structures? What are the primitive types of your system? If there are no data structures, then how would you do a tic tac toe game for example, where you track the mutable state of the game as it progresses?  Or do you intend the game to be a custom module. JSON is a highly limiting data storage format, it only has boolean, string, and numeric data, and meta data is quite awkward to embed.</p>
<p>I did like that you had students build little test apps.</p>

The goal of D√©j√† Vu is not to be a general-purpose programming system, and it will not be well-suited for some types of web applications like games. That said, in our HTML extension, you can write expressions for the input/output bindings between components, and we have some concepts like ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù, which are quite generic and can be configured to support different use cases.</p>

You can do a lot with plug-ins in CMSs, but plug-ins lack a generic composition mechanism, so composing them often requires a lot very complicated glue code. In D√©j√† Vu, our plug-ins (the concepts) can be combined together more easily through the declarative synchronization of the server-side actions of components. Essentially what we did is build a generic composition mechanism for plug-ins.</p>

&gt; The audience is (A) people that know HTML/CSS ... or (B) people that don‚Äôt necessarily know how to code, which is what the graphical environment is for.
So yes, HTML/CSS is coding ‚Äî that's the point. Deja Vu seems to be intended for people who are right near the dividing line between "comfortable with basic forms of coding" and "not" ‚Äî&nbsp;which is an interesting space, because clearly Deja Vu is a coding tool too, so it's pushing that boundary a bit.</p>

I don't understand your point here. Are you arguing that these existing tools are already doing the work that Deja Vu aims to do? What should Santiago take away from this?</p>

You might be able to build some of these apps using no-code tools, but it‚Äôs more work than using D√©j√† Vu. If you use something like Bubble, for example, you have to write all the end-user behavior yourself (when a user clicks on this button, do this, etc) and if you use a plug-in like Discord for comments, you still need to write back-end triggers for things like when a new comment is created, do X, etc, to get the compound behavior you want. In D√©j√† Vu, you can get compound behavior by synchronizing server-side actions (you only put components inside a &lt;dv.tx&gt; tag).</p>

Then these concepts are composed together declaratively as a html tree data structure (coded by someone or generated by composer UI).
And under the hood, there is something that coordinates the client-server communication (by handling eval/exec), with possible transaction like synchronization for certain events?</p>
<p>I did not fully understood the part about composing concepts.
I think of concept as a "process" (that runs on frontend/backend) with eval and exec operations. So if I have two concepts, how can I combine them?</p>
<p>Will it mean that for combined concept conceptC I will get the conceptA.UI and conceptB.UI somewhere in the UI of combined concept. And both data from conceptA and conceptB will available on eval step (like in a graphql query). And for the exec step ‚Äî the A.exec and then B.exec will be executed in some order?</p>

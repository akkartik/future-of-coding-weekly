The amount of patience and attention to detail it requires to be a programmer means that as an industry we scour the world looking for talent that is so specialized. Most people who try programming quit rather quickly, because it is intolerable to be so fussy. This may change with better languages and tooling, but at the present the field is wide open to anyone who can actually do the work. As my friend Paul mentions, we are too busy digging with dessert spoons to notice the bulldozer demonstration. No other profession i can think of has so few advantages granted for nepotism. For example if your relatives are in a field like politics or entertainment, being the child of a famous person gives you a huge head start.</p>
<p>In my firm only 10 out of 50 employees survived 6 months, because they couldn't do the job. How someone looked, or where they were from was not a factor. All this talk about people of color is maddening to me. This is a brain-based highly creative business. As far as FoC group is concerned, this group is from all over the planet, of people engaged in the struggle to improve how we program computers. All are welcome to the same cactus garden of nitpicking fussy minds.</p>

It’s illogical to assume you understand the experiences of everyone, including those unlike you.</p>
</p> <div class="msg-files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-08T01:01:15.045Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-06-08T01:01:15.045Z">2020-06-08 01:01:15</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">tj: </span> <p><p>(I realise I'm new in this community, have not met any of you, and have yet to contribute substantially, but edward I feel your comment is due a fairly substantial response... so first off- Hi!)</p>
<p><em>"The observation that you don't find the programming community welcoming has nothing to do with race, religion, etc.,"</em> - Edward this is a grossly presumptuous and factually baseless statement. You categorically cannot claim to speak for everyone everywhere in every situation in order to discount "race, religion, etc" as factors of experience, and your very attempt to do so somewhat concerning...! I also encourage you to consider the very important distinctions between 'observation' and (lived) experience...</p>
<p><em>"...but has more to do with the fact that nerds are like cacti, a fussy, prickly bunch."</em> - Edward this is an incredibly reductive and cliché characterisation and again, if you have managed to surround yourself solely with other 'nerds' who are 'like cacti', then that's quite an achievement on your part, however I think it is far more likely you are in fact sadly stereotyping even your own friends and acquaintances purely to try and forge your point. As a 'nerd', and one who knows a whole lot of other 'nerds', I utterly reject your idea of me/us, and even if/when we have prickly moments (which surely I do, too), that is not a get-out-of-jail free card for how I (mis)treat others, and how I (mis)understand the situations around me...</p>
<p><em>"No other profession i can think of has so few advantages granted for nepotism."</em> Edward, nepotism is not the issue being discussed here, unless we expand an idea of 'family' to include class/culture/race/gender/etc in which case yes, tech industry is just as susceptible to 'nepotism' as anywhere else. As a white-european-man I have become increasingly conscious of the situations in which those markers have been what helped get me 'hired' (above a baseline of 'competence' for the required task), as i have 'fit-in', as 'one of the family'....!</p>
<p><em>"In my firm only 10 out of 50 employees survived 6 months, because they couldn't do the job."</em> That is an incredible statistic Edward which should have you asking serious questions about the workspace in which you operate, and the 'culture' you have generated. I would sorely love to chat with the 40 folks who left and see how they <em>felt</em> in that space...</p>
<p><em>"How someone looked, or where they were from was not a factor."</em> Unfortunately, you simply cannot make this claim outright because the effects of discrimination run so insidiously and in so many micro-veins, confounded further by unconscious bias etc... even the most self-aware/pro-active workplaces cannot (but would not try) make that claim. The best anyone/organisation can do is listen, listen, listen, try, try, try, and ensure that their awareness, sensitivity, and response is a little bit better than it was yesterday...</p>
<p>I encourage you to step aside from your evident existing position, and also step aside from 'online chat'/forums/twitter/etc which I'm sure has been part of what's fueled your 'maddening' feeling, and instead take time to deeply consider other perspectives, both observation and experience based, via more considered medium such as the books posted above. Also, please feel free to DM me if you'd like to continue this discussion less publicly.</p>

<p>Will started this thread off with a great prompt:
&gt; now is a good time to reflect on what role people of color can and should play in the future of coding
Let's continue the thread by exploring that.</p>
</p> <div class="msg-files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-08T12:03:16.052Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-06-08T12:03:16.052Z">2020-06-08 12:03:16</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Ivan Reese: </span> <p><p>What would it look like infuse our programming tools with a specific set of politics, or to encode the social values (eg: anti-racism) that we want to champion?</p>
<p>Based on the fact that we see racist values reflected in technology, it stands to reason that it should be possible to make technology that explicitly reflects anti-racist values. We already have technology that explicitly reflects other anti-X values, like FOSS reflecting anti-capitalist values, so this feels quite possible.</p>
<p>(NB. with respect to "design inspired by the present moment", it's worth being mindful of the lesson here: <a href="https://medium.com/design-toast/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-design-challenge-f6e452ff7821">https://medium.com/design-toast/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-design-challenge-f6e452ff7821</a> —&nbsp;there may be Black members of our community who would value weighing-in on this thread, but who are unable to do so.)</p>

Yes, tech can be more “egalitarian”(it’s possible not necessarily a fact because it has a lower barrier to entry, you can learn on the internet for cheap etc) compared to other fields but that does not mean these issues aren’t present. 
And it’s not even necessarily because of malicious intent. 
That’s why it’s useful to think of ways to it more welcoming for other people. There is work to be done not just be like it’s all fine and there is nothing we should do. </p>

We need more women and white people in tech. I say this because it seems that most hard core tech people here are immigrants from Asia and increasingly Africa , often second generation immigrants born here though, and not indigenous Europeans, if there is even such a thing </p>
</p> <div class="msg-files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-08T18:34:09.072Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-06-08T18:34:09.072Z">2020-06-08 18:34:09</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Zubair Quraishi: </span> <p><p>I guess we need a definition to f what people of color is. Having been someone myself who has experienced severe police brutality myself, I think I choose not to focus on issues of race and gender and let people bring themselves up and do what interests them, without trying to force certain stereotypes into such as cruel domain as programming. We may see programming as the future, but in 1000 years they may look back at us all and look at it as modern slave labor , especially when you see the harm that sitting at computers does to our bodies </p>
</p> <div class="msg-files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-08T20:57:07.073Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-06-08T20:57:07.073Z">2020-06-08 20:57:07</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Edward de Jong: </span> <p><p>Half of my close friends in the computer business are multi-millionaires. They did it all without family money, fraternity connections, a  parent in the business, all the usual advantages that are so common in other fields like politics and entertainment. Compare that to the WalMart fortune which wiped out most little hardware stores in America.</p>
<p>The software successes were accomplished  by working faster, harder, and building products and services that were of use to the world around them. None of them had to lie, cheat or steal, or destroy some other firm. It was all additive. They gave people a reasonable product at an attractive price, and the world is better for all their products, just like a book author doesn't crush book authors, it adds to the general wealth of society. This the great opportunity in the software field, to make products out of pure ideas converted into computer code, and the demand for software is almost insatiable, and so opportunities continue to open up, just waiting for someone to solve a longstanding problem, or streamline a tedious paper process.</p>
<p>If i wanted to make a better mousetrap, i might be confronted by the need to raise significant capital, and have barriers to entry. Software is one of the very few fields that allows someone to compete without a lot of capital and/or connections. Yes there are barriers emerging caused by incumbents, but compared to any other field, we are a marvel of open opportunities for those who can do the work.</p>
<p>Software is intellectual property creation at a very high level, and places like the Apple App Store, make it possible for hundreds of thousands of developers to make a living by adding joy and convenience to people's lives. This is a very welcoming space, and a level playing field. Isn't that what most other spheres don't offer?</p>

I've done "tone it down" comments (in the form of "this is drifting off-topic; let me repeat the initial discussion prompt") here-and-there in other threads. It tends not to work. This thread is a bit different, though, as it's not just off topic. In this case, we have one person saying <em>I don't see any racism</em>, surrounded by people saying <em>I do</em>. In the current cultural moment, it is entirely not the time to push the <em>I don't see it, so it doesn't exist</em> argument. If you don't know about the pay gaps, the glass ceilings, the double standards, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias#Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination">algorithmic bias</a>… please go elsewhere to learn about those things. This thread was meant to be a place for people who are already past the <em>7 stages of white grief</em> (to speak very crassly about something serious — sorry) and are ready to engage on the level of <em>here are papers about critical race theory</em> and start working on <em>how do we fix this here in our own practice?</em></p>

<p>(And re: representation in countries outside the USA — that's a very interesting consideration, it it does serve as an interesting <em>counterpoint</em> [in the musical sense] to what's happening in the USA right now. But please be aware that some folks might see it as a <em>counterargument,</em> and that might be hurtful or a distraction. The problem in the USA, the problem of interest right now due to the cultural moment, isn't just about, say, the relative percentage of various races employed in tech. It's a far broader and deeper issue. I hope that enough of us are aware of the scope of that issue and are able to think about how to address it. That's the conversation Will set up, and that's the conversation we should be having in this thread.

What data structures do I use?</p>
<p>Source code isn't text, it is a tree. Probably the tree is annotated with semantic information: What binding is this identifier bound to (if known)? What is the type of this subexpression (if known)? How do you keep the annotations up to date while the code is being edited?</p>
<p>Commentary is obviously treated differently. In old school text based languages, a comment is /<em>...</em>/ or //...\n, is treated as white space by the lexical analyzer and discarded early: they don't appear in the AST. In a tree language, comments must work differently. They aren't a kind of white space that appears between tokens, they are either tree nodes or attributes attached to tree nodes. Examples of how this works? What is the syntax of a comment, and are there different kinds, depending on the part of a code tree they are annotating? For example, within a module (a list of definitions), a "section header" comment that introduces a block of definitions might be treated differently from a comment that describes a single definition.</p>

<p>I took inspiration from something Joe Armstrong said in this article regarding comments [1].</p>
<p>Namely, that comments don't really come before or after a block of text. They're an annotation <em>on</em> that block of text. In most programming languages, that means putting the comment directly above or below a block.</p>
<p>With a projectional editor, you have the luxury of attaching a comment directly to a node in your language tree.</p>
<p>In the tool I'm hacking on, I represent code on disk as json, and every object in the json file can have a "comment" property.</p>

Right now, I have an interpreter and compiler for a text based language.
• The parser converts text to a parse tree;
• the semantic analyser converts the parse tree to an intermediate representation (IR) that can be either directly interpreted, or
• The code generator converts IR to code.
To make a projectional editor for this language, I need different internal data structures.
Rather than grope in the dark, I was hoping to learn lessons from an existing successful design.</p>

Disclaimer: this is not informed by any other projects or literature, but just what I came up with.
Regarding comments, in alv I do also need to keep comments in the parsed tree rather than just ignore them during parsing (I need that for the editor prototype, although that is a minor interest, but mainly to be able to turn the parsed tree back into the exact string it was parsed from. You'll need that for a projectional editor too I guess). To do that, I firstly consider comments as whitespace. In my syntax grammar, all bottom-level constructs (literals) contain no whitespace, but there is a piece of "required whitespace" between arguments in an S-expression and a piece of "optional whitespace" after the opening and before the closing parenthesis. So an S-Expression contains N child-expressions and N+1 (potentially empty) whitespace segments. I do not parse the comments especially or associate them to other elements, but your whitespace could also be a structure that explicitly stores comments as separate entities.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em> in case it's not clear, the structure I use is an AST.</p>

<p>For example, you don't so much need to represent a comment before, after, or inline with a line of code. Instead, such comments are the only means for providing metadata (annotations) to parts of a program. So do <em>that</em>, and then if you need to generate source code from it, then you could inject comments as the only way to capture that metadata in the output. Not the other way around.</p>

<p>I had one UI component per type of AST node. The components rendered text fields and drop targets and other standard web UI affordances to support editability.</p>
<p>Variable bindings, types, etc, are derivative information that I could cache when necessary, or just recompute from the AST as-needed. I mostly did the latter.</p>
<p>Because I designed the AST for projectional editing, there were comment slots on any node that would benefit from special rendering of comments, and I had a comment block node that you could wrap any other block of code in to describe what that block did. If you’re using someone else’s AST, you may not have that luxury, but you may be able to write your own AST for editing and a translation layer between yours and the executable AST. I have parsed JavaScript ASTs to guess which comments document which other nodes and with some heuristics you can guess pretty well.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

If programming is about building software tools for other to use then I agree that it will follow the arc you describe. If you see programming as a way to solve problems and understand the world in a dynamic medium then it will evolve more like writing.
Those are not mutually exclusive because when we design software we fundamentally do two things: (1) we define the behavior of the software to solve a problem and (2) we produce an acceptable implementation.
I think (2) will follow the arc you describe and will even go beyond because it can be much more automated than the design of physical artifacts. But we will hopefully democratize (1).</p>

That is, the tools, languages, libraries and everything else are ultimately in service of a problem. If you can solve that problem by <em>not</em> writing code, then you have actually done your job as a programmer. One of the things I have learned about being productive as a programmer is that the code you don't write is often vastly more important than the code you do write. Sometimes ecosystems of tools and blocks that you can take apart are actually just code being for itself. Maybe we don't need to solve the "standard ways for software-pieces to talk to each other". Maybe we can define or architect that problem away altogether.</p>

Yes, we share our findings and experiences, but it’s mostly random and at best enables some serendipity.</p>
<p>If just a small group of us here would coordinate their efforts for some time, which doesn’t even mean to work on the same thing, just agreeing on a specific problem to solve and splitting work to explore a certain part of the solution space in a concerted effort, we could probably make significant progress.</p>
<p>It looks like we have the corner stones for a great team right here: alignment on a vision + complementary skill sets. Even funding seems solvable, if we can demonstrate commitment of a dedicated team working towards a common goal.</p>

<p>There is a core few of us who have a novel approach and are unlikely to get much out of collaborating with others with significantly different approaches.</p>
<p>Then there are the folk from commercial enterprises and those who want incremental improvements to IDEs and other tooling. I don't see them or their work as the subject of this thread, but I'm happy to be told otherwise.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's only 5 of us on this thread, so maybe we should start by re-pinning to <strong><code>#general</code></strong> ..?</p>

In parallel there will be the tricky question of funding. If it is not solved, maybe I will go in a cycle à la <strong>Duncan Cragg</strong>: some paid periods that fund the unpaid projects.</p>

1. Remember McLuhan: the medium is the message. This community is organized around three stream-type media (see <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/amp/">this essay</a> for stream vs. garden): a podcast, a Slack, and a newsletter. These are media for exchanging information, not for collaborating. Garden-type media that support collaboration are, unfortunately, much less numerous. Basically we have Wikis and Git repositories. Someone needs to set up a garden and oversee its evolution. That's work, and unfortunately not highly valued nowadays. Ask Open Source maintainer for testimonials. I suspect this is the main obstacle to be solved.
2. What we all have in common is dissatisfaction with the present state of the tech world. That doesn't mean we have the same goals, nor the same ideas about reaching our goals. I doubt we could all productively collaborate. So we need to aim for "getting things done" communities (plural) that overlap with this one but which are not identical.</p>

I've been trying to bring the "alternative programming" community together for years with various workshops. It is like herding cats. My latest idea is that if we could agree on a set of challenge problems, we could at least establish some basis for communication, comparison, and feedback.</p>

Challenge problems are one way to formulate common goals. My point is that discussing challenge problems here on Slack will just lead to another interesting discussion that will die out after a few days.

I think in light of what is happening around us, it will be quite tone deaf of people who considers the future of coding not to consider the people making it happen. My DMs are open to people who want to share/discuss antiracism even within code. just today, I worked with a coworker to make sure we stop using black/white list and use block/allow list instead. seems rather trivial and we know the intentions wasn’t a racist one, but this is a purposeful change in our codebase to remove subtle/nonsubtle racism.</p>

If it's small, it's an integer, if it's big it's a pointer. Well, first off, .NET can't support that, but maybe you don't mind.  Anyway, the very fact that integers have variable size forces every "add" operation to become two checks for "is this first operand a big int, or is this other operand a big int" alongside each 64-bit add operation. It also precludes standard vectorization. Equality tests are trickier... if two 64-bit values are unequal, you have to then check whether they are pointers and if so, call an equality-testing function. Perhaps worst of all, every time an integer goes out of scope you have to check if integer memory has to be freed. This could be mitigated with alloca, but only for integers that are local to the function. What if a bigint is located inside a struct on the stack? It can't use the optimization unless it "knows" it is on the stack.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, BigInt support is great, but in my career I've mostly written performance-critical code which I would usually design to avoid overflow reliably, rather than suffer the performance penalty of a BigInt.</p>

I'm <em>designing</em> a language, not using BigInts as a library feature. Accordingly, situations where you can "avoid overflow reliably" are amenable to static analysis. It seems like it should be easy to identify sequences of operations where integer size won't change substantially, and you can perform a single size check before entering such a block of code, then branch to either a 64-bit version or a BigInt version as necessary. And memory management is also a language/runtime implementation issue which is going to have to be dealt with for general data structures either way.</p>

```def do_it(x, y)
  if x &gt; y
   x = x + y
  else
   x = x - y
  end
end</p>
<p>number_x = read_from_stdin
number_y = read_from_stdin
do_it(number_x, number_y)```
This is completely arbitrary, of course, but at which location can you reliably know you can avoid overflow? Any code that takes input could be handed values which cause an overflow at some point right? If you are duplicating logic (i.e. you have a 32-bit version, 64-bit version and perhaps more) how do you know which one to use? The only way you can know if it will overflow is essentially by doing the mathematical operation, so checking which path to take is at least as complicated as just doing it, which means you just need to do it and check for overflows and extend/retry with the next size. I'm having a hard time seeing how static analysis helps here except in arbitrarily small cases where you can compute the entire possible result space and prove it and all intermediate values are less than x-bits. I'm not sure if static analysis of this kind can really be reduced below the complexity of the halting problem, which is an NP-hard problem.</p>

Often the numbers you'll be working with will be pieces of program state, or derivatives thereof. Either way, imagine number_x and number_y are used in a lot of different expressions (they're some key value like the position of a particle). Then we might be able to deduce the following: if number_x and number_y are &lt;= 32 bits, then the calculations they are used within will not overflow a 64-bit register (in the above example they simply need to be &lt;= 63 bits). That's the static analysis. What can we do then? Create a <em>fast</em> code path (no size checks, no BigInts, no DRAM access) for the small number case, and a <em>slow</em> code path for the big number case. Branch into the correct path based on an initial test of number_x and number_y.</p>

I don't believe that static analysis could ever work. If you have a mysterious function for which you don't know the result range, then  mystery(3) * 2 becomes unknowable in terms of required bit size.  For a vast number of applications, double precision floating point has proven adequate, which is why it is the main numeric type used in JS and AS3.   A long time ago FLOAT64 was so slow (100x slower than integer) one would go to great lengths to avoid it, but IBM and Intel cracked the code on fast floating point, and now you don't even think about it. I think Motorola's inability to build a fast floating point unit may have been a factor in Apple ditching Motorola for PowerPC.</p>

Some of the libraries had a maximum precision threshold you could set, which sounds like the thing you want to avoid. Other libraries dodged that by doing all calculations in a <a href="http://algebrite.org">symbolic way</a> (<a href="https://github.com/davidedc/Algebrite#references">see also</a>). There were a bunch of libraries I came across, but I didn't end up saving links to them because I never found one that fit my performance needs (ie: perfect precision with relatively constant execution time that handles the accumulation of millions of operations).</p>

The very principle of floating-point arithmetic is to make the precision part of the storage format for each number, in order to ensure a constant storage size, no matter which operations you do. If you are OK with indefinite storage size, as for big integers, then go for rational numbers.</p>
<p>Something that many people don't realize is that floats a <em>subset</em> of rationals with fixed storage size. Perhaps it's because so many languages call them "reals" that so many people think floats are a <em>superset</em> of rationals, whereas reality is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If what you want is a superset of rationals, go for computable numbers (the subject of Alan Turing's famous paper that introduced the Turing machines). A number is then represented by a procedure that you call with the requested precision.

As soon as you compute 1/3, it's impossible to represent that exactly in either binary or decimal floating point. However, if you use decimal notation for your floating point inputs, use decimal floating point representation, and restrict your operations to add, subtract and multiply (no division, no exponentials or trigonometry), then I think it could be done. If you extend this system of exact arithmetic to support division, then you need to store a denominator, which means you are using rationals.</p>

Also, the Intel 8087 subunit  which is inside every Intel compatible chip for over 20 years has operations that do everything in 80 bits precision, and is then downconverting to 64 bits after you run a long sequence of operations and store the result into a double precision result. In this way they avoid rounding errors from creeping in. It is extremely clever and although not amenable to parallel operation, is still the preferred way to do floating point in the intel world because it doesn't accumulate error like everyone else's 64 bit arithmetic operations, which accumulate error rather quickly. 80 bits is 10 bytes, and there are even BCD instructions in the 8087 unit which i have occasionally used. They are nearly forgotten nowadays as no higher level language i know of lets you access them, you have to write in Assembler. A tiny bit of assembler can ofttimes do some very clever things.</p>

A working product is better proof than a paper without proof, so it wasn't going to stop me, but it would have been nicer had i been able to publish the major features in an article so that I could get credit for the novel things. It is one of the forms of alternative payment currencies, to get credit for an invention or improvement. It is one of the reasons people publish, in addition to the communist ideal of increasing the public wealth.</p>

<p>It looks like it’s a pure language/BERT model… Is there a clear path toward integrating with external sources of information like the Python runtime? I’m noticing in your example that some likelihood is assigned to sequences that refer to variables that don’t appear to be in scope.</p>

At the moment this model is a pure Masked Language Model (a version of RoBERTa) which has 10 layers, and 12 attention head per layer.(With a max position embedding of 1024) And it was trained on about 6M lines of code. So this is just a start. Context Awareness in code means something slightly different than what it means for Natural Language. We have big plans for future. We plan to try out mix modal models (one where we mix graph based and text based information together) to bring more code centric awareness in it. Also, we plan to run some kind of Rule Engine on top of the prediction to cut some noise (Here we can hook into the actual Python runtime/interpreter to gain more insights). Also we are planning to train longformer or refomrer type model to calculate local attention based on a large body of code.</p>
<p>At the moment the <code>&lt;mask&gt;</code> token is only for a single token. However, we have plans to fine-tune this model for many downstream tasks.</p>
<p>We started a series of notebooks showing different applications of this model and will release more powerful and hybird models in future.

Last time I looked, it seemed that WASM was a half-completed work in progress, and the tooling wasn't complete. So the longer you wait, the easier it will be. I figured the sweet spot will be 2021 for my purposes, otherwise I'd be working around limitations and constantly running to catch up. WASM seems to be progressing quickly, so for projects with fewer requirements than mine, it may be ready right now. Issues I noticed, last time I checked, included lack of support for C++ exceptions, threads, vectorized instructions, GPU access, and difficulty of using the C++ build tools. Rust appeared to have the best tooling.</p>

At present, it is limited to running in a separate thread, and cannot access the DOM directly.  All of us JS-haters were hoping for a clean virtual machine with direct API access to the BIOS which would be the DOM. If they had done that it would have created a virtual OS that would have permitted all the languages to easily move to that new universal OS. Instead, JS still rules, and WebAsm is for async heavy computation. Sure you can implement some complex back-and-forth system, but that defeats the whole purpose of getting closer to the metal. If Google &amp; co. let other languages in, it could well lessen their control of the ecosystem. At present the V8 engine reigns supreme; it is an exceptional performing piece of code, but also super complex.</p>

And you have to used shared memory blocks to communicate between these two processes. That is not what i call a full opening to other languages in the browser universe.  On a  mac or pc, or mobile device you can write in any language, and as long as you package it as an executable for the OS, the OS doesn't care a bit which source languages you used.</p>

In one sense, you’re right that Go can’t directly call the OS because it only has access to thunks and data that the VM owner puts in its environment, but on the other hand, the OS is accessed in JavaScript entirely through the global object so the “opening” doesn’t need to be very wide at all for access to the OS to be about even in JS and wasm in practice.</p>
<p>There must be synchronization overhead if the wasm executes in another thread (I didn’t know it did, that’s good to know!), but I haven’t noticed it. Wasm must be implemented in a more efficient way than Web Workers, because worker isolation is so strict that you can’t call one synchronously from, say, an event handler that needs to finish in one JS event loop tick, but you can call wasm in an event handler.</p>
<p>The people working on WASI are trying to create a shim that encompasses every functionality that you’d typically get from an OS, so that every compiler can just target that one shim instead of inventing a new one for their language. That’ll provide some of the language-independence you’re talking about, especially since if it becomes standard, browsers can implement DOM access directly instead of relying on memory sharing with JS.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, the Go shim is here, just a few hundred lines: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js"></a><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js">https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js</a> The system calls it exports to wasm binaries are in importObject (syscall/js.valueGet, syscall/js.valueSet, etc).</p>

Due to the lack of interface types, the interaction between VM and wasm code is painfully low-level, but it can be done. What's your use case and which PL would you like to embed the Wasm VM into?

&gt; This is why I see potential for visual programming —&nbsp;it's not just a way to make the programming experience more&nbsp;<em>live</em>, it's actually a way to make the programming experience embedded within and subservient to the arts. Like Flash, but more so.
And Scratch offer something like that: you program the sprites and even the scene. You have a simple sound editor and a drawing tool built in, and I see lots of children spending more time drawing than programming, some doesn't even feel like to program at all. In the end you might feel that programming is only one mean among others in your creation process.</p>

I feel the same that it is difficult to make an incremental move from one maximum (now/text programming only for experts) to an other (future/programming that end user can do).
&gt; There's not a lot of need or market in that valley between the peaks. The mountain has to be climbed from the bottom, and it's counterintuitive to make a "programming language" that "isn't for programmers" (at first).
That is why I guess that a good approach can be to make something that is targeted at end-user programmers. Maybe with a secondary focus to make some expert programmers happy, but not try to convince or make them move all at once.</p>

Especially the Pixar anecdote (thanks <strong>Tim Babb</strong> for sharing it 🙂 ). I guess that any "advanced" are the tools, you will always be able to use it in a messing way. And there will be always cases where it is reasonable to program messy things (as for the Pixar example). For me this is inherent to the act of programming: you are always making compromise between "perfect" (at least perceived perfection, but that is another subject) and "useful/actually used". And I guess it is important to have this central aspect of programming in mind when creating programming tool.</p>

<p>There’s a small handful of people that I’ve been requested again and again to interview on the Future of Coding podcast.&nbsp;<a href="http://jenniferjacobs.mat.ucsb.edu/">Jennifer Jacobs</a>&nbsp;is one of those people. Her work on&nbsp;<a href="http://jenniferjacobs.mat.ucsb.edu/#db">Dynamic Brushes</a>&nbsp;in particular, and parametric drawing in general, occupies a major intersection between disciplines and provides insights that we can all apply to our own work. This interview touches on childhood education, programming tools for both non-programmers and expert programmers, tangible interfaces, wearable and embodied computation, aesthetics, the relationship between academia and industry, means of evaluating the efficacy of projects, geometric encodings of first-order logic, symbolic representations, whether&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>&nbsp;could exist outside MIT, and more. Jennifer does a wonderful job articulating the nature her own work, but also the works of her collaborators, peers, and influences, so that we come away with a great understanding for the broader spaces in which her research fits. Jennifer is already am important figure in our Future of Coding field, and I am very excited to follow her career and see all the places the impacts of her work will be felt.</p>
<p>You’ll notice right away that&nbsp;<strong>Steve Krouse</strong> is sitting in the interviewer chair this time. This is the first of a handful of episodes that Steve recorded in 2019 but didn’t release. I’m planning to edit and release them throughout 2020, so you’ll hear a bit more of Steve yet.</p>

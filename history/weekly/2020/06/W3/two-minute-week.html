Did you come up with that yourself? Or do you have any pointers to what inspired you?</p>
<p>Iâ€˜m also curious how you settled on Markdown parsing for the demo? Iâ€˜m strangely attracted to Markdown for a prototype as well.</p>

The only reason there was a demand for sandboxed web apps historically was that native apps on PCs had so thoroughly polluted the well for users. But in a world where apps are always distributed with source and there's a culture of calling folks out for dark patterns, you don't need the web to run apps anymore.</p>
<p>My ideas here are a lot less well-formed than for the foundations of Mu, so I'm extremely open to suggestions. Markdown's just the first syntax I tried to avoid designing a 15th standard. Though I'm already seeing crap I'm never going to support, like this:</p>
<p><code>This is *emphasized
# text.* Or is it?</code>
Things are simpler if I require headings to always start a new paragraph.</p>
<hr><p>I came up with the algorithm myself, but it felt like a fairly straightforward multi-pass compiler design. The only minor issue was the chicken-and-egg problem of needing sizes to compute field offsets, and needing field offsets to compute sizes. I'm not well-versed with the theory of Algorithms so I can't cite good keywords here. But I think a lot of people would be able to come up with it after completing a grad course in compilers. Once the problem was framed.</p>

I'm all for a simpler standard and would be happy to break backwards compatibility, getting rid of some of those weird edge cases. Complexity of implementation is particularly important for standards where we hope to see many implementations, but hardly ever considered.</p>
<p>We learn so much from implementing a thing, but we tend to only practice additive design, cramming more things into it over time. Maybe that is the nature of things. At some point more people feel that the old thing is now bloated and that opens the door for another, better designed, simpler thing to take over. Somewhat the story of Mu, I guessâ€¦ ;)</p>

Did you fix the audio glitch from the previous video?</p>
<p>Also â€” is 2 LFOs always going to be the limit? It seems like the current UI for LFOs wouldn't really scale up to more. I'm curious to see if that's just a temporary situation, or if you're actually comfortable with this as (say) a creative constraint and plan to keep it that way.</p>

You could add more LFO nodes, and hook them into units as you see fit.
I suppose there is the limitation that, for example, the Oscillator pitch can only be modified by 2 (3 if you include the combination) LFO waves.  I could certainly make the Oscillator take 'n' waves I guess - since I have the ability for pins that grow like arrays.  I just thought that this was probably enough for now.</p>

You can think of this as the visual result of your live code script.  But I haven't discounted the option of editing the graph.  You can see in one of my earlier videos that the canvas can be zoomed/panned - so I'm thinking about this for the future.
This week I'm hoping to try some scripting.</p>

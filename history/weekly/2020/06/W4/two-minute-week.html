<p>How does your approach to out-of-order compilation interact with other language features, like error handling or polymorphism or extension (if you have those)? Eg: what happens if you've used a field that doesn't appear in the type definition? How do you do namespacing without modules?</p>

It's fairly unambitious as a language; all the attention has gone to bootstrapping the implementation out of machine code.</p>
<p>But your concrete question is quite acute. "What happens if you've used a field that doesn't appear in the type definition?" I hadn't thought of it yet when I made the video. It only occurred to me in the past week. I now raise an error if a type definition failed to reconcile some field from earlier. But it's a fairly klunky error message; it just says, "you used field <code>x</code> but it doesn't exist." It can't give the line or even function that used <code>x</code>. Providing such errors is going to complicate the implementation quite a bit, needing to attach source info to uses of fields in types. But I <em>did</em> stake out a position in my paper as being all about the quality of error messages. This whole thing is now making me quite unhappy. Perhaps I'll toss out this flexibility after all.</p>
<p>Funny story: the previous prototype of Mu (a tree-walking interpreter) <em>did</em> have support for literate programming. (And function overloading, and generics, none of which are in the current prototype.) I hadn't connected the dots to think of this as a particularly Literate feature. That might be a good justification to take it out. Thanks!</p>
<p><em>The reason Mu doesn't have LP anymore</em>: I was fine encouraging hunks to refer to local variables that were in the same scope but far away in some other part of the description. However, the way Mu now exposes and requires using registers, hunks can now <em>destroy</em> local variables far away in the same scope (that happen to share the same register). That feels too mind-bending.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I should allow <em>shadowing</em>. So you can't insert naked statements using Literate directives, only blocks. Hmm, that could work. (If I can get the error messages good enough.) Thanks!</p>

On the one hand I'm constantly pushing for programs in a system to be aware of their dependencies. However, I also dislike modules and namespaces and the need in general to micromanage dependencies in the small within a single program, to manually provide information that a compiler could just deduce.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a contradiction, and I need to give up opinions that made sense in the context of a highly dynamic, high-level, expressive Lisp dialect. Perhaps a low-level language built in machine code should throw up its hands and require the programmer to do a little more work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps this is a <em>paradox</em>, and what the two positions share is a desire for parsimonious dependencies. Tools to specify dependencies within a project tend to encourage larger projects with more code. Mu lacks modules for the same reason Mu lacks packages and will never have a package manager.</p>

<p>Reader, please let the author know what you think of this precious-snowflake navel-gazing.
I think you have some tough decisions ahead of you.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I should allow&nbsp;<em>shadowing</em>.
Is Mu aimed at beginners? If so, be careful about shadowing. In my experience every new programmer steps on that nail, and I've known some who were then scared away from taking advantage of it for evermore. (Example of the nail: top-level variables can be shadowed, struct members can't, but you often assign to both in the same way.)</p>
<p>Perhaps a low-level language built in machine code should throw up its hands and require the programmer to do a little more work.
That could be a worthwhile bunt for the time being, and you could come back to this in the future.</p>

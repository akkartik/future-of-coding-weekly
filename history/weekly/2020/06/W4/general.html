In typical programming languages these representations are the same (code is edited as text and stored 1:1). In structured / projectional editing environments the editing representation is often non-textual. Even though these environments separate presentation from storage, it seems like a by-product while the focus lies on the editing experience. I'd like to see studies of the implications of separating presentation and storage representations for programming languages. I can imagine that this could help backwards-compatible language evolution, end a lot of syntax bike-shedding discussions and probably even let different programming languages share common concepts. I'm not the first one to think about this for sure, but I didn't manage to find useful resources.</p>

If the storage representation is quite different from the text presentation (eg, XML vs C-like syntax), then you'll be using a tree as an intermediate representation. Even though "the presentation / editing representation is text", there is a challenge if you want to provide a convention text editing interface, because maybe not all texts can be backward mapped into your tree representation (eg, what about mismatched parentheses)? So what happens? If there is a syntax error, you can't save your file until the syntax error is fixed? Or you provide a "structured editing" interface that doesn't allow you to make syntax errors? What I've read about structure editors is that there's a learning curve, and you run into the problem that a lot of common idioms that programmers learn for editing code using a conventional text editor don't work in a structure editor, creating frustration.</p>

At Storyscript we have a projectional editor which doesn't show syntax errors per se, it only says when code is correct and "runnable". We couple that with "grammar suggestions" like in MS Word / Grammarly to help show you how to make corrections. In this way, any syntax that isn't "valid" is simply stored as stylable text. It took a lot of trial-and-error to figure out how strict our exportable/saveable representation would be to an AST, but we struck a pretty good balance IMO (leaning more towards flexibility / error tolerant than what we started with).
A part of our approach was made more complex, because we threw the whole "compilation pipeline concept" out the window, and went with managing our authoring tool using an ECS data model (like in game development)</p>

I heard of it but never really took a deeper look. It's time for that I guess. Regarding mapping into the storage representation: I would be ok with not allowing to save code that contains syntax errors. It shouldn't be too hard to bring code into a form that parses, and on the other hand this forces you to deal with these kinds of errors early. Committed code and input to compilers would be guaranteed to be well formed to some extend, which I think is a good thing.
Structured editing doesn't work IMO when requiring each edit to map from one valid AST to another valid one. There's just to many operations needed for this to be practical. Text editing allows composing a few simple edit operations into larger transformations, kinda unix-philosophy style.</p>

I don't know much more detail than that. I'm aware he recently rewrote a fair amount of code and I'm not sure exactly what has changed.
I suggested he join this community, but he's pretty busy, so not sure if he will. He regularly answers related questions on the HMN discord if you want to probe further: <a href="https://discord.gg/hxWxDee">https://discord.gg/hxWxDee</a></p>

Coding it up in C++ is especially cumbersome... and it is Windows-only, mainly because it is very difficult to use COM without registering everything in the Registry.</p>
<p>It's brittle; it is not designed to support any kind of incremental change. If you change an interface, even just to add a new method, you must generate a new GUID, and now software coded against the old interface can't find your new version unless you've got a compatibility class in there. You can try to cheat by adding methods to the bottom - COM never stops you from shooting yourself in the foot - and this is safe in limited circumstances but causes crashes otherwise.</p>
<p>There's two kinds of COM, the dynamic VB-style interfaces (can't remember the technical term for this) and the static C++-style interfaces. The dynamic kind is easy to use from VB but a pain in the ass to use from C++.</p>
<p>There are no standard nontrivial data types, such as lists or hashtables. There are no generic types.</p>
<p>It uses confusing terminology like "apartments" that the MS documentation explains poorly.</p>
<p>So, I always prefer C# / .NET for interoperability, as well as for Windows app development in general... especially since much of your code can run on Linux/Mac too. There is also a .NET interpreter for web browsers now ("Blazor").</p>

Getting published is almost as mysterious as getting a grant. I tried a few times to get a grant but was unsuccessful. One time i bid on a USAID project on Tanzania, where i was going to ship container loads of paper and HP LaserJets with satellite internet to a small set of towns outside the capital, so they could print textbooks on demand that were created by a small staff in the capital, with bilingual versions for the regional languages. With a net price of about $3 per 100 page book, it was the most cost effective textbook delivery system imaginable, and the state dept liked the project and we were in the final contention, but the big textbook company that was planning to sell the typical books for $80 a book got them to delay the offering and kills us because we couldn't keep hanging onto a project that never starts at a predictable time. You can't hold a staff without already having projects. Knowing how to navigate the grant system is a truly dark art, and the people who know how to wrangle grants on a consistent basis earn a lot of money and have ultimate job security. One of the groups i bumped into called their Washington office "proposal island", because it becomes a continuous process.</p>

The main tool was excel. Software shops kept delivering junk that nobody used. The acquisitions guys loved a slick demo and that’s pretty much all it did. They’d come in and install a new server cluster, which means a bigger server room, which means more cooling, which means a bigger generator, which means more diesel trucks, which means more convoys on the road, which means more getting blown up. New grunts would tool around on it for a month and then get a novel task they had to use excel for, and never go back. The acq guys had such disdain for the ‘users’ that they couldn’t imagine that they actually knew WTF they were doing. The slick demo went on to win the DCGS contract, and now they’re stuck with ‘easy’ where they need flexible, customizable, fast, simple (all the way down the stack).”</p>

<p>More often than not it would be documentation of context and ideas than what the code itself does. Or reminders to myself why I can't do certain things I want to do.</p>
<p>But I think where these notes would be particularly useful is when trying to learn a codebase and a system. How do all these things hook together? What things have I discovered so far and what open questions do I have? What pitfalls have I run into? </p>
<p>In clojure I would also leave some "Rich comments" of code that I can run in the repl but isn't cleaned up for others. </p>
<p>If I could make these personal notes I would write more documentation. Because now documentation doesn't have to be clean all at once or something that will pass code review. I can continue to refine overtime and promote.</p>

Thank you GitHub and <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8183-gitlink">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8183-gitlink</a>! With hyperlinks for any line of code at any point in time I can just use regular docs (Google docs, LaTeX, Confluence, Markdown, plain text) to create pretty decent private documentation.</p>
<p>I still can't hyperlink to any line of code at <em>all</em> points in time, so that it's the same line but carrying forward transparently as new commits roll in. But I find it's actually better to err on the side of situating documentation timefully rather than timelessly. That way I'm constantly reminded that documentation can go out of date.</p>
<p>In principle it sucks that I can't get backlinks. "What are all my notes that link inside function <code>foo</code>?" But in practice I've just never had <em>that</em> many docs about any single function, so I haven't missed it <em>that</em> much. Plain docs + hyperlinks may well be the 80% solution that gets us well into the region of diminishing returns.</p>

In theory we could replace all of it with plain old function composition. The same could be said of data (aka "homoiconicity"). Even the idea of a "programming language" / compiler is just a function from code to code, and that boundary need not be so hard or all that separate from the thing being built from it (aka "infrastructure as code", i.e. another examine of reifying what something is and how it's made as code aka actions)</p>

And reevaluate for fit-ness.</p>
<p>The main difference between UI and API is mechanism; it's still the interaction boundary, and should be the thing you get right first for the right reasons governed by the outer context; and then everything else is just the stuff that makes that interface actually work.</p>

Once both machines are running a common protocol, even if that protocol is used to bootstrap more sophisticated protocols, I feel like we've moved beyond talking to aliens.</p>
<p>I don't know where to draw the line, though. Is it fair to assume both machines speak tcp? ip? I don't think Brett is suggesting computers should organically re-discover ethernet based on analog probing, but I do think he's suggesting more than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)">bonjour</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite take on it, which I don't think is an indented reading, is that computers need to share a common protocol with their neighbors, but not necessarily their neighbors neighbors.</p>

<p>Here's a blunt view on lightning talks, in text comic format.</p>
<p>You think, "it'd be cool to see what everybody is working on."
You say, "let's all do talks on our projects.."
You think, "oh but I don't want to hear Kartik drone on about his lame-ass project for the umpteenth time."
You say, "..but just $TOO_FEW minutes per person."</p>
<p>Ok Kartik, if you're right, why does YC do demo day? They're pretty smart people, and their audience is smart people too.</p>
<p>Demo day is intended to drive a certain kind of action. The audience is people who've honed their pattern recognition for a very specific format of yes/no decision. The emphasis is on the final decision rather than the road taken to get to it. And the organizers are aiming for a feeling of scarcity to pressure investors into quick decisions. Nothing wrong with any of that, but none of it feels relevant to this group, where the goal is thoughtful appreciation rather than rapid action. (Right?)</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the answer is. Maybe we need something more like Science Fair? Put up your shingle for a predetermined hour, hack on your project if nobody shows up. If somebody shows up you give them your schtick. If it's someone who's already heard the schtick, maybe you answer their questions. Or maybe they don't have questions, they just wanna watch you hack. Or if your buddy shows up, you pair. Most importantly, anybody who doesn't care about your project knows what time to claim a prior engagement for.</p>

Your points resonate with me. To go from here, let me pick out a few things I like about the demo day idea (and I encourage others to do the same), so that we can try to design something that keeps the good parts.</p>
<p>Things that I like about the demo day idea:
• It's a singular event, which will garner more attention than a recurring thing
• It's presentations (prepared) rather than conversations (improvised)
• There's variety — maybe <em>you</em> won't come away thinking of every project, but each project will probably come away with someone new thinking about it
• This feels like something distinct from <strong><code>#two-minute-week</code></strong> and the podcast. If we just do 2 minute presentations with a hard cutoff, that's just a live broadcast of <strong><code>#two-minute-week</code></strong>. If we just do 1 project per event, and make the events regularly occurring, that's just a live broadcast of the podcast.</p>

<p>Couple of design decisions don't make sense yet. Like, why is there both an inspector and the ability to split a definition across a row?</p>
<p>How do definitions take args? Just through the same row/stack? That means you can't define a function spanning cells that takes an arg?</p>

this. A spreadsheet is a document for presenting, visualizing and working with financial data. Historically, it is a sheet of paper, marked with a grid, in which financial data is recorded and totals calculated manually. The mathematical relationships between the numbers in the grid are implicit: they are understood (by the human viewer) from context, and not written down. So when we represent a spreadsheet on a computer, and automate the process of computing the sums, we of course show the important financial data, and hide the boring, trivial code that computes the sums. Why would you show the code? The point of a spreadsheet is not to <em>write a program</em>, it is to visualize and work with your financial data.</p>
</div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-17T15:52:00.362Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="#2020-06-17T15:52:00.362Z" class="date">2020-06-17 15:52:00</a> <div class="message"><p>That is indeed helpful. I was kinda aware of it, but I hadn't focused on it. Historically, was the exact same template reused for page after page?</p>
<p>To rephrase my question: what is the essence of spreadsheets' success? Does LoGlo violate this essence, thereby rendering it just another speculative programming model? Or does it preserve the essence, just adding a nice feature that helps with some use cases? This is what I don't understand. History (particularly pre-software history) feels like one input here, but not the whole answer.</p>
<p>The point of programming is not to write a program either. The point of programming is to build a tool. The <em>skill</em> of programming is to not make a mess in the face of complexity creep. Paper naturally provides guardrails against messes. It restricts the menu of formulae available. And if you were doing something new you probably had a lower density of formulae on the page. And there was a tendency for large formulae to take up more space on the page. Moving to virtual paper eliminates these restrictions. Mechanisms in regular programming (named functions, compound types, tests) can help manage the new, unconstrained landscape. So programming is interested in spreadsheet creators even if they aren't interested in programming.</p>

The designs are procedurally generated. The UI, instead of only showing you just the final form, also lets you simultaneously display intermediate forms and alternate designs, which is great. Hiding the code and showing the sketches also seems like the right choice.</p>
<p>How well does the Loglo UI succeed at the task for which it is designed? (Part of) the essence of spreadsheet's success is duplicating the best features of an already existing paper technology. To judge Loglo, I would look at artist sketchbooks. Eg, consider this image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLwp2MIuJRs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLwp2MIuJRs</a> There are two intermediate forms on the left, and the final result on the right. The explanatory text beside each image is kind of like the "code". If you play the video, the first page of the sketchbook hides the explanations <em>behind</em> the images, which you have to open up like greeting cards. This seems like a metaphor for hiding the code behind the image until you request to see it, in a UI.</p>
<p>Visual artists prefer to organize their ideas in 2D space (this is a lesson I learn from the extreme popularity of node+wire visual languages for graphics, relative to text languages, and from looking at sketchbooks created by visual thinkers). Requiring all of the sketches to fit into equal size cells on a regular grid seems like a limitation of Loglos. I think you'd want to organize the sketches on a 2D canvas, and allow for different intermediate forms to have different sizes, depending on their importance and internal complexity.</p>
<p>Loglo shows you a series of intermediate forms generated by applying successive operations in a pipeline. That's valuable, but I would also want the ability to display a collection of forms generated by the same function with different parameter values.</p>

One hypothesis I'm mulling over that contradicts the video: I actually think direct manipulation tools have a higher learning curve than programming languages. For example, once you know one programming language, it's fairly easy to jump into another. Whereas I'm expert level in Photoshop (worked as a designer primarily using Photoshop for almost a decade), but I still find Illustrator extraordinarily difficult. I'd have a far easier time leveraging a programming language I barely know like Python, than trying to accomplish something in Illustrator.</p>

You're right I don't think that they're very similar. But that doesn't refute the larger point (and arguably is in favor of it?): That direct manipulation tools aren't easier to learn than programming languages. I.e., once you've learned one programming language, it's much easier to pick up a second one, that's not so with picking up a second direct manipulation tool. I'd also say that learning a first direct manipulation tool (of the complexity of a Photoshop or Illustrator), is probably fairly close to getting an initial working knowledge of a first programming language (for a non-programmer). Overall I'd say learning the first programming language <em>is still harder</em>, but the difference is close enough that you wouldn't choose a direct manipulation tool over a programming language just because it's easier to use.</p>

E.g., see these vector speed runs and think about how long it would take to write out an SVG by hand. <a href="https://bjango.com/articles/iconspeedruns/">https://bjango.com/articles/iconspeedruns/</a> I'm just guessing, but it wouldn't surprise me if a fast user of the direct manipulation tool were 100x faster than someone fast at writing out SVG by hand.</p>

There's an interesting question of use and compositionality.  I mean awareness of the set of tools in your pallet is like awareness of a programming language's core constructs.  Just because you have all the pieces, doesn't mean you know how to use them.  How to use a loop with brakes to <em><u> vs how to use, I don't know, selection feathering, and blending to </u></em>.  Certainly programming languages have a preference toward abstraction that is not so characteristic of design tools.  (Though here are some of the more CADy ones where you do generally build new tool or presets or whatever they call them to abstract.)</p>

I feel this disregards all of our data visualization efforts. I don't think we have a saying "A picture speaks a thousand words" for nothing.</p>
<p>This blog post is likely to take perhaps 5000 bytes of storage, and could compress down to maybe 2000; by comparison the following 20-pixel-square image of the silhouette of a tweeting bird takes 4000 bytes
This comparison is so hard to make. Do we need to add the bytes fetched for all glyphs? Doesn't that bird take just a couple hundred bytes when encoded as svg? Comparing information like this seems weird to me. Also: It's not even the same information he is comparing! He compares his blog post with an image of a bird. It is now up to the reader to gauge the amount of information in both. I feel like that one is just a hard argument to follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More abstractly, I don't buy the argument in the context of about node-based graphical interfaces: The article argues not <em>replacing</em> text with something graphical, but I almost every visual interface includes text. Few people try to <em>replace</em> text. Most people try to <em>augment</em> it. Whether that augmentation adds something or not is an entirely different argument, that I don't feel is talked about in the article.</p>

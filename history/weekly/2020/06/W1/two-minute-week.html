Each chunk is prefixed by its purpose. There are drawing blocks of various kinds, and then plain computational blocks (which are just simple functions in other languages).  There are horizontal slice/scroll chunks, vertical slice/scroll chunks, grid chunks, and freeform drawing chunks each of which is a green box, and then computational blocks are represented by circles. The icons are a hint as to the purpose of that chunk of code. Drawing blocks carry a graphical context, an implied DPI and variables.</p>

&gt; This is my two minute week update for Glance. Itâ€™s May fifth twenty twenty, and Iâ€™ve got two things to talk about. Firstly, Iâ€™ve been working on a presentation about what problem Glance is attempting to solve, why that problem is worth solving, and it proposes a plan for how we can attempt to solve it. I plan to share this presentation within the next day or two. The second thing is that I have started investigating how to make a GUI for Glance, by which I mean a visual programming editor that will generate Haskell. Right now Iâ€™m evaluating the GUI toolkit GTK because it has Haskell bindings. The existing Glance code creates diagrams using the Haskell diagrams library, and I should be able to render these diagrams in GTK using the Cairo or GTK backends for the diagrams library.

I should do that for the individual apps at some point, but I don't have that yet.</p>

In this video I mostly show the output of the synthesizer with 3 different sound setups.  Adding the effects units make things fun to play with!
I didn't mention the technical aspects much in the video, but I've been working/thinking about:
â€¢ How to manage the data structure to represent the timeline of note events.  I have a prototype that involves a linked list of timeline events, allocated from a memory pool which is thread safe.  It seems to work OK, but it is ongoing research.
â€¢ Bugs!  I had a significant bug with the 'widen' button on the master output.  That just adds a small delay to the right stereo channel.  Every time I turned it on I would get audio corruption.  I eventually realized that this was caused by the spectrum analyzer(!) which was reading the graph 'too early' and breaking the 'history' buffer of the delay module.  As I also mention in the video, I have an audio glitch which could be one of several things, but is most likely caused by the new effect modules. 
Hopefully this week I'll find time to get to the bottom of the audio problem and try to add a LFO to add more interesting sound effects.  Now I have a large palette of units, I also want to try writing some 'ugens' to make synthesizer graphs.
The current graph layout matches a synthesizer I have for my iPad, as I've mentioned before - Audio Kit Synth One.  This is great because I can try to reproduce sound effects from that synth; but I want to move on from that and create my own layouts - since at the heart of this design is the idea that live coders can build synthesizers to match what they want to create and tweak them 'live'</p>

The Stereo Pan is doing some oscillation between R/L stereo, but the phaser is a different effect.  As I've said before, the audio stuff is new to me, and I'm using the simple 'SoundPipe' 'c' modules.  Phaser is described here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaser_(effect)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaser_(effect)</a>.  The phaser code I call is here:

<p>I think several of the core concepts of the paper are totally reasonable, like how state and control make a system complex, and how functional/relational programming can help alleviate these issues. I see the most useful parts of the paper as an elaboration of the paper ‚ÄúWhy Functional Programming Matters‚Äù.</p>
<p>In that context, OP‚Äôs critique seems off base because it doesn‚Äôt address what I see as the substance of the theory.</p>

It required commitment and a willingness to go outside their comfort zone.</p>
<p>I believe, the community has been self-selected to consist of those who are not bothered by Smalltalk's 
initial limitations, and so are unmotivated to address them or support those who do. In fact, they often 
could not even see these limitations staring them in the face, causing them to adopt unrealistic 
business policies that hurt them more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Perhaps an even deeper problem with Smalltalk is that it attracts people who are a tad too creative and 
imaginative; organizing them into a cohesive movement is like herding cats.```</p>

<p>I find the message of <em>The Lisp Curse</em> mich more useful then the slightly whiny article about Smalltalk. I had never looked at what comes with the power of being able to fit the whole programming system into your head ‚Äî when you alone can do anything, there‚Äôs no need for collaboration. But to build something that is appreciated by many, you need the diversity of a team.</p>

<p>There is one aspect missing in the Lisp Curse, and also its Smalltalk variant: both languages predate the Internet. Before the internet, collaboration was difficult to establish. Both finding collaborators and interacting with them was much more difficult than it is today. I suspect that this is why Clojure escaped the Lisp Curse, in spite of sharing all the features that were supposed to encourage it in Common Lisp.</p>

The arguments in favor of the new languages often revolve around increased expressive power, or conciseness, or new buzzwords. But to businesses and government entities which provide most of the employment in the field, their overriding concern is for stability, and transferability. Time and time again, the industry consensus has been to select the worst, most verbose language available, that had the perception of being easy to understand. LISP, which permits, some would say encourages, very sneaky metalinguistic abstraction practices, is well known to be  "write-only" language, so regardless of its positive attributes has been shunned for 50 years (and probably rightly so). Python has crept up into the top 3 due to merit; it is reasonably compact, and reasonably easy to read.</p>
<p>I used Modula-2 which was the 10 year later sequel to Pascal. It was superior to C in every single aspect except popularity. It generates faster, smaller more compact, more readable programs, and its feature set has 100% correspondence with C, and adds dozens of error-reducing compile-time and runtime checks against dumb errors like nil pointers, array bounds checks, and conversion errors. I could not get a single person to convert to Modula-2 in 20 years because everyone was in thrall to Microsoft's dominance. Whatever MS did was the law, and people were afraid to buck the behemoth's practices. Now i look back and see the probably close to 100,000 security patches that have had to be applied to MS's code base, all because stupid C doesn't have NIL pointer or runtime range checks. The amount of wasted time spend downloading and installing these patches, none of which would have been necessary had MS used a more robust language.</p>
<p>And let's not forget that the people working as programmers many of which are paid by the hour, have a perverse incentive to use the most troublesome language available. Programming is one of the few fields where people are paid full wages to fix their own errors. A building contractor, when he screws up, often has to pay with free labor to fix their mistakes, while programmers typically earn 75%+ of their total income from fixing their own mistakes. Not a pretty picture that one.</p>

I used Modula 2 as my main language on the Atari ST eons ago, then switched to C because the people I worked with insisted on using C because everybody uses C.</p>

Of course these where complex interactions but I think the business model thing is a nice example of a structure and function thing. Open Source is a structure to serve a function from society. I think it exemplifies the strange but important relationship between technology and people. We created institutions like computer science or computer industry but it is very difficult to interact with them. The sheer distance from paying taxes to a published research paper to working piece of software using ideas from research is simply too vast.</p>

3. While connecting a wire, the valid ports should be highlighted to help the user identify which is the correct port to connect.</p>

All MIT, so feel free to harvest. Relevant code is here: <a href="https://github.com/cdig/svga/tree/v4-1/source/nav">https://github.com/cdig/svga/tree/v4-1/source/nav</a></p>
<p>Main zooming/scrolling logic is in <code>nav.cofee</code>, with the other files handling each different kind of input, mapping it into the domain I care about. We support zooming/scrolling with:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ 1 finger scroll and 2 finger pinch zoom on mobile
‚Ä¢ arrow keys to scroll, +/- to zoom
‚Ä¢ mouse drag to scroll, wheel to zoom
‚Ä¢ trackpad drag to scroll, 2-finger scroll to zoom
‚Ä¢ trackpad pinch-zoom in safari and FF
‚Ä¢ touchscreen windows 1-finger to scroll (can't remember if zoom is supported)
‚Ä¢ programatic control using custom GUI, etc
‚Ä¢ other stuff I'm forgetting
If you want to play with a simulation that uses this framework, here's a free one on our website: <a href="https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/fixed-variable-displacement-pumps/efficiency-of-different-pump-designs-simulation">https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/fixed-variable-displacement-pumps/efficiency-of-different-pump-designs-simulation</a></p>
<p>There's a lot of complexity in getting this to work, and it also explicitly ignores some cases we don't care about, so I'm not sure if it'll be helpful. At the very least, it's an existence proof that you can cover most kinds of input in a way that should allow everyone to scroll and zoom in a way that feels fairly comfortable.</p>
<p>If you do end up rummaging through this code and have questions, feel free to DM me if you want to keep the noise level in this thread low.</p>

And so thus one can copy/paste GUI operations. Very few products go to this length but then 3D is a very complex world with lots of scripting that goes on, hence the need for this.</p>
<p>Photoshop has a similar facility they call the "Actions", and you can script fairly complex sequences with relative ease in their system. Editing the scripts is a bit clumsy ,and of course there are all sorts of file path issues that crop up, as you are often saving to different folders, and it can get confusing as to which folder is "current" when you are changing folders so often as one does in Photoshop Actions.</p>
<p>Top of the line GUI products have history palettes, and these two products are among the many that give the GUI super powers. Command line interfaces are bankrupt at this point. No excuse for them any more; just a hangover from Unix which is archaic as well.</p>
<p>That being said, for highly frequent operations, it is provably faster to use the keyboard, as the human hand has 10 fingers while a mouse movement uses up your whole arm, so in terms of bits per second, the keyboard trumps the mouse easily, and anyone concerned with the overall data rate from the user will invariably seek to keyboardize whatever operation they are doing. It was a tragedy when the industry adopted the 12 function key DEC keyboard layout over the far superior 10 function key to the left IBM AT keyboard. The function keys to the left were super easy to reach reliabily, while the 12 keys at the top hardly anyone knows by heart. That cost us a lot of data rate, because we needed the function keys on top of the alphabet to create keyboard interfaces that sung.</p>

&nbsp;
We would like to invite you to participate in a programming challenge as part of a research project. For the last eight years, we‚Äôve worked on the Webstrates (<a href="https://www.webstrates.net">https://www.webstrates.net</a>) software platform as a way to explore
software that‚Äôs inherently malleable and collaborative. In our team, we‚Äôve
worked on various iterations of tools for developing software with Webstrates
and now we have something that we think is pretty neat, but we‚Äôd love to get
some input from you.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The programming challenge is to <em><em>make a small multiplayer game where the players can change rules through programming</em></em> using our <em>Codestrates v2</em> development platform. The challenge will run for a little less than three weeks from <em>June 10th to June 26th</em> ending with an online demo session <em>Friday the 26th at 15.30 CET</em>.
The programming challenge is open-ended, but expect to spend the equivalent of a couple of evenings to work on it. You can work on the challenge by yourself or in a group (all members should sign up). To participate, you are expected to have experience with Web development and JavaScript programming. We don‚Äôt expect that you have experience with game development but it‚Äôs fine if you do.
We assume games to be publicly shared under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) unless otherwise is agreed with you.
&nbsp;
You sign up for the challenge here: <a href="https://www.survey-xact.dk/LinkCollector?key=HCPGJP41UK9J">https://www.survey-xact.dk/LinkCollector?key=HCPGJP41UK9J</a>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<em>Sign up before June 8th at the latest</em>.
&nbsp;
If you sign up we will contact you with further instructions, access to our
system, and to a Slack workspace where all participants can chat and ask for
help. You can at any time opt-out of the challenge.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
For us this challenge aims to:
‚Ä¢ assess the creative potential of the Webstrates &amp; Codestrates tools.
‚Ä¢ evaluate the usability and understandability of Codestrates &amp; Webstrates.
‚Ä¢ get input for the future development of the platform
&nbsp;
For you, it‚Äôs an opportunity to contribute to science by playing with some software that hopefully inspires you and challenges you to think of software
differently. We cannot compensate you for your time, but we can provide you
with an exciting experience.
&nbsp;
Our goal is to publish the results of the study at an academic conference or
journal.
&nbsp;
Feel free to share this invitation personally to people you might believe are
interested, but we ask you kindly not to distribute it broadly, e.g., on social
media or the like.
&nbsp;
Best
regards,
&nbsp;

For example,
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; "foo" ++ "bar"
"foobar"
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]</code>
The above REPL session shows a language where numbers, strings and lists print as constructor expressions.</p>
<p>I don't <em>think</em> this requirement is in conflict with simplicity and malleability. However, Lisp dialects (languages with S-expression syntax) do not meet this requirement for lists, although they meet it for numbers and strings. For example, quoting from the Wart paper,
```1 + 1
‚áí 2</p>
<p>'(1 2 3)
‚áí (1 2 3)```
Philip Wadler wrote about how this causes problems for teaching Lisp to undergraduates:
&gt; The difference between (1 2 3) and (quote (1 2 3)) is subtle, and it inevitably confuses students. In particular, it plays havoc with the substitution model of evaluation.

But the topic here is syntax, which I think is not explained in sufficient detail on your page.</p>
<p>Apparently you are trading in simplicity for "normality" in the sense of allowing familiar infix expressions. The price to pay is a distinction between standard identifiers and infix operator identifiers. OK, but what are those rules? Is it by character class, as in Smalltalk? Some characters are only allowed in infix identifiers, and others only in standard identifiers? With mixing forbidden? Then... how do you handle the creation of synthetic identifiers in macros? Stuff like Lisp's gensym.</p>
<p>Another detail that is unclear is the indentation analysis. What would be the parenthesized form of
<code>def foo</code>
    <code>foo bar</code>
  <code>foo bar</code>
(assuming this is legal syntax?) That's where edge cases tend to get messy in various indentation-based proposals I have seen.</p>

<p>The rule for inserting parens is: <em>Multi-word lines without leading parens are grouped with later indented lines.</em> That's it. I work through some implications at <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/004optional_parens">https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/004optional_parens</a></p>
<p>To tweak your above example a little to make it legal code:
<code>def (foo)
    prn 1
  prn 2</code>
Now <code>(foo)</code> prints:
<code>1
2</code>

Yeah, disjoint character classes. The major restriction is that you can't use <code>-</code> in variables, which is a bitter pill to swallow. (Mu gave up Lisp to get back <code>-</code> üôÇ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't follow the gensym question. Wart expands <code>$x</code> inside macros to something like <code>x1234</code>. But it doesn't support infix operators. Is that what you're wondering? It never occurred to me to create new infix operators inside macros.</p>

This property goes by several names: compositional semantics, composable syntax, "the substitution model of evaluation".</p>
<p>The corresponding syntax in Lisp is <code>(list a b c)</code>. So, print <code>'(a b c)</code> as <code>(list 'a 'b 'c)</code>. But that's very verbose compared to the usual alternative. In Lisp culture, <code>(quote a)</code> is so important that it is abbreviated as <code>'a</code>, but there is no abbreviation for <code>(list a b c)</code>. So let's make an abbreviation, and use <code>[a b c]</code> as an abbreviation for <code>(list a b c)</code>. So now we print <code>'(a b c)</code> as <code>['a 'b 'c]</code>.</p>

<p><code>&gt; (list 1 2 3)
'(1 2 3)

'(1 2 (3 4))</code>
I have ambivalent feelings about this 'feature', though.</p>

But there is more:
<code>(let ((fn (make-symbol "foo-bar")))</code>
 <code>(eval </code>(progn (defun ,fn () nil)<code>
               </code>(,fn)))`
This must raise an error at some point - but where? Do you disallow making mixed symbols? Using them as function names? Calling the misnamed function?</p>
<p>My point is that in a language with Lisp-style meta-programming, any constraint on syntax percolates down to lower layers, with hard to foresee consequences. And that's why s-expressions are so hard to replace, in my opinion.</p>

That leaves symbols requiring an explicit quote. But with the new list syntax, you have also broken homoiconicity a bit. Suppose you construct a list which you then turn into code by feeding it to <code>eval</code> : your list constructor now has a different aspect than code written by hand.</p>

It's just more inconvenient to call. If you create the symbol using <code>make-symbol</code> (or <code>sym</code> in Wart), you have to also refer to it the same way.
<code>(eval `(def (foo a b) (let ,(sym "a-b") 34 ,(sym "a-b"))))
(foo 8 9)
=&gt; 34  # args are ignored</code>
Does this seem like a big problem? I've learned to expect that metaprogramming is a sharp tool that can get one in trouble.</p>

And continues with "Mainstream adoption will, however, always be curtailed by the syntax.". I think that Sweet-Expressions fails at the goal of finding a syntax that makes Lisp acceptable to the mainstream, and I think this failure is due in part to not having a full understanding of what the problems are with Lisp syntax (from a mainstream perspective). The proposal's author boils down the issues to (1) a lack of infix notation, and (2) too many parentheses, which can be fixed by indentation as syntax. This is not the complete set: the Philip Wadler paper I cited earlier discusses additional issues.</p>

Mainstream languages print values as constructor expressions. Lisp prints values as the code that would be executed by the evaluator, if the value was passed to <code>eval</code>. When I suggested how to fix Lisp, <strong>Konrad Hinsen</strong> replied that "you have broken homoiconicity a bit". So this is a tradeoff in syntax design. Lisp syntax is designed to make metaprogramming easier, <em>at the expense of</em> making ordinary, non-metaprogramming more difficult.</p>

Any identifier can be used as an infix operators. Initially, I followed APL and Smalltalk in adopting a no-precedence left-to-right evaluation (APL is right-to-left). But then Shriram Krishnamurthi pointed me to the approach he had taken in his Pycket language (designed for teaching), which I adopted immediately and so far without regrets.
The rule is simple: an expression with more than one infix operator requires parentheses for disambiguation. So, no precedence, nor left-to-right. The one exception is a chain of identical infix operators. So you can write <code>2 + 3 + 4 + 4</code> , which is parsed left-to-right. The net outcome is that you can read expressions as if they used traditional maths rules, but you don't need to remember precedence rules. And due to the same-operator exception, the number of parentheses remains very reasonable.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p> When you look at code from a data-centric view, a lot of things start to look like stale or inconsistent data problems. I don't like using the word "cache" for this because it focuses on the negative, the absence of fresh input. The real issue is data dependencies, which are connections that must be maintained in order to present a cohesive view and cohesive behavior, derived from a changing input model.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>In short, by putting a lot of responsibilities on the data model you can make the UI code for the editor a lot simpler. This is really important to us, because one of the problems we had in Bitsquid/Stingray was that we spent <em>a lot</em> of time on developing UI and tools. Sometimes we would spend 30 minutes to add a feature to the runtime and then a week to create a UI for it. In The Machinery we wanted to address that imbalance and make sure that we could write tool and UI code as efficiently as runtime code.

<p><em>How Do We Fix it?</em>
Automate undo, copy/paste, etc with a well-defined data model
Less busy-work
Minimize and own the tech stack
Make things explicit and easy to understand
Avoid changing frameworks
Control performance
Reuse UIs and generate them automatically from data
Properties, Tree, Graph, etc
Don't have to create an UI for everything.</p>

I feel like I don't know what I don't know. I think it's about not knowing <em>what</em> is possible to use as a notation for documentation. For example, I am working on an application right now that uses an Entity Component System to manage "business logic" and as such, there are multiple representations of the same data that are possible, the "Serialized model" which is shared with other systems, and the live model which lives within the component storages. What is a good way to document these different ways that we manage the same data? Similarly, some applications have a "Domain model", "Database model", and an "API Model" for the same concept like a "Delivery Route", do notations exist that can quickly communicate the relationship between the "Delivery Route" used in the database, versus in the Domain model, versus the API Model? I'm not sure...
I feel like it's an "unknown unknown"â€“Like I don't know that something exists, therefore I don't know how to look for it.</p>

Ryan Stinnett: </span> <p><p>I'm working on some approaches to extract sub-page/window frames out of existing apps. These frames would then exist as separate windows locally which you could arrange however you prefer, and can also be shared with other people, snapshot for archiving, etc. It would be a huge help to hear what people might want to use this ability for, so I recently tweeted to collect some feedback. Happy to have replies in a thread here or on Twitter, whichever you prefer.</p>

Not so much how would I use this, but what is table stakes for me using this. I have a strong emotional reaction to this idea (or my understanding of it).
[Non-quote to collect my scenario:]
&gt; I picture a rectangle select happening on an app or a web app, and then having a rectangle primitive that I can work with (maybe itâ€™s a window on its own, maybe I combine it with other stuff). This seems like it could be super powerful. But that is not my dominant reaction. My reaction is dread. Dread for the moment I go to scroll and my scroll gets picked up by the wrong layer and now my widget is broken. And then I spend hours/days/weeks looking for a solution to this, only to discover that the app designer is handling scroll events in a way that makes it impossible. 
I assume that something like this would be finnicky and fragile. I think making it <em>not be</em>, and <em>convincing people</em> that itâ€™s not going to be is an important problem. I think remixing apps is an important goal to work towards, but I personally would have a high bar for robustness.</p>

I think it could be quite an enabling, powerful tool / primitive, but only if you can be confident it will work the way you expect when first extracted and remain working thereafter.</p>

I will caution you that some of the big boys in the business such as Facebook spend a great deal of their time obfuscating the graphics and texts that are on their webpages so as to make it as difficult as possible to scrape. Facebook goes to perverse levels of obfuscation and concealment to the point where they even hide their crappy Little user interface icons, and theyâ€™re not even drawing them as JPEGâ€™s or PNGâ€™s from a link location. When you have engineering devoted to blocking people using the information programmatically So as to induce people to enter contractual relations to obtain the data directly such as Facebook does, you are techniques will hit  these kinds of barriers. </p>

<p><strong>Edward de Jong</strong> for the record, thatâ€™s exactly what iâ€™m talking about! so far the code also works on facebook (donâ€™t have time to redact all the personal data, so no video) and almost works on twitter (at least for text content extraction). one upside is that the technique works as long as they maintain a tree structure in the dom that mirrors their presentation objects. it doesnâ€™t really care about class names or the data types of things. just makes it easy to identify normalized relationshipsâ€”give me every element thatâ€™s at the same position with respect to its local tree, if that makes sense.</p>

Are your findings based on (existing) research? I am building a visual programming environment myself and try to map it less directly on textual program language commands although some nodes in the flow perform very simple taks like checking a condition or performing an assignment. I want to abstract away certain bigger tasks inside the nodes themselves (which can be extended by plugins)</p>

Not really. My supposition that
<em>The visual programming complexity ceiling exists because</em> visual syntax becomes large and cluttered when representing large programs 
and the semantics of the visual language do not support sufficient abstractions.
is a bit of a simplification, and there are other problems with visual programming that aren't mentioned. Also, there are some visual languages that are general purpose ("support sufficient abstractions"), but it's uncommon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposed solutions are not directly based on research.</p>
<p>There has been some research comparing the understandability of visual representations vs. textual representations. The paper "<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/publications/aire.pdf">Cognitive Factors in Programming with Diagrams"</a> has an overview of some of the older research.</p>
</p></div><div id="2020-05-30T15:06:07.238Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-05-30T15:06:07.238Z">2020-05-30 15:06:07</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Edward de Jong: </span> <p><p>I read your slideshow with great interest. One thing I would like to caution you about is that the example you chose the fizz buzz program is far too small a task. If you measure length of programs by counting the words, in the textual version a task like fizzbuzz is so near zero words that it doesnâ€™t provide any information about whether or not the graphic of notation is helpful at mitigating complexity. In my Beads project samples I show a ramp of difficulty starting with a clock and going to TicTacToe, minesweeper, to chess, and then to the start of an IDE. Chess is over 1000 words, and is an excellent small test, as it combines both graphics and somewhat complex rules. I suggest you pick a task to program that has enough complexity that it cannot be represented on one screen and directly confront the central problem we are trying to solve. Which is how to make something more understandable then textual format does. If you limit yourself to trivial examples you will generate a false positive on the value Of your graphical representation. Even TicTacToe is hard enough that your diagrams would get A little messy. So I think you should Avoid basing your examples on a task too simple.  Another example thatâ€™s too simple is the to do list, which is often presented to show how simple a new language would be, Any example based on data entry Fields is inevitably going to hide the million lines of code that goes into properly handling a multi lingual text entry box. operating systems exist just to handle the text entry box, Because the intrinsic complexity of rendering Truetype fonts and input method editors for Asian languages, and you are talking thousands of man-months, all concealed in the underlying layers.</p>
<p>You can pick a graphical task or a business task or a Database kind of task, but whatever task area you do select for your example, please be sure it has enough intrinsic complexity to go beyond what can be shown with a dozen nodes.</p>
<p>I would also caution you that a goal of delivering "an easy to read visual representation of Haskell" is probably an oxymoron, because there is nothing that easy about reading Haskell. Some of Haskell's fancy features like currying are of negligible practical value, and make it very hard to read, because now you have to know at all times how many arguments a function expects, so you can tell the difference between passing a function pointer with a missing arg, or calling a function. Nothing easy to read about that feature; it is pure poison to a reader and for that reason i rejected it instantly as a feature in Beads.</p>

In terms of the readability of Haskell, I do see the project moving beyond Haskell after Step 0 to a simpler language. Partially applied functions however, are something that a visual editor could make explicit. For example, ((+) 1) could be displayed as ((+) 1 O) where O represents the missing argument.</p>
<p>On a side note, I don't fully understand your criticism of currying. Are you talking about reading code that you know is correct, buggy code where you suspect some arguments are missing, or code you are in the middle of writing?  To paraphrase your argument, with currying you don't know if the type of (f x) is a plain value or a function. But that ambiguity exists in any language where functions can return functions.
U0123H7JRDM I'm presenting it as a research project, although if successful I could see it inspiring commercial projects. My goal is to create something general purpose, so right now I'm not targeting a specific domain. My plan is to start by dogfooding it by developing Glance using Glance, and once all of the obvious bugs are fixed pick a substantial project to implement.</p>

<p>This week I wrote about using JSON as a lingua franca, it's an productivity technique I've been dogfooding for a couple of years.

<p>Writing it was surprisingly hard. I LOVE this idea, but after using it for so long, it feels so obvious. I have no idea how else I would solve the problem. If someone was reading this, why wouldn't they jump out of their seat? Isn't this so great it doesn't need explaination? Of course it does. And I need to develop a better sense for the reader's mindset to make more valuable content.</p>

I thought it was just a 2minute weekly update in any medium. I didnt see anything explaining the rules so thank you for clarifying. I happily took down my post.</p>
<p>In <strong><code>#meta</code></strong> though I would like to discuss having a Textual weekly update channel. Its cool seeing what people are up to and text is easier to skim than a video, and its nice to have a forum to articulate this week's learnings.</p>

<p>I want to see <strong>Tyler Adams</strong> ' post now.</p>

If you feel like you can put a neat spin on the format, I encourage you to start sharing your weekly posts in <strong><code>#general</code></strong> and encouraging others to do the same. If interest picks up, then I'd be happy to spin up a new channel.</p>
<p>As for the two-minute-week rules, they are linked under the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/community">channel listing</a> on our website, and <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/two-minute-week">linked directly</a> from the channel description in Slack. It'd be nice to find a way to make them more easily discoverable, so ideas are welcome.</p>

I think the neat spin is discoverability. Having a central channel here allows me, and other newbies, to better discover new Future of Coding's interesting ideas. I'll post my next update next week in <strong><code>#general</code></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Duncan Cragg</strong> Check in next week on <strong><code>#general</code></strong> :)</p>

<p>I'll modify the question â€” are all the effects coming from libraries, or have you implemented some of them yourself?</p>
<p>I'm curious to see how you do the GUI for the LFO.</p>

The infrastructure of Nodes and the data management is mine,  but a lot of it winds up calling a simple 'c' function from soundpipe to do the processing inside the compute part of the Node.  SoundPipe is great - it has very small c functions that just do one thing, and they are ported from CSound mostly.

Some units, such as the Oscillators beside it have buttons to enable modulations by the LFO; which is connected via a pin to the node.  The buttons toggle which of the 2 LFOs are used.</p>

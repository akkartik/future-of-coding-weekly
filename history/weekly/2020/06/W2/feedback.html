I know how much work it can be to put diagrams like that together. I have similar feelings as <strong>Edward de Jong</strong>, in that I would worry the examples are too low level. The majority of "business people" (for example) who need to program are not doing complex math with reducers or functional programming. So, I would really conceptualize the kinds of problems you want your language users to be able to solve. At my company, we are building a textual language which operates at a far higher level like
<code>once daily (at: 9am):</code>
    <code>(@Postmates) (send) (item description: "Any kind of flowers") (to address: üìç324 Madison)</code>
Parens would not be necessary in our editor and our language is a bit richer allowing you to use things like <a href="http://like%20this">links</a> to reference variables.</p>

Ambiguity is the enemy of comprehension, and in any language where you can't tell if something is a simple function call or instead a function that returns a function without checking the tail end of the parameter list, creates a difficulty in reading that is just not worth it. It means you have to know when reading the exact parameter list of every function call you see. Given that larger programs are mostly function calls, this imposes a significant memory burden on the reader. The idea of long sequences of positional parameters is an archaic notion dating back to FORTRAN, and is also not readable. I adopted the Smalltalk practice of using optional named parameters, which was also used in Objective-C. It is much more readable. Always a tradeoff between full named parameters and positional; i have adopted a mixed approach because they can get annoying.</p>

1. This presentation ignores a lot of research on visual programming languages. Specifically there is a large focus in current computing education research on transitioning from a visual language to a text based one gradually (some with real quant and qual behind them)
2. Haskell‚Äôs currying exists because all functions take a single argument. But if you wanted to address the issue you mention, you could color each ‚Äútype‚Äù in the signature and show the result under the type variable (with parens as boxes) so you can keep track (like rainbow paren for LISPs). I believe Haskell treats modeling the problem (and determining sig) as the hard part and it usually means implementations are ‚Äúsimple and obvious‚Äù (to those that really know the stdlib). Typed holes in purescript did wonders for me when I was learning (though it didn‚Äôt help with heavy aliasing)</p>
<ol start="3"><li>I really like the idea of keeping the learning curve flat, but there is always a dropoff. Also, good pedagogy goes a long way towards keeping learning curves flat as a crutch to design.</li><li>If you are really focused on developing a first language, I recommend you actually practice it on people, document/record the pedagogy (ethically), and keep track of how people are actually modeling the problem in their head as they build conceptions, test hypothesis, and develop the dreaded misconceptions. It works for frameworks too :) Also google scholar the rainfall problem :)</li></ol></p> <div class="msg-files"></div></div><div id="2020-06-04T19:44:39.290Z" class="alert alert-dark msg-response p-2 ml-1 my-1 bg-light"><span class="small text-muted"><a href="#2020-06-04T19:44:39.290Z">2020-06-04 19:44:39</a></span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Cole Lawrence: </span> <p><p><strong>Robbie Gleichman</strong> also a heads up, on the visual programming side, <strong>Ivan Reese</strong> has a pretty nice collection of visual programming tools that might spark more inspiration for your work!

I'm training a neural network to translate abstract syntax trees into images (and then back into ASTs since the whole system is an autoencoder.) Right now this is limited to simple arithmetic statements like <code>c / (a+b)</code>, but the goal is to try it out on larger expressions with a greater vocabulary, so that you can turn larger ASTs into images. In addition to being really fun and interesting, it feels like it could offer ideas for visual programming?
Visualized here is an interpolation between different expression trees. Still kind of rough around the edges.</p>

<p>Creating anything in the digital space is a two way street: Human to computer and computer to human. This work clearly falls under the human to computer, as does NeuralLink and Kernel. They solve the bandwidth interface issue as well as some complexities in translation (i.e. the act of physically programming or diagramming). These products satisfy one aspect of the future of coding as other products satisfy the other: how do humans understand/read/organize/explore what they created?</p>

Beyond that the returns start diminishing quite quickly. I believe this so strongly that I disable highlighting for most things but have 4(!!) colors of comments based on different leaders. (I also like to highlight early exits: <code>break</code>/<code>continue</code>/<code>return</code>.)</p>
<p>And then I find the colors I save to be occasionally useful for highlighting individual variables <em>on demand</em> but <em>randomly</em> and <em>persistently</em> (across restarts), giving me a sort of synesthesia where I start to expect certain variable names in certain parts of a codebase to be colored a certain way. Invaluable for highlighting dataflow and side-effects.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of screenshots from various points in the past that show off all these features. (I love talking about this topic but often repeat myself.)</p>

&gt; Experimentation plays an essential role in exploratory programming, and programmers apply version control operations when switching the part of the source code back to the past state during experimentation. However, these operations, which we refer to as <em>micro-versioning</em>, are not well supported in current programming environments. We first examined previous studies to clarify the requirements for a micro-versioning tool. We then developed a micro-versioning tool that displays visual cues representing possible micro-versioning operations in a textual code editor. Our tool includes a history model that generates meaningful candidates by combining a regional undo model and tree-structured undo model. The history model uses code executions as a delimiter to segment text edit operations into meaning groups.

It‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôve never liked source code control systems because it‚Äôs extremely rare to undo work. Understanding the implications of making changes to code it is really at the crux of the future of computing. Can you make it so that someone can easily understand the implications of what they‚Äôre about to change? This is why strong typing It‚Äôs so important because it helps the reader understand what could go in a variable. In 99% of the code each variable is going to be used a single way. Users name is never going to become his age. The name is always a string, and it‚Äôs only point is to mostly disambiguate a human being from another. One of the problems with these editor Features is that it is not recording why you made the change, so you have this branching tree but you don‚Äôt know why you did what you did, so it isn‚Äôt that useful.</p>

<p>I don't know if re-mixing and open standards are important here or not. Except for iMessage (haha) all the others work everywhere and are free so if someone says "contact me on X" I just install X. I think it's likely to get worse. If you believe in the acceleration of change then before you can standardize something it will become irrelevant? Like there was a SMS standard. Who still uses it (I'm sure India or some place like that still uses it). My point is a 140 character standard has mostly been supplanted. Next we need images in our messages. Then we need video clips, then live voice, then live video, tomorrow we'll require shared AR or shared VR or something.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Web is pretty good at remixing. Iframes and other APIs let me mix stuff from all over.</p>

There's a bit of a catch 22 here. Most new VP tools are made for non-programmers, or are created by small teams with tight constraints. As a result, these tools aren't appealing to existing programmers, which reinforces the myth that visual programming isn't for <em>real</em> programmers.</p>
<p>I think one recipe for a breakthrough VP tool is:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Borrow heavily from video games ‚Äî modern graphics tech, time manipulation, high visual interest, tight latency, fluid feel, engrossing first-run / self-tutorial, and insane polish
‚Ä¢ Focus on advanced programmers, not beginners
‚Ä¢ Focus on expert users, ensuring they can fly through the tool like experts can fly through Photoshop or Modo
‚Ä¢ Don't make it easy to drop down to text
‚Ä¢ Focus more on interactive performance than execution performance
(I have like 20 more of these things that I see as "reasons current tools are bad", but they get increasingly.. weeds-y)</p>

<p>Mostly, I think node-and-wire programming hasn't <em>tried</em> to be generally successful and is happy with being used in limited contexts.</p>
<p>Consider python, a 'generally successful' programming language. It can be used to program embedded systems, write web servers, script game engines, and script 3d modeling tools like blender. It's widely used for scientific computing and data processing. There's some things you might not <em>want</em> to do with python, but there's nothing you <em>can't</em> do with python.</p>
<p>Compare that to the most successful node-and-wire systems. They're always tied up in some complex runtime. I can't copy Unreal Blueprints into Max MSP the way I could copy python from a web server to a Blender script.</p>
<p>It feels like node-and-wire systems are in the same place scripting languages were in the 90s. Every application has its own bespoke node-and-wire system. None of them are very high performance, and none of them work together.</p>
<p>Often, there's no library ecosystem for node-and-write tools, and even if there were an ecosystem, every platform would end up re-implementing the same libraries.</p>

<p>Which is to say, node-and-wire tools need to reach all the way down the stack (there can't be a moment where you need to leave the node and wire system to use the more powerful tool 'underneath') and they need to reach across the stack - a node-and-write tool that only works for one very particular use case will never have the general success that a tool like C# has.</p>

My guess is that node and link programming expressivity is limited. I mean it is extremely expressive for some programming artifacts (say, audio processing, event flow, etc.) but very poor for some others (math expressions first come to mind, but I need to find mor examples). So I guess a language that is exclusively based on nodes and links won't be able to be general enough for major success.</p>

In the broad sense, it's definitely possible to create a powerful, wide spectrum visual programming language that scales as well as text only languages. I would start with the principle that code has a hierarchical structure (like a syntax tree). Each node in the tree has potentially multiple different visualizations available, depending on its type, and you can flip between different visual syntaxes. You can create different visual DSLs for different domains (eg, music sequencing languages use different visual conventions than 3D graphics languages). And you can mix multiple DSLs in the same program: these are just different node types.</p>

<p>Node-link makes effective use of the link image schema (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_schema"></a><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_schema">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_schema</a>). Such schemas are universal patterns that structure our thinking on the lowest levels. These patterns also provide the infrastructure for spoken and written language as well, so they sit both under visual and text-based languages. (If ‚Äúsitting under‚Äù makes sense to you in that previous sentence, that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an example for a spatial metaphor build on top of image schemas.)</p>
<p>Node-link languages work well, because they hook into that particular link pattern which we all intuitively understand. That‚Äôs where their power comes from. Unfortunately, one pattern isn‚Äôt enough to model everything. However, it‚Äôs great when it‚Äôs almost all you need in the domain you are modeling for.</p>
<p>Some node-link languages add a second image schema by allowing containment. The container schema is also why files and folders and directory structures are so pervasive. That‚Äôs a little more expressive, but two patterns are still not enough to model all the complex things general programming languages can.</p>
<p>Where node-link languages break down is: they usually offer no solution to the problem of anchoring things to locations. It usually doesn‚Äôt matter where you put nodes on an often infinite canvas. Location has no meaning, like it does in a map, or a scatter plot, where each dot is precisely tied to a location. </p>
<p>While placing things arbitrarily on a canvas sounds positive like flexibility and freedom, it creates cognitive effort because we will quickly feel overwhelmed placing large number of objects in a space without any supporting structure. So we invent that structure on the fly, trying something like ordering nodes by data flow, which works well enough for when you‚Äôre just modeling how data flows through a number of filters and transformers. But often we end up with conflicting structures. That‚Äôs when we start talking about how it all looks like spaghettis.</p>
<p>For some reason media apps are good at taking advantage of image schemas and metaphorical structuring, which I believe is all happy accidents simply because these patterns are how we think and when designing UI we gravitate towards them even if we don‚Äôt know why. </p>
<p>Think waveform visualizations in audio recording software or MIDI notes. X-axis is often bound to time giving position meaning ‚Äî the same reason why charts and diagrams are often easier to grasp: image schemas giving rise to powerful spatial metaphors.</p>
<p>That media apps seem to discover these schemas is less of a coincidence and connected to how we understand media as events spread across time (yep, guess what‚Äôs the basis for that‚Ä¶). In general programming we think much more abstract and have many completely incompatible orderings at the same time, e.g. data flow with concurrency, static type hierarchies, hierarchical stack frames, sequential memory ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to visualize each one of them at a time, but it‚Äôs essentially just different views on the same system.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we can deliberately take advantage of this particular knowledge in cognitive science in UI design and ultimately for designing better ‚Äúvisual‚Äù languages. If you see any research that‚Äôs combining these fields, please send it my way. And if you want to learn more about the cognitive science parts feel free to contact me. I‚Äôm happy to provide plenty of pointers to resources I can recommend.</p>

‚Ä¢ node and wire diagrams tend to prioritize a bunch of things but very rarely have clear points of view on visual hierarchy (in the graphic design sense). so it‚Äôs hard to see which 1-4 things are of primary interest when looking at an expansive diagram
‚Ä¢ they don‚Äôt tend to have super-robust notions of focusing in on a particular eg function or object. i think there‚Äôs a lot of available blue ocean space for tools that let you filter down to a compact representation of what you‚Äôre working on and its immediate dependencies
‚Ä¢ visual display of data structures: node and wire diagrams tend to do a lot for visualizing where data comes from but not a lot for what your data is shaped like or what operations are available for that data shape. this is particularly weird to me because data formats, whether json or haskell, tend to be pretty visual in ascii-land‚Äîcontainers for stricter or maps represented by {}, or strings with quotes, or even the idea of ordering fluent OOP interfaces where something.operation.secondOperation(arg1, arg2) usually means ‚Äútake a thing AND THEN do operation AND THEN do second operation and stick these arguments INSIDE second operation‚Äù

&gt; In both blocks and nodes editors, the interaction loop boils down to summoning a node and then connecting, or placing, it into context. This ends up being a very verb-centric model where you get the <code>+</code> node/block and then wire it up. This is like painting off to the side, moving it to the correct location, and then blending it into the rest of the painting. While there are times where that flow is useful, it‚Äôs much less direct than just painting in place and requires tedious actions inserted in the middle. Going from two steps to three for every action in a system adds up quickly and makes even the most basic operations feel heavy in these editors.

As for layout, I don't want a visualization that "must be laid out by hand with great care" [Ivan], because that's a big waste of my time. In the Go language community, they have this culture where you don't format your code by personal preference, there is only one true layout, enforced by the gofmt program. I want to use code visualizations where there is automatic layout, and there is only one way to lay out any given program. Different layout means different meaning. I don't want to "burn" interaction gestures on manual layout. There's only so much convenient interaction syntax available, and it must be used wisely. If I move a graphical object from one position to another, it shouldn't be because the object looks prettier in the new position, the gesture must change the meaning of the program (like moving a MIDI note up and down in Stefan's example).</p>

<p>Overlooked in all this talk about whether and how positioning has meaning: manual layout is meaningful to the author, for the sake of their own thought process, that the environment doesn't need to care about.

You choose the names, and it's worth spending the effort to choose great names, because that's how you structure your thinking about the problem.</p>
<p>In other words, the formatting of text code and the layout of visual code are not directly comparable.</p>

Inventing names for trivial things is a pain. One of the killer features of node+wire programming is that you aren't forced to choose names for local variables. Choosing names for important high level concepts, or using 2D layout as a way to organize important high level, is beneficial. But don't make me manually lay out the nodes for 'x + y + z'.</p>

<p>In fact, like most people coming from text languages I was frustrated to have to always use the mouse with Max/MSP, and as someone that once tasted the power of vim, I was <em>really</em> frustrated.</p>
<p>So I experimented that in my "zed" editor where (nearly) every action can be done "easily" with the keyboard: in my <a href="#C0120A3L30R">two-minute-week</a> video of last week I only use the mouse to move in the canvas, all (the few) editing/navigating actions are done with the keyboard. For example hitting "a" then "s" adds a script node just below the current node, then hitting "i" connects the node input to the output of the previous, etc.</p>
<p>I agree this kind of manipulations is reserved to power users, but as Ivan previously said it is important to make things work fine for power users and it shows that if the mouse is seen as a complicated way to edit/navigate one can also imagine some easier way to do things.</p>

Agreed! No <em>good</em> node editor would make you do that. (There is a paucity of good node editors.)</p>
<p>That said, <code>Vec3.add(x, Vec3.add(y, z))</code> is bad too ‚Äî&nbsp;and it's common in languages that don't have operator overloading. But operator overloading isn't a total win either, given precedence is typically fixed (good luck using <code>^</code> for the geometric wedge product). So in the end, you still often have to manually lay out your equations, just using extra verbosity instead of extra cabling.</p>

Show me an example of one that doesn't make me do that. The problem with node+wire is that once you add a node to the canvas, it is stuck in that position until you move it. So what happens after you have written a substantial amount of code, and need to revise it? Suppose I want to insert 'x + y + z' into the middle of a computation, but it won't fit, there is no room on the canvas to put those nodes where I want. So either I manually rearrange all the nodes to make room for the new code, or I put the new code off to one side where there is space, and drag input and output wires from the place where the computation needs to be, off to where I put the nodes, and now the code looks like a plate of spaghetti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's why I want automatic layout. If I insert nodes, the code automatically reflows to make room. If I delete nodes, the code automatically reflows to fill in the gap.</p>

3d modelling tools have solved this problem without automatic layout. They give you rich tools to manipulate objects in space, and the space itself, by leveraging the properties of the structure of objects and space.</p>

<p>Want to insert something in the middle of a dense mesh? Grab a vertex and spread out new vertices along every inbound edge, turning the original vertex into a face ‚Äî&nbsp;in 1 keypress + click. Or, slice a plane through the mesh, and push both halves of the mesh apart. Or, band-select all the faces pointing toward the camera, and pull them away from all the faces looking away from the camera.

<p>There are, also, automatic tools you can use. But the manual modelling tools are so good, you rarely want to use the automatic tools. (This gets more weedsy when talking about animation, UV mapping, mesh sculpting, etc. ‚Äî those areas have manual+automatic hybrids.&nbsp;But they're also less about putting things in places and more about setting relationships, which is relevant to us, but not relevant to this question.)</p>

<p>(There are a bunch of node-and-wire tools that let you put JavaScript or C++ or whatever inside a node. I view that as cheating. There are some node editors, though their names escape me, that do have dedicated equation nodes. None of them are especially rich.)</p>

In the communities that use these languages, dense code is highly valued. Because this allows you to put a large program on the screen in its entirety, and read it without scrolling. APL was invented in the late 1950's, and there has been 60 years of work on achieving ever higher code densities. So now you can put the logic from 10,000 lines of C++ code in two pages and read it without scrolling. The claim is that once you surmount the steep learning curve, you become more productive. You can write a page of C code in a few keystrokes. There is less use of libraries: the attitude is that if the name of a library function is more keystrokes than inline coding the same logic using language primitives, then you should use language primitives instead.</p>

Using URLs to short-circuit onboarding is something I hadn‚Äôt thought about and would be extremely simple to do. And I can already see so many uses for this, not just to get people to a specific part quickly, but also to trigger certain debug/support actions, because I can totally schedule a call with a user, send them a link, and ask them, ‚ÄúHey, can you click that link while we‚Äôre on the call?‚Äù Which could also trigger some sort of data model migration, ha!</p>
<p>Re migrations: I‚Äôm probably using JSON and dedicated model structs just for import/export. Then I can add properties whenever I want and handle larger structural changes in the actual data structures one level higher, with a lightweight migration transformation that only has to work in one direction.</p>
<p>A lot of the other things you mention are also good for onboarding in general. In hindsight kind of obvious that what I was asking for is somewhat related to onboarding.</p>

I didn't know about makespace but that looks great too.</p>
<p>The main thing that struck me about Mercury isn't just the clean UI but that the software is organized around 'app-free intentions aka flows'. All operating systems (iOS, Linux, Windows) are very app oriented. Mercury provides your 'intention' or 'workflow' as a concrete organizational model. Typically you jump from app to app to app to acomplish a given intention - the thread of intention just lives in your head, but nothing connects the corresponding windows on your screen. Mercury solves this.</p>
<p>Check out this 'flow' of a single intention (getting coffee with a friend) that spans multiple apps - nothing like this exists in any mainstream OS: <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*0hAZt7GMWzgSjSDK5VBwCA.gif"></a><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*0hAZt7GMWzgSjSDK5VBwCA.gif">https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*0hAZt7GMWzgSjSDK5VBwCA.gif</a></p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> to create threads that connect snippets of information across multiple 'apps' - all are related to one intention. Unfortunately what I do is just reframe a calendar view or mail view I already have open (for one purpose) to another purpose. I end up with a cluster of app windows with different purposes all mixed together. Not at all ideal, but something we're just used to I guess.</p>

<p>What's stopping you from moving faster?
The scenario I was thinking of: I often want to do some big fuzzy thing, and I realize just how big it is after some false starts, and start to think harder about decomposing into smaller pieces. So what I initially thought was going to be a single commit eventually turns into a series of commits. And in the process my understanding of the problem becomes much more precise. "What tooling can get rid of the process of clarifying one's understanding?" feels as hard a problem as "world peace".</p>
<blockquote><p>.."this feature adds too much complexity"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's stopping you from adding more features? ... feels more like a language/tooling smell
I'm thinking here about the principle of parsimony in design. There are two ways to add a feature. One yields a state space of size <code>M+N</code>, another of size <code>M*N</code>. The extra complexity in the latter isn't needed for its purpose. Again, no tool is going to help you with this sort of problem until tools become sentient and turn us out of jobs.</p>

<p>More strongly, I make the case in my recent paper (<a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf">http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf</a>) that <em>all features have costs</em>, and end-user computing requires making end users aware of these costs, so they can better decide if they need them. "Zoom's going to start a webserver on your computer which adds a little convenience but a lot of risk. Yes/no?"</p>
<p>Tools for handling problems later.. just, no. Say you're building a prototype, and you don't care about a bunch of things. There are still things you need to get right <em>that will otherwise pollute the signal you're hoping to get</em>. No tool is going to substitute for the imagination needed to anticipate how your A/B test might get messed up. With all the attendant slow-down and context-switching overhead that each such bug causes.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear now that my original prompt was abysmally unclear. Hopefully this helps clarify things.</p>

What I was getting at is the distinction between using synchronization primitives and <em>having to reason about synchronization</em>. Every time I create a shell pipeline I use synchronization. But I don't need to think about it. Do programmers need to think about or appreciate synchronization more than they do today? I'm not yet convinced. And similarly for many of your other axes. They're the stuff of CS degrees, sure, and I have a CS degree so I'm closer to them than most. But they feel like accidental complexity in most situations.</p>

In this case I have a few more thoughts that may be useful:
 * Designing a language to purposely help increase the understanding of the problem would be interesting. Maybe allowing for both specific -&gt; general (like TDD) and general -&gt; specific (like Haskell type declarations before impl). Idris and type-driven development is one angle that's interesting here, and rust/elm/purescript+typedholes also leads devs to have a "conversation" with the compiler as well. (FWIW, I'm fairly ignorant of Mu so unsure what opinion it takes here, if any).
 * M<em>N situations do arise sadly. Most of abstract algebra and category theory is about describing ways to simplify and (hopefully) efficiently compose these cases. I believe that tools can help us with these, such as statebox, but the barrier to entry feels pretty high still. I worked on this a bit at Invision too (fun exceptions when nesting state machines that non-programming designers needed to be able to "configure"). [Side note: M</em>N problems are particularly annoying to represent in a linear view like text-based languages.  There's fun stuff from the category theory people on diagrammung multi-dimensional composition "easier" but I haven't seen non-math nerds be able to develop intuition around them yet. ]
 * Delaying complexity until later is super important to prototyping quickly. The problem is <em>knowing</em> that you skipped over something and if you are "polluting your signal." I believe the sweet spot here is gradually typed languages, though I'd say they have mixed results in terms of lowering complexity so far. I'd bet that AI would be able to "fill in the blanks" sooner than they could design the skeleton.</p>

<p>For starters, mining just the code has limited value because there are many properties of a program that someone reading it can (laboriously) deduce that don't actually exist in software.

Repeatedly recomputing it would be almost certainly cheaper than a database lookup.

(Go with me here ‚Äî resist the urge to treat this as a multidimensional space.)</p>
<p>In the center, we have projects that resemble typical programming languages. These tools are designed with particular semantics that the programmer will employ to structure their problem solving. They are general purpose. They don't have much regard for the particular kinds of problems being solved. This is your Java, Clojure, Vulkan, brainfuck, etc.</p>
<p>Off to one side, you have programming tools that have both tightly defined semantics and a focus on solving particular kinds of problems. These are specialized. This is Excel, Notion, Max/MSP, OpenGL, bash, etc.</p>
<p>Off to the other side, we have programming tools that, while they still have semantics, don't expect you to work entirely within those semantics. They have even less regard for the problem domain. These are tools that expect you to first build some new tools from or within them, then solve your problem with those tools. This is Racket, and arguably REST, RDF, stored procedures in a DB, and other things.</p>
<p>Now my question: are you building an FoC project that falls into the latter category? If so, talk about that a bit. What's the rationale?</p>

<p>The idea is that the history of visual programming is full of unsuccessful attempts (for an "incomplete"/old list see for example: <a href="http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/"></a><a href="http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/">http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/</a>). So I feel that finding and designing the "good one" from start is quite hard and will most certainly miss essentials features. So I want to provide some core functionalities that are enough to build complete things but also let some other visual tools emerge from actual usages.</p>

<p>Given that spectrum I guess I fall into the latter extreme, because I think the power that programming gives to programmers is to improve their own process and often through building their own tools (albeit ‚Äútool‚Äù here can have a much broader definition). If you can program, you can make computers do things that regular people can‚Äôt make them do. </p>
<p>To democratize access to that power, a great alternative to teaching everybody how to code is to instead make building things easier. And I still believe that is very much possible, because we currently live deep in just one specific branch of the solution space which was strongly influenced by the needs to not just create things, but to satisfy certain success metrics (revenue, popularity, engagement, etc.).</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why we can find so many promising ideas closer to the trunk of the tree in the papers of the 60-80s, when using computers was much closer to programming them, and when visions were mostly driven by imagination and less warped by specific incentives.</p>
<p>The most important reason for giving people the power to build their own tools instead of building them for them is that they know what they need best and I will never be as good as them to really understand what they really want or need. They might not understand it fully themselves. That‚Äôs why they need to build it themselves. They need to invent it themselves. They need to discover solutions on their own. And to do so, they need to have the power to do that. And that needs to be simpler than it is today.</p>

I think I underspecified the last category. I was hoping the examples would make it clear, but in the cold light of morning yadda yadda.</p>
<p>As I said in the reply to Nicolas, I'm interested in thoughts/work at the paradigms &amp; semantics level. Tools that are designed to be a scaffold for language (or "programming system", though I dislike the term) experimentation. As a node-and-wire example, it'd be an environment that may include nodes and wires, and some execution strategy that covers what to do with those nodes and wires, but that doesn't expect you to stick with that execution strategy. You can (and are encouraged to) define what it means to be a node or an edge ‚Äî&nbsp;to turn <a href="http://puredata.info">Pure Data</a> into <a href="http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/">PANE</a>. You can decide that there are no edges.</p>
<p>When someone like Rich Hickey <a href="https://clojure.org/about/history">creates</a> a Clojure or a Datomic, this is the level that he's thinking at: What semantics should Clojure have, and why? I'm interested in tools that are designed to support working at this level. I don't know what to call them, or how to even frame them.</p>

Even if it can stay at the "new datatype or function" definition level, the real plus is to allow the user to tell what to do with the information in the visual representation.</p>
<p>So, one can define some nodes and wires representation for a build system, where rounded boxes defines files, squared boxes for bash building rules and links for dependencies, and that this produces a <code>Makefile</code>. Someone else might use something similar but to produce a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. And a third one will have the rules in something else than bash (maybe another visual?) and that it is plugged directly to a "live" customed building system (maybe a serverless infra).</p>

In your system, the programmer defines some data or a function and binds it to a certain graphic ("rounded boxes defines files, squared boxes for bash building rules"), which is akin to binding symbols/identifiers to functions or data in a text PL, and then the programer decides which of those graphics to invoke in various contexts and at various times ("links for dependencies") much like writing the main() function. That means what you're designing will be a peer to a traditional general purpose programming languages, whereas most visual languages currently aren't even designed to be that powerful.</p>
<p>But what you can't do <em>within</em> C or Java is change their semantics. You can't change the way code is executed, not without changing the compiler/interpreter (at which point, you're no longer making a typical C or Java program that'd work with any C compiler or JVM). You can't turn C into a lazy evaluated language. At best, you can use C to create a new language that is lazy evaluated.</p>
<p>An example in a hypothetical visual language where code is tree-structured would be: can you, working entirely within the language, decide whether execution is "pushed" from the root node down, reevaluating every node as it goes, or whether execution is "pulled", starting from a leaf and evaluating back up to the root?</p>
<p>Another example ‚Äî a visual programming environment in which you can define the "grammar" and how it's parsed. So you could build an execution strategy that makes use of color, or that makes use of proximity, or that makes use of the fineness of detail. You aren't saying "round boxes represent files", but rather "roundness of corners is a semantic detail, so whenever a corner is rounded, here's how to interpret that". For instance, you could say that shapes should be evaluated in order of roundness: circles come first, roundrects second, and boxes last.</p>
<p>Another example ‚Äî&nbsp;a node-and-wire environment where you can control whether edges simply associate something on one end with something on the other end (as like a function call), or mutably remove a value from storage on one side and insert it into storage on the other side (as like an inbox/outbox), or are themselves mutable storage (as like a queue).</p>
<p>I think what you've described is a big improvement on what currently exists. But it doesn't feel like it fits the (admittedly, <em>very</em> poorly defined) region of concept space I'm trying to map out. I wish I had better theoretical PL chops so I could know what, if any, terminology to use here.</p>

But the idea is really to try to give the maximum opportunities to users to define some visual representations and what they means in terms of behaviors. So ultimately, all your examples are really good illustrations of the kind of things I would like to allow the users to do. I agree, my examples are too simple: only mapping visuals to text languages, I definitely want to go further!</p>

<p>These could allow a fair bit of diversity in not just what kinds of tools emerge but what kinds of paradigms emerge as well.

<p>Would you say Unix is such material - (tends to be flexible in terms of what the static structures and dynamic processes mean). Unix with byte files and OS processes provides some structure for static/dynamic structures but within that we have a wide variety of programming paradigms.</p>
<p>Another example maybe could be apparatus? (<a href="http://aprt.us/"></a><a href="http://aprt.us/">http://aprt.us/</a>)</p>

I mean, that'd be cool, but it depends what one's goals are. That's why I'm curious to see what folks here are doing that might fit this jello mold (as in a mold made of jello) ‚Äî&nbsp;what rationale might one have for wanting to force <em>so much</em> responsibility onto the user?</p>

<p>Yeah, Unix probably counts as something like this, in that it's a "thing that sits under my compiler and generally doesn't force my compiler into a particular paradigm". But on the other hand, it's not exactly like you are building your language paradigms out of the pieces unix provides. Unix is just there to facilitate reading, writing, and executing. So in that sense, it might even be too far to that latter extreme of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I think the VPRI connection was the best fit, so far, for what I have in mind. So ‚Äî who here is taking another crack at that chestnut?</p>

In my vision, the idea is not to force the user but instead give this ability to those who want/need it. I.e mainly  power users. And once a user has create an expressive visual representation it can be shared to other users that can use it without having to take this "responsability".</p>

For example, in the case of a data structure, if you have visual primitives that match your data primitives, you could potentially combine those visual primitives in the same way you combine the semantic primitives. i think it‚Äôd also be important to start with something smaller than, say, java.</p>
<p>At a minimum, we‚Äôre doing our best to keep all this complexity in our heads using naming things for our existing systems, which work ok (for a sufficiently cynical definition of ‚Äúok‚Äù)</p>
<p>On the other hand, we track a lot of visual primitives in everyday life. In the common case with languages like english that are made up of letters, cognitive studies show that we tend to read words sort of like individual gylphs (wihch is why you can raed wrods werhe the ltetrs are jmuebld according to Many Memes). and with experts using systems, like airline pilots, mathematicians, and carpenters, people seem to have a facility for remembering thousands of things provided that they have a context where theyre using them often. Or even in games‚Äîfor example, most hearthstone players have all of the cards and their effects memorized by picture just as a side effect of playing the game. more so for magic the gathering, where the smallest set of allowed cards for tournament play is usually around 2,700</p>

I remember products requiring a Light Pen, boy was that lousy technology. Software that requires hardware narrows your audience terribly. It also prevents people from trying it out on a 30 day trial, because they don't own the pre-requisite hardware. History has not been kind to software with this requirement. The Wacom tablets are used by most of the artists I know, because they have a tilt sensing in the pen, and it has really high precision. The Apple pencil is different technology than Wacom, and doesn't have tilt compensation. But it is pretty good, and much cheaper than the Wacom. Apple has the ability to bump the refresh rate up on their iPad Pro tablets, an obscure feature that few realize exists. So far, nobody has beaten the Wacom Cintiq system for overall artistic feel. There is also the friction coefficient, which Wacom cares about. Apple has a glossy surface which doesn't "bite" well. An artist's time is very valuable, and having the best equipment is cheap in the larger scheme of things.</p>

Techniques like offloading tasks onto another thread that may cause you to miss hard real time deadlines is how game engine physics and game AI have been implemented for years.</p>

Here are some quotes I took from my reading of the book:
1. I use the term ‚Äútool‚Äù broadly enough to include not only simple hardware such as drills, pots, syringes, brooms, building elements, or motors, and not just large machines like cars or power stations; I also include among tools productive institutions such as factories that produce tangible commodities like corn flakes or electric current, and productive systems for intangible commodities such as those which produce ‚Äúeducation,‚Äù ‚Äúhealth,‚Äù ‚Äúknowledge,‚Äù or ‚Äúdecisions.‚Äù I use this term because it allows me to subsume into one category all rationally designed devices, be they artifacts or rules, codes or operators, and to distinguish all these planned and engineered instrumentalities from other things such as basic food or implements, which in a given culture are not deemed to be subject to rationalization. School curricula or marriage laws are no less purposely shaped social devices than road networks.
2. A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence.
3. Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon. To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools, the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a convivial fashion.</p>

1. Computers are tools that make us smarter (as individual users), that "augment human intellect", in the words of Douglas Engelbart. Computers serve the needs of users.
2. Computers are tools that exist to serve the needs of the oligarchy and the state. The role of users is to be exploited by the corporations that create, own and control the technology. Cory Doctorow's blog and the <a href="http://EFF.org">EFF.org</a> (Electronic Frontier Foundation) are working to publicize this trend and organize resistance against it.</p>

But companies are a kind of living thing, they need to obtain energy in the form of money to keep their staffs going, and so inevitably you then see ruthless firms like Facebook who intensely data mine so as to generate an income stream. If people would pay a fair price for the services they use, the companies wouldn't need to resort to tricks to find revenue on the back end. You don't see Adobe Creative Cloud users getting mined like this, because they are paying a subscription fee, and Adobe thus doesn't need to do this kind of thing. But the minute you make a service that actually costs hundreds of millions to run free to users, then you are going to have some invisible revenue generating mechanism, that might be highly detrimental to your privacy or have other non-obvious negative effects.</p>
<p>Asking something for nothing is my definition of a jerk. Yet people now have been trained by savage firms to expect this, and it is quite unfortunate.</p>

Every new technology creates a space for a more geopolitical way of thinking to come to the fore. (Not everyone does it, but those who do find surprising opportunities.) The original age of diplomacy was about the implications of oil. The age of Fascism was about mass media. We're currently exploring the implications of software infrastructure. Firefox and Adobe don't have a fixed pecking order when it comes to virtue. Each can do things that <em>align more</em> with one group or another. Our periodic angst about Slack is also a sign of relying on something whose provider isn't aligned perfectly with us. In that situation it's easy for alliance to slip into exploitation. (And I use both words without any connotation of good or bad. It's worth thinking of them as just different parts of a single state space.)</p>

As a long time user of Adobe's Creative Suite, one cannot lay all of the problems with breaking changes on Adobe. Apple has deliberately broken with each successive version of OSX the super important CS series. OSX 10.14 breaks many of the apps, and OSX 10.15 kills off all 32 bit apps for no good reason other than to force you to buy new stuff. When you pay over $1000 for software, you plan to keep it working, and i personally hate subscription model software when it is a program i use perhaps once a month. Most of us are not practicing artists, and Adobe is creating the competition that may eventually damage them severely. But i also have to point out that other big companies in the software field have always been envious of Adobe, and have at times gone to war against them, spending resources to hinder or destroy them.  They have also been massive victims of piracy in the past, and the OS vendors did nothing to help them. The iTunes App Store is the first piracy free ecosystem for the PC, and it has flourished. Cheating ruins the game of capitalism, and there is so much cheating today that people are souring on the concept of capitalism. Mutually beneficial exchange of goods and services is the foundation of modern civilization, but many entities figure out it is cheaper to rig the game than to do more for less, which is the promise of ever higher technology.</p>

<p>If you want to have people voluntarily give you large amounts of money preferably on a regular basis, you can either deliver value that one decision maker in a company can justify (B2B) or you deliver value that consumers want to pay for (B2C), which is a lot easier if you sell bits together with atoms.</p>
<p>If that‚Äôs not your thing, or you want ‚Äúeveryone to be able to use it‚Äù, you make it free and find other ways to get paid for the value you create. That can start with harmless ads, but then often spirals into selling data about your users to advertisers because targeted ads make so much more money.</p>
<p>If you build something customers pay you for directly, you need to keep pleasing them by adding value; you need to keep innovating. Then everything that holds you back is in your way.</p>
<p>If your users aren‚Äôt your customers, you optimize for other things. Then your software just needs to run and you care a lot less about what it runs on, as long as it‚Äôs still functional and users are still using it. Better yet, you might even optimize for staying around on older platforms for longer to maximize reach.</p>
<p>I do believe that it‚Äôs ultimately good that we have these very different approaches, as they somewhat keep each other in check. I also think that free (as in beer) software has done a lot more harm than good to our software ecosystems.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting is that a lot of people in our industry who supposedly understand software very well, want things to be stable for eternity but at the same time always use the latest technology and don‚Äôt seem to see any problems with that.</p>

<p>My hobby language of choice is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. Nim is a much more traditional programming language in many ways. It exposes the "code as data" / macro features by essentially providing you with the same AST data structures that the compiler itself uses. Macros in Nim are "compiler plugins" in a very concrete way. This has it's own pros and cons and gotchas.</p>
<p>Not many "big syntax", non-homoiconic languages are able to do this. Rebol/Red is one of the few in this category that can.</p>
<p>Ruby and Smalltalk arguably achieve similar things, but in a different way. They push more semantics into the runtime via OOP and message passing.</p>

<p>It's pretty hard to beat lisp on flexibility lol.
If you look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/chaitanyagupta/9324402">lisp reader macros</a>, and Racket with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext">it's many DSL's philosophy</a>, I think you will see the same level of flexibility, just in a different form.</p>
<p>IMO this is not a case in which one solution is strictly better or more powerful than another. I have a hunch that many macro, DSL generation, "code as data", and "programmable programming language" ideas are isomorphic to each other and are fundamentally equivalent.</p>
<p>It comes down to taste, and which solution you prefer on a practical level. I think this is an example of the phrase "there are many ways to cook an egg..." (replace with equivalent phrase from your childhood here üôÇ ).</p>

Nenad is running the project. They have funding (done via a Crypto coin offering), and they have very active community on Gitter. They don't visit here at FoC at all. I occasionally pop in and kibitz. Anyway Rebol is effectively a language where each function is its own domain specific language.</p>
<p>It is fairly jarring to those coming from Algol family languages. They use colon (:) for the equal sign, and parameters to functions, which they call refinements, are prefaced with a slash /. They use a clever feature to distinguish type name spaces, a type name has an exclamation point afterwards like rect!, and then you can tell if a name is a variable or is it a type name. I've considered imitating this feature, it solves a lot of namespace collision issues.</p>
<p>There are various libraries which go way beyond what a Python library does for example, because it is a whole domain specific language. Red can be justly proud of its "Parse" module, which approaches the pattern matching power of Icon, the king of string manipulators.</p>
<p>The Red team is focusing on crypto contracts, but it has a GUI library that can make interesting things. Any dynamic language like LISP or Red abounds with user created custom languages, and learning the subtleties of those languages is not easy. I personally find that the dynamic languages create a memory burden on the reader, as the reader must have in their mind the domain specific language. For very bright people, these languages are attractive, but the high leverage achieved in these languages means that small changes can have drastic effects. Leverage works both ways.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to create ever more powerful stacks of function by long sequences of domain specific languages or function composition, i have tried in my Beads language to create compartmentalization, where a section of code's possible effects are constantly being narrowed, so that a mistake in a module can only have a local effect, and thus the overall system is more robust.</p>
<p>CSS is an example of a language i consider maddening, because an extra or missing character can cause a baffling scrambling of a page's layout. This type of fragility is not friendly to maintenance. PHP has a similar fragility to it, because it is typically generating HTML/CSS code, and thus doubly fragile. For this reason PHP is losing its luster.</p>

I'm curious about how you achieve this. It reminds me of this research project, <a href="https://github.com/melt-umn/ableC">AbleC</a>, in which they try to create a C compiler that supports extensions / plugins that could be proven to have only local effects in much the same way.</p>

It starts getting problematic when someone starts with "using the notation introduced by X in referende Y ...". If you have to read another paper first just to parse the notation, it becomes a chore.
So perhaps a good solution is PSL (problem-specific language) rather than DSL. A very local scope for the language. In Lisp terms, one or two short macros that readers are expected to read and understand, rather than a complex language extension packaged as a library (which is what Racket advocates).</p>

The original post was about Rebol, and I was talking about Rebol, not Red. Rebol and Red are different.
There are two kinds of Lisp dialect.
‚Ä¢ In the Macro dialects (modern compiled dialects like Common Lisp and Scheme), there are no FEXPRs. Instead, there are Macros, which receive their arguments as unevaluated syntax objects. There are two phases of evaluation. Calls to macros are expanded at compile time, not at run time. Macros are not first class values. 
‚Ä¢ In the FEXPR dialects, you have FEXPR objects, which are like functions, except that the arguments are unevaluated syntax objects. FEXPRs are first class values. There is only one phase of evaluation: calls to FEXPRs are evaluated at run time. These dialects are interpreted, not compiled. Older examples are Lisp 1.5 and 3Lisp (these are historical dialects, not used today). A newer example is the Kernel language, a dialect of Scheme with FEXPRs instead of Macros, with multiple implementations on github: <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html"></a><a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html">http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html</a>
Everything I said about FEXPR Lisp dialects seems to be also true of Rebol, and everything I said about Macro Lisp dialects seems to be also true of Red. So that is how I am categorizing Rebol and Red, pending more information. This page from the Red language site seems to confirm what I just wrote: <a href="https://www.red-lang.org/2016/12/entering-world-of-macros.html"></a><a href="https://www.red-lang.org/2016/12/entering-world-of-macros.html">https://www.red-lang.org/2016/12/entering-world-of-macros.html</a></p>

I don't know enough about Red to answer this in the Red context, but I can talk about my own experience. My Curv language has exactly 2 levels because Curv can be either interpreted on a CPU, or it can be compiled into GPU shader code and run on a GPU. The run time requirements for these two execution environments are quite different. On the GPU, I can't have a garbage collector, or first class function values, or general run-time polymorphism, whereas on the CPU, I can. So any Curv code that runs on the GPU is restricted to a statically typed subset of Curv. This statically typed subset is upward compatible with the full language, and GPU code can be executed on the CPU without any ceremony, so it feels like you are programming in a single language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Red language is claimed to be suitable for writing operating systems. You don't want to have a garbage-collected runtime environment inside an operating system kernel, because garbage collection pauses are incompatible with real time programming. For example, you need to be able process interrupts with guaranteed latency bounds. From <a href="http://Red-lang.org">Red-lang.org</a>, "<em>Red/System</em> is a C level language, where you are responsible for allocating and freeing memory, and where you may need precise manual control over those actions."</p>
<p>I know that the Lisp machine operating system was written in Lisp. I don't know the details, but it seems plausible that they would have used a statically typed Lisp subset for low-level OS code (device drivers and such), which if true, would put Lisp machine Lisp into the same category as Curv and Red (two levels, including a low-level systems programming dialect).</p>

I do wonder how Lisp machines got around garbage collection at the lowest level though. In the Lisps I know, there is no opt-out.</p>

<p>You're right that I'd been clumping Rebol and Red in my mind. After your comment I went back and reread <a href="http://blog.hostilefork.com/rebol-vs-lisp-macros"></a><a href="http://blog.hostilefork.com/rebol-vs-lisp-macros">http://blog.hostilefork.com/rebol-vs-lisp-macros</a>, and I still want to push back on your statement that "Everything I said about FEXPR Lisp dialects seems to be also true of Rebol." The notion of definitional scoping turns out to also exist in Rebol, and it has a huge impact on how Rebol operations evaluate their arguments.</p>
<p>It's a very fruitful exercise to compare and contrast different programming models. Saying, "A is just like B" flattens a lot of the richness, I think. Even if an idea was "invented by Lisp first," there's still been lots of parallel evolution that has converged in surprising ways. Rebol is worth framing as its own thing, on the same order as Forth. It's not a Lisp derivative.</p>

They are unstructured arrays of bytes and one is constantly having to decode and encode files. Apple used to use a thing called a resource fork which was a secondary structured section of a file, in which to store indexed meta information. it was wonderful, tut because the Internet was based on stupid old unix and couldn't transfer files easily, they dropped it. And Microsoft had taken 10 years to copy that feature in a version of their file system called WinFS, was just about to release it and then they dropped it too, pushing us back to the 60s.</p>

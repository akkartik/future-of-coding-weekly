<strong>Kartik Agaram</strong>'s Mu as well. I have some similar history. I learned the very basics of hardware in college, I have followed Ben Eater off and on since he started, and a few years ago I became really invested in the (now semi-famous?) <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a> course, which I still love. I just never had the time or energy to take those ideas to the next level and actually do my own project. It's inspiring for me to see other people going for it!</p>

You talk about wanting to hit 1080p at 60Hz and supporting modern displays. How are you thinking about physically getting the video signal out? Are you planning on implementing your own HDMI controller?
I'm curious because I looked at the HDMI spec once and got very overwhelmed lol.</p>

<p>I think your idea to iteratively level up is a really good one! push that nonsense off as long as you can 🙂</p>

<p>You are purposely ignoring pre-emption and you obviously aren't doing any SIMD, but if you squint, it looks similar. Especially at the Streaming multiprocessor level.</p>

<p>I am interested why you didn't choose to have something like string literals for "Who is online?". To me this phrase could be interpreted like the second half of the program - as a command to fetch online users.</p>
<p>How do I write the program where I shout out usernames, and Alexa responds with either  "online" or "offline"?</p>

It’s very important to keep in mind that it’s not a programming language; we are not constrained or bound to parsing plain-text with a compiler — We can represent the resulting application in many ways. The adding quotations arounds a string is something we will user test after more of the product is complete as we have complete free reign over experimenting with the way the program is represented.</p>
<p>Your question about how to write an alexa skill for “Is {person} online?” would be something along the lines of</p>
<p><code>when Alexa hears "Is {name} online?"
     Slack lookup user by name
     if user is online
         reply with "Yes"
     else
         reply wit "No"</code>
<em>Note</em> that I adding string laterals here to demonstrate that we can, at any point. It’s only a css decoration.
<em>Note</em> there are no variables; we keep things in scope and the user can reference traits of things in scope without directly linking them. This may sound odd; it’s a novel approach — during the dialog-driven interaction the user will confirm trait relationships therefore not requiring: <code>user = … user.is_active</code></p>

When you present this to non-developers they have a stronger relationship and understanding to it due to their lack of knowledge of other traditional PLs. But really… how different is that statement to visual programming 🤷 which also changes the paradigm but a lot more where the “language knowledge” is almost entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p>i’ve said this before and i’ll say it again: this is the coolest part about storyscript to me: an enormous part of the cognitive load of programming is tracing dependencies back up the chain via identifiers. how much of the “compiler in your head” is devoted to a vtable lookup?</p>

There are no external processes.  This is a single executable.  I want a great 'out of the box' solution to shader and audio coding.  The challenge that this brings though is ensuring that all the threads of work inside the single binary are kept busy and performant.</p>

I found one major cause which was to do with the mixer in the audio path doing the wrong math; that helped a lot with odd sound transitions I was hearing.
If you notice, this video was recorded at 500 fps for the graphics, with my video from the webcam, and OBS running on the same machine on a 4K display.  To add to that, my machine is 'only' an i7 4 core.
I don't mention it in the video, but I also have this app mostly working on Mac.  It will be interesting to compare it, since the MBP is a top spec macine.
Ultimately, performance work is ongoing and will be more focused as I move towards open sourcing everything.....</p>

<strong>Jack Rusher</strong> If I'm honest, I'm just following my nose and having fun.  This is a side project for me, intended to be released as an OpenSource app, and a single install executable on Mac/Windows/Linux (though perhaps not initially on all platforms).  If you're asking what I would like it to be:
• A shader development IDE, featuring GL, Vulkan, DX12.  I want it to be easy to, say, test a hardware ray tracing shader, or develop a new effect.  Currently I support GL, but there are substantial portions of Vulkan/DX12 written.  I work in graphics, so there is overlap with things I've done before here.
• A music language research and development IDE.   Initially supporting something like Ixi lang.  I have considered Extempore-like functional scripting too.
• A live coding/performance tool.  Single Install.  Code a performance. 
Longer term, I'd love to play a bit with VR.  I've long been thinking about the idea of building a performance in a 3D space.  Everything you see in the tool is rendered using the graphics API; including the text editor (which, though I haven't gone into it too much, is designed to support inline graphics to represent code elements.).  That stuff is pie in the sky though.  I have a full time job, and this project fits around that most of the time; and that generally means that I bursts of productivity and then rest, depending on work volume....</p>

I'd love to support something similar.  My recent experience with the Janet language has encouraged me in that regard.  I'm already itching to build some kind of scripting into the tool so I generate some actual music!</p>

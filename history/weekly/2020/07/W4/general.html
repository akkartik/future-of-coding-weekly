Definitely sounds better in my head that yaml. Does this already exist? Is there a complication I‚Äôm missing? </p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2020-07-20T03:10:07.023Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="#2020-07-20T03:10:07.023Z" class="date">2020-07-20 03:10:07</a> <div class="message"><p>I'm curious to hear more about Pulumi. I had a similar question after looking at Hashicorp's Terraform CDK over the weekend: what's the point? It has to emit a static configuration. JSON basically. What does having a general-purpose PL buy you if you can't add a loop or conditional to the output? Pulumi seems the same, going by tutorials like <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/ec2-webserver"></a><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/ec2-webserver">https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/ec2-webserver</a>. Can someone point me at a more complex scenario that it can handle?</p>
<p>I'd like to create a host, then monitor its health for 60 seconds before creating a second identical host. Does Pulumi or any other infrastructure-as-code allow me to do that? If I'm reading it right, the declarative-code article above has the same issues with Pulumi.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-07-20T08:08:13.035Z" class="reply"><span class="user">nicolas decoster</span> <a href="#2020-07-20T08:08:13.035Z" class="date">2020-07-20 08:08:13</a> <div class="message"><p>I don't know exactly how Pulimi works, but I have some experience with Terraform (I use it on my last project as a corporate employee).</p>
<p>The point is that generally you define a desired state and ask Terraform to do all it can to create/modify the corresponding infrastructure. And for that it analyzes your code, checks that everything is OK and proposes you a "plan" which describes what Terraform will actually do: create new resource, deleting some others or just modifying some. Terraform then asks you if you want to proceed and then actually do the job. Of course, you can tell to Terraform to apply changes automatically without asking, if you are very confident about you code or don't care to break things, but generally this is desired thing to be asked because of the tricky nature of infrastructure management.</p>
<p>So I guess the scenario "create something, wait a bit, create something else" is not very common and is actually "not in the spirit". But if this use case is really needed, if I recall well there are some trick to allow doing this kind of pause. In the definition of the first resource you add a script that sleep 60 seconds, maybe with some monitoring, and make the second resource depends on this resource, which will make Terraform wait the end of the script before creating the second resource. The paradigm is to define resources and dependencies.</p>
<p>For loops, there is something that allows you to create a set of ressources with a single definition. I used it to generate thousands of VM. In fact you have a series of tools for "loop/conditionals" at the language level, but always in a spirit of "templating".</p>
<p>But after a bit of practicing, I felt sometime that I would have prefer to code things with a general purpose language. For things like getting env vars, managing some files, etc. I guess it is what Pulumi is about, and I am very curious about it.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-07-20T08:37:06.035Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Ionu»õ G. Stan</span> <a href="#2020-07-20T08:37:06.035Z" class="date">2020-07-20 08:37:06</a> <div class="message"><p>Pulumi is very much like Terraform, it actually uses the Terraform providers behind the scenes (Pulumi does not generate files, as AWS CDK does). The only major difference is that you declare that desired state using an API of a general purpose language. But otherwise, Pulumi does exactly what <strong>@nicolas decoster</strong> said Terraform does ‚Äî keeping that desired state, creating a plan, previewing it, applying it, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a>'s problem, I think the solution in Pulumi would be similar to the one in Terrraform. Define a custom resource that does nothing than just block execution for an amount of time and then to the health check, then use this resource as a dependency of the second host you want to create.</p>
<p>Going back to the original question of whether it would make sense to have a visual editor for k8s config files, I don't think it would help that much. The problem with YAML is not that it's YAML, it's that it offers no means composition and abstraction. With only a visual editor that all it does is to offer affordances for YAML concepts, things will be the same. But, if that visual editors starts adding some PL concepts, such as variables and functions, then it can be useful, but at this point I think it's no longer about YAML or k8s, it's just about structural editors in general.</p>

<p><strong>@Pete Vilter</strong> did you follow any resource for your Datalog implementation? Do you know of any tutorial-like resource that shows how to do that? I'm pretty familiar with unification I'd say, since I wrote a few Hindley-Milner type inference implementations, but I haven't yet come across a good exposition of how to write a Datalog interpreter.</p>

<p> By ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù I mean about constant retraining and optimisation our brains go through.</p>
<p>Our ‚Äúinternal optimization agent‚Äù sees we have a  graph G(n) of n nodes and a graph G(m) of m nodes. They get combined into a graph of  k=(&lt;m*n) nodes, while maybe not retaining the absolute combined precision, but probably having a modulator which is extracted as a separate graph.</p>
<p>For example, Gn is trained for a fluid (oil)  and Gm is trained for oil. Then, they are merged/splitted into a model that recognizes ‚Äúfluid‚Äù pattern and a ‚Äúviscosity‚Äù pattern (our brains are constantly looking for patterns. constantly. they are our primary source of optimization, i believe that this skill is critical to our brains evolution and that that is why geometry is important in our brains arrangements).  Let‚Äôs say you input lava, it would be recognized by both models, one recognizing it‚Äôs a fluid and the behaviors of fluid and one that can tell you the viscosity of it. Hope I explained it OK, will try to find papers, they do it better probs (i mean, this is my conclusion from reading multiple of papers, so its dot connecting conclusion from multiple sources).</p>

It's stayed with me for the last couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>@Ian Rumac</strong> A few years ago I may have felt the same way, that it was just empty words and not very actionable. But I have a little more of a sense lately of how progress happens in the softer aspects of human endeavor, where the problems are harder and incremental progress is harder to measure. And yet, progress can happen if a new way of adding one more level of structure (such as decomposing "long-term thinking" into 6 pieces) can help people talk about things in just a little bit more detail, and influence how we make decisions. I think this dynamic may be a big part of why people tend to over-estimate what they can do in a month but under-estimate what they can do in a decade. Imperfections are easy to see, and it's easy to forget that progress can compound.</p>
<p>Even for past me, though, there's one part that's unambiguously great: the way it lays out possible teleological goals of human existence:</p>
<ul><li><p>God, the pearly gates and heaven.</p>
</li><li><p>Material goods.</p>
</li><li><p>Colonizing space. (see <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-09-05/the-next-ten-billion-years"></a><a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-09-05/the-next-ten-billion-years">https://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-09-05/the-next-ten-billion-years</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>But the illumination does not come easily. Understanding the
relations of orality and literacy and the implications of the
relations is not a matter of instant psychohistory or instant
phenomenology. It calls for wide, even vast, learning, painstaking
thought and careful statement. Not only are the issues deep and
complex, but they also engage our own biases. &gt; We‚Äîreaders of
books such as this‚Äîare so literate that it is very difficult for us to
conceive of an oral universe of communication or thought except
as a variant of a literate universe.&gt; </p>

<p>I think people have talked before about how this must apply to us, as programmers. This is why I am sure a key tool in FoC will be studying the experience of highly intelligent, computer illiterate people. How easily can, for example, Ruth Bader Ginsburg learn Python? What are her fail modes? I would be fascinated to find out. (Apologies to RBG if she's actually a computer wiz!).</p>

&amp;gt; In both blocks and nodes editors, the interaction loop boils down to summoning a node and then connecting, or placing, it into context. This ends up being a very verb-centric model where you get the <code>+</code> node/block and then wire it up. This is like painting off to the side, moving it to the correct location, and then blending it into the rest of the painting. While there are times where that flow is useful, it‚Äôs much less direct than just painting in place and requires tedious actions inserted in the middle. Going from two steps to three for every action in a system adds up quickly and makes even the most basic operations feel heavy in these editors. Rather than operating in context, you‚Äôre always working off to the side and then rewiring things to make them work.</p>

<p>Visual density aside, I believe the difference in interaction style is a big part of what holds these other types of editors back. In most situations, locate + act is a much more contextual and expressive way to work. It‚Äôd require significant advantages to offset all the awkwardness and busy work that comes with painting off to the side.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by your comment from a while back: ‚Äúthe language I designed based on everything we‚Äôd learned through Eve was dataflow with state machines embedded in it, but it turns out if you flip that the other way around you get something pretty neat.‚Äù Curious if that had legs, or if the stake landed somewhere else?

In my thinking right now it‚Äôs something like control flow vs. data flow.

<p>Many visual programming tools will assign a type to their ports, and whenever a wire is connected to one such port, it can only be connected to other ports with a compatible type.</p>
<p>In my project Hest, wires are used both to convey data (and there may be different kinds of wire, with different appearance and properties and modes of interaction based on the type of data being conveyed), and to exist as "edges" in the sense of 2d vector / 3d graphics, so in that way they're both an aspect of the code and data literal.</p>

<p>Especially interesting for me is the fact that it acknowledges the benefits of linear encoding of information in tools like Roam Research, yet rejects it as insufficient as it excludes "other mentalities."</p>
<p>Another highlight is that it asks browsers to work within the information blocks, rather than in parallel to them. A nice example of composable tools over integrated apps.</p>

But despite the incredible value of this publicity - and the allure of glamorous prizes- virtually none of the entrants get compensated.</p>
<p>In fact, it is an equation sorely in the corporations favor: the more entrants, the more hype, but since the prize pool is fixed, the cost never goes up.</p>
<p>I would recommend anyone considering joining any hackathon to think hard about the power dynamics at play, and the material value of your time spent participating, especially when a hackathon requires you to use the corporation's products(consider particularly that for a public publishing platform, the more usage a product gets the larger its user conversion pipeline becomes). This isn't a novel observation - much has been written about concerning the exploitative nature of hackathons.</p>
<p>And if as a potential participant you want the good-natured competition and dedicated time for hacking on a cool idea that a hackathon affords, it's always possible to organize your own jam, centered around and for the community, without any ulterior motives at play(EDIT: look at game jams like <a href="https://ldjam.com/"></a><a href="https://ldjam.com/">https://ldjam.com/</a> for a very successful model of how this can be done).</p>
<p>(And also, I think the word "grant" should be reserved for actual grants- not marketing contests. I like the idea of grants, and if a company wants to give grants, it should do so in a way that requires minimal effort by the participants, and focus on underrepresented people that badly need them)</p>

For folks in this community, we might stand to gain more from being a judge than being an entrant ‚Äî&nbsp;maybe. And yeah, totally agree, some details of how Replit are structuring and promoting this contest are gross. But I think that's just capitalism ‚Äî we here have the option to not participate in it, and I don't think that they do (what with investors to satisfy, etc.)</p>
<p>Love that you shared these thoughts, Yoshiki. Even though Replit are a benefactor of this community, their support should not shield them from criticism, especially criticism that we could all learn from that will help us do better if/when some of our projects are turned into businesses and we're faced with marketing challenges and the pressures of capitalism ourselves.</p>
<p>(And if Replit decide that they don't want to fund a community that reflects honestly and critically on what they do ‚Äî&nbsp;though I expect Amjad et al would be fine with it ‚Äî then there will be other ways to pay for the podcast, fear not)</p>

<p>That said I don't personally get the idea of jams/hackathons that take place online. I can make something on my own at home. Saying "this weekend is abc jam! just upload your submission online!" doesn't motivate me all. All I want out of a jam is to spend time with actual people, make some new friends, see a new venue, that kind thing.</p>

<p>My intuition is that the computing community in general would be healthier tho if there was a bigger focus on community-driven jams than corporate hackathons, but I need to do more research and thinking to substantiate this.</p>

<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn‚Äôt we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?It is true that few people try to create language. And I guess it would be good it was different. As an example, I thought about trying to actually do it myself after years of programming. I guess I felt unlegitimate to do so before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, of course now I see it can be fun (and that you can even learn thing from it). In fact during workshops with kids sometime we start approaching programming by asking them to create programming languages: one kid plays the role of a robot that has to move on a landscape and an other kid writes down some "formal instructions" of her invention on a paper, and the robot-kid follows the instructions to reach a particular place of the landscape.</p>
<p>So I agree with Replit that it would be nice if creating languages was easier and more widespread.</p>

<p>The authors of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-017-9579-0.pdf"></a><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-017-9579-0.pdf">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-017-9579-0.pdf</a> (linked above) made the following claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings indicate that current IDEs possibly waste a feedback channel to the developer with an ineffective code highlighting scheme. This feedback channel could convey more meaningful information, for example the font colour could encode the type of function in terms of its namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, "semantic highlighting" could be more beneficial for programmer productivity, a paradigm that "attempts to reveal the meaning of the code" instead of just "identifying syntactic elements" [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2846680.2846685"></a><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2846680.2846685">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2846680.2846685</a>]. This can mean something simple like giving each variable its own colour, but I think it can also incorporate more creative ideas.</p>
<p>I found two IDE packages for semantic highlighting: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndreasReischuck.SemanticColorizer"></a><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndreasReischuck.SemanticColorizer">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndreasReischuck.SemanticColorizer</a> for Visual Studio and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/semanticolor"></a><a href="https://atom.io/packages/semanticolor">https://atom.io/packages/semanticolor</a> for Atom. Has anyone here has used those packages (or something similar) and found them useful? I'm also interested what opinions you have about syntax highlighting in general (I've already read <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/hJHCAaiL0so/kG3BHV6QFfIJ"></a><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/hJHCAaiL0so/kG3BHV6QFfIJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/hJHCAaiL0so/kG3BHV6QFfIJ</a>). üôÇ</p>

<p>I had a DM conversation with the creator of this demo and got some backstory you might be interested in. (Paraphrasing, so apologies to the creator if I get this wrong. Also, I believe they wish to remain slightly anonymous.) They originally built this demo in C++, inspired by Bret Victor. They made a video of it, posted it online. (That's why you couldn't find this via search ‚Äî their "website" was only ever just a demo video on an otherwise empty, and now offline, landing page). As they continued to work on it, they realized that they didn't have a good way to scale up their approach to handle more complex cases, not without a tremendous amount of work they weren't prepared to do. Also, they saw what the folks at Luna (now <a href="https://twitter.com/enso_org"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/enso_org">https://twitter.com/enso_org</a>) were doing, and felt that that was a much better approach ‚Äî and that they actually had the funding necessary to make a go of building a novel visual programming environment.</p>

I think the DeepUI prototype was taking a far more interesting and potentially fruitful approach than Luna. To me, Luna is (was) a way of making an ML family language much nicer to work with, but it is not truly visual programming (and neither is Max/MSP, etc). Whereas, DeepUI actually is visual programming in the truest sense, and that, for my money, is a very exciting space just waiting to be explored. There absolutely are ways to scale this sort of a model up handle arbitrary complexity ‚Äî but, I agree, it will take a tremendous amount of work.

<p>Marketplace ‚Äî this is my "if I can't think of anything better, copy Unity" idea for monetizing Hest. I hope I think of something better, because this feels like the sort of thing you should do after your tool becomes wildly popular.

<ol start="3"><li>Seems interesting, but there's nothing here about what this looks like. Do nodes with an error as part of the type signature turn red? Can you do any debugging on the visual side?</li></ol><blockquote><p>Moreover, the language was designed such that, even if you create syntax errors, all expressions not affected by the error will still work. That is that, if one of the nodes in your graph has a syntax error, the other nodes still function correctly. This sounds like an obvious requirement for a visual language, but is currently not implemented in any textual language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's cool, but that's how JavaScript works. You can have a function that throws an error or fails to parse, and code that's outside the stack of the thrown error or the scope of the syntax error (but in the same JS context) will continue to run unaffected. They probably meant to say "not implemented in any textual language ill with the type disease" :P</p>

It echoes a lot of things we've arrived at over the years. We're big on the idea of "design the gameplay first, then figure out what you can use that gameplay to teach" as opposed to the reverse. We also have a huge focus on systems-thinking, since we specialize in teaching troubleshooting skills. We also also strive to impart the "spirit of engineering", in addition to familiarity with particular technical matter.</p>
<p>One problem that we continually run into is that our biggest clients expect their educational software to fit a very specific, very familiar format. They buy educational software primarily for compliance reasons, not with an interest in helping people learn and do better at their jobs. (Worth noting: these clients are multinational companies, mostly focussed on resources, manufacturing, or transportation ‚Äî business not known for being progressive.) They want multiple choice quizzes. They want slideshows. When we build things that learners genuinely enjoy using, we often have trouble getting higher-ups to deploy them across their org.</p>
<p>So I bristle at Blow's contention that there aren't people out there trying to make these sorts of games. There are! It's just not a guarantee that if we build it, they (customers) will come.</p>

<p>In Blow's defense, he doesn't blame it all on the creators. He explicitly states how this kind of paradigm will never be bought by the current education establishment. It's the section where he compares the current education system to Cable packages from the 80's.</p>
<p>His suggestion is to ignore that market and go to Steam or the more general game markets instead. It's not a great solution honestly... You have to pay the bills, and Steam just can't compare to these big corporate contracts. The incentive structure is working against you hard here! It's a hard problem for sure.</p>

The <a href="https://www.lunchboxsessions.com"></a><a href="https://www.lunchboxsessions.com">https://www.lunchboxsessions.com</a> I linked is something we built to run around the establishment and break down the back door.</p>
<p>(You probably know this, but I'll say it for the benefit of anyone reading who doesn't know...) Most companies have a Learning Management System (LMS) and expect to be able to buy modular slideshow+quiz content to plug into it, and then they assign that content to their employees whenever the mandated compliance schedule or some special circumstances (eg: a lawsuit) requires them to do so. To play in this market, you need to be B2B and by the book.</p>
<p>Our strategy for LunchBox Sessions is to force companies out of that mold. It's an iPhone-esq walled garden, that is meant to be discovered first by the employees who will be taking the training, who then tell their managers "This is really good, please buy this for us". Those managers then say to us, "Put your stuff in our corporate LMS", and we say "We can't". Occasionally, the company will relent and buy our material on our terms. The employees using the software love it, and we've won a customer for life. Often though, the company says "too bad" to their employees, and so we just have to wait for them to come around.</p>
<p>This "grassroots" / word-of-mouth approach to sales led to a lot of really interesting design choices at pretty much every level, all the way down to how we plan gameplay and educational objectives and such. Too much to go into here, but (tying back to the original post) there are definitely ways to improve the educational software market ‚Äî they just, as Blow advocates, have to come mostly from outside the current practice.</p>

<p>I'm the only formal programmer at our company, and I don't do any of the work on our content ‚Äî I just build tools (and... all our web services, from visual design to database optimization, /curtsy/). When we hire a content creator, we hire only for art skills, and then train them how to program well enough to add logic and interactivity to their artwork ‚Äî&nbsp;basic procedural code: variables, conditionals, calling functions, but not necessarily even arrays or maps. That training process takes about six months (most of it focused on domain-specific stuff), but they're usually able to build simple simulations pretty much immediately. We typically have 3-6 artists on the team. We'd happily train them much further in programming, but none of them have wanted to learn that yet (can't blame them.. which is why we're all here, right?)</p>
<p>Our current pipeline is:</p>
<ul><li>Draw in Adobe Animate (nee Flash) or Illustrator, with names given to various objects in the drawing.</li><li>Export to SVG (which forces us to only use a safe subset of drawing features, sadly)</li><li>Run a simple CLI tool to scaffold an interactive simulation atop our in-house <a href="https://github.com/cdig/svga/wiki"></a><a href="https://github.com/cdig/svga/wiki">https://github.com/cdig/svga/wiki</a> (titled SVGA)</li><li>Write some high-level CoffeeScript code to express the simulation logic, add controls, etc.</li><li>Run a CLI command to deploy to our site. The final result is a single HTML file that works in any modern browser. Typical build size is about 200 KB, including the framework.</li></ul><p>It takes one of our artists about a week to build <a href="https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/deere-hitachi-excavators-shovels/hitachi-arm-regenerative-circuit-simulation"></a><a href="https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/deere-hitachi-excavators-shovels/hitachi-arm-regenerative-circuit-simulation">https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/deere-hitachi-excavators-shovels/hitachi-arm-regenerative-circuit-simulation</a> from scratch, with a fairly even split of time between planning, research, design, art, and coding. According to <code>cloc</code>, that linked simulation is about 1700 lines of SVG art (after automatic optimizations), and 600 LOC of CoffeeScript simulation logic (where the amount framework boilerplate in that is probably less than 5%)</p>
<p>(If you're not familiar with it, the graphical symbols we use are fairly standard in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iso+hydraulic+schematic"></a><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iso+hydraulic+schematic">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iso+hydraulic+schematic</a>, with a bit of our own spin to make them more amenable to animation).</p>
<p>That framework I keep referencing is about 4k LOC, and took probably 6 months to develop, spread out a fair bit.</p>
<p>Finally ‚Äî the FoC project I'm building, <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1586795860004500"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1586795860004500">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1586795860004500</a>, is intended to take us away from writing text-based code at all, to let us build these simulations inside an Adobe/Autodesk-esq graphical environment. I've been working on Hest off-and-on for about 5 years now, and plan for it to be the main thing I work on for the next decade (aside from keeping our web services alive, of course)</p>

<blockquote><p>‚ÄúBeing a creator of and steward for Flash as a platform was a privilege. I felt that we were building a pencil and it was the community of creators that was responsible for the creation of Flash as a creative form. Our job as stewards was to anticipate needs, listen and make sure it worked. The core idea of having an accessible system for creating interactive media content that works across a range of devices is still a powerful one. Just like pencil and paper is a powerful tool. I hope it will happen again. Many years ago, I had the idea of Flash Forever. How can we treat what is created in Flash as valuable information like a book? Sadly, the need to drive business growth by adding features and capabilities, trumped the need for permanence. It‚Äôs great that Flash still lives in the skills and experiences of the community of people who learned and grew with it.‚Äù -- Jonathan Gay,  Creator of Flash</p>

<p>Two things come to mind. </p>
<p>1) there is no way to distribute the creations as a single file like you could with flash and a swf file. It would be a minimum of 3 files, one HTML, one player file (probably too big), one data files. Where as with flash you generally had the player installed.</p>
<p>Unity has this issue. the smallest web app is 5-6meg just for the base engine.</p>
<p>2)  pre smartphones there was effective only one platform.  a desktop PC with a keyboard + mouse + landscape orientation screen.  Now the major market is smartphones and in particular Apple has argrubly actively discouraged browser based games by not supporting the html standards that could make them a good experience.</p>
<p>Of course a flash like editor could export to a native app though maybe at that level it can't compete with unity.</p>

<p>This problem is what I've spent much of the last decade working on at my job, but at a small scale, focused just on making an alternative to Flash for our unique needs. We used to be a 100% Flash media shop, and now we still use Flash Animate to draw our artwork, but export to SVG and use CoffeeScript as a successor to ActionScript. The final animation is a self-contained HTML file, with about 50kb of framework code (that can be inlined or served by a CDN). I just posted a big comment about our production process, if you're <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595443888155200?thread_ts=1595438091.136800&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595443888155200?thread_ts=1595438091.136800&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1595443888155200?thread_ts=1595438091.136800&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL</a>.</p>
<p>My FoC project is meant to be a successor to our current framework, so in that way it's meant to be a spiritual descendent of Flash. We're interested in making some money from it, too, so we're staring down that "why is there no market" question. Like our current framework, the plan is for there to be no player ‚Äî just small, self-contained HTML files.</p>
<p>The plan is to compete with non-consumption, or perhaps to compete with "hire a multimedia team". Definitely looking at Unity as an example, but not going to swim in that part of the pool.</p>

<p>I mean, they're conflated together by history ‚Äî Flash was both of those things. A modern successor to Flash might also conflate those things. It's not necessary, but it might be beneficial. Look at Unreal ‚Äî the engine and distribution platform (Epic Games Store) are technically separate, but they're designed to be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>It's also sort of unavoidable to consider the output format when creating an authoring tool. And if your authoring tool is creating content for the web, you want the output format to be optimized for portability ‚Äî a single file, or at least something that's easy to link to or easy to embed in a blog post. And something that anyone can view without a plugin. If you aren't thinking about that when designing an authoring tool, you're going to end up in a sad place.</p>

<p>It's not necessary, but it might be beneficial.I think this is the more important point... Was Flash successful because these things were tied together, or is that just historical accident?</p>
<p>It's hard to compare with the Epic Games Store imo. It's too new.</p>
<p>If you look at Steam as a counter point, it's very successful as a distribution platform, and is very isolated from the content creation itself.</p>

Flash had to create its own file format and player because there was no built-in functionality for multimedia on the web. There wasn't even audio ‚Äî remember RealPlayer? There were other plugins they could have hooked into (Java Applets, say) but those sucked.</p>
<p>What we can have now (though nobody has done a good job of it) is an authoring tool that can spit out self-contained files that work anywhere (on the web), thanks to HTML and the web platform. So as long as your authoring tool produces nicely self-contained single HTML files, you're a lot closer to having that particular question answered, without needing a boil the ocean "our plugin is on 97% of PCs" solution.</p>
<p>So the distribution is "tied" to the editor only insofar as the editor needs to do just that ‚Äî spit out files that people can actually use.</p>

<p>I think my problem with <a href="https://gregggman.com">Gregg Tavares</a>'s original argument was that he was looking at it backwards from my view point.</p>
<p>The problem has nothing to do with the distribution format as a technology... It's not a technology problem, it's a social / market problem.</p>
<p>It's not that there is no market, it's like you said, there is a market on the consumer side. The problem is that there is no incentive on the business side to build it.</p>
<p>In that way, Flash was a product of it's time. Unfortunately the world is a different place now.</p>

You can't currently make a small single file embeddable multi-media experience with a single HTML file. You could encode your video/audio as dataURLs but the file will be HUGE. You could maybe generate some vector graphics animations in a single HTML file but not your average flash game. Further, flash's format was compat, arguably more than you'll get from HTML without some kind of player (so bloating your page). Other functionally you can't get from HTML in a single file is streaming. Flash could have a 2meg file but after download 50k it was running and downloading the rest in the background. Again to that in HTML requires a player and at least 2-3 files. The HTML itself, the player, either embedded or referenced, and then the data and the data has to be separate else you can't stream</p>
<p>Whether a single file format is important or not is debatable but it's certainly helps things go viral if they can easily be put anywhere by anyone? I suppose hosting your multi-file creation somewhere and letting people embed it would work that costs $$$. Maybe something like <a href="http://youflashtube.com"></a><a href="http://youflashtube.com">http://youflashtube.com</a> and have the editor either online or export directly. I can imagine in some alternate reality that might be successful but it wouldn't be remotely the same as flash was if only because a hosted experience will be censored in various ways</p>
<p>As for unity, unity's web player has been long dead. Unity exports to HTML5/WASM for years now but the minimum size for hello world is 4meg which is basically Unity's engine so effectively it's as if every app is downloading the flash player. I know they are working on shrinking that significantly but I don't know how far along they are.</p>
<p>It's also not mobile friendly which which may or may not matter. If you're trying to make a profit by selling an app/game then you're happy with exporting a native app. If you're trying to make some viral experience that people share with just a link like they did with flash then not being mobile browser friendly is a non-starter</p>
<p>As for three.js, once you gzip it it's only 150k at the moment so barely a single image worth of data on most pages. It doesn't "tree shake" at all at the moment because if legacy code design but they are working on it. But three.js is not even a small amount of flash's functionality. It's just a 3d engine not an app/game engine.</p>

<p>You are giving more examples of finished products that are not all there.</p>
<p>These are good examples of what is not working right now, but none of these examples show any fundamental missing pieces for why a new flash like platform can't work.</p>
<p>From a distribution perspective, I think all the technological pieces are there. Even before web assembly, I think the parts where there.</p>
<p>The death of flash is one of the big reasons web browsers started to grow the necessary features to replace flash(for better or worse). Web assembly might be the final piece, because it allows a single binary blob to be easily embedded and run. We just need to get better at compression (which is actively being worked on.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gregggman.com">Gregg Tavares</a> My question for you is, if you think all the pieces are not there. What pieces do you think are missing? Not which product is missing, we wouldn't be having this discussion if a finished product already existed, but which technological or social pieces are missing?</p>

<p>Now about your 4 things. I'm going to disagree with you on a few points:</p>
<blockquote><ol start="1"><li>being able to distribute as a single file. not entirely sure this is important but feel it's possible it is importantI would like to point out that Flash was not that different.</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>In theory you could just "play a swf" file directly, but nobody did that. You still had to host a website with an HTML file (and probably a CSS file), and embed the swf file. And the user had to download or update their flash player on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In fact, nobody did that either! They uploaded their swf to Newgrounds, who did all the hosting work for them. The key here is the marketplace (Newgrounds).</p>
<p>That's not much different than the JS/WASM, HTML, CSS combo we have today. It's not really just "one file"...</p>
<p>An important part of the equation was that Newgrounds did a lot of that hosting work for you as a content creator.</p>
<p>There is no reason the same kind of thing couldn't be done for WASM or modern JS. In fact, that's what <a href="http://itch.io"></a><a href="http://itch.io">http://itch.io</a> and Pico-8 are doing!</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that you can embedd assets in the WASM binary!</p>
<p>Modern assets like 3D models and bitmap textures are also very different from Vector based assets (I will talk more about this below).</p>
<p>The key is that there was a convenient way to get from the content creation tool to the hosting site easily. That's a really good point!</p>
<p>I just want to point out that there is nothing technologically preventing us from building something just as convenient today, it just hasn't been built yet...</p>
<blockquote><p>being able to stream the assets from that single file vs having to wait for the entire file to download. If 1 is important than so is this.I am actually not sure what you mean by stream assets. It's been a long time since I programmed with flash (I did back in the day, but it was a looong time ago), but I'm pretty sure it didn't "stream" anything, at least not in the modern sense of sending bytes over a network a little bit at a time. Youtube didn't even exist until 2005, and when Youtube started, streaming technology was still pretty bad... If I'm wrong, please give me a source and correct me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what you mean is compression. Flash was good at compression. It also had good "time to first interaction" latency. I totally agree that "time to first interaction" is super important and extremely under appreciated with modern computers. It's a big pet peeve of mine (and anyone who follows Jon Blow, Casey Muratori, and the handmade philosophy).,</p>
<p>I would like to point out the Flash assets were almost entirely vector based. Vectors compress extremely well! They are just control points for a Bezier curve equation.</p>
<p>The internet also had much less bandwidth during the height of Flash, so in general the assets were smaller.</p>
<p>I remember Flash animations that had a lot of bitmap assets instead of vectors. You got loading screens just as bad as today (worse in some cases).</p>
<p>The situation is actually better today for the end user from the tech standpoint. The internet has orders of magnitude more bandwidth, and the browser apis let us do actual proper streaming of data (through js download requests or websockets).</p>
<blockquote><p>working well on mobile in the browser (this is only semi-possible because Apple has so far refused to implement the needed APIs.

<p>It wasn't just that the tech existed. It's that there was an app that let people easily use tech to make stuff.I think you make a really good point here.

By this I mean an abstract model (not a DRAM/disk representation) with a vocabulary that allows a human to read, specify, and understand information with ease. We have existing models like RDF ("Semantic web") and property graphs (e.g. Neo4j), and in programming languages we have object graphs (OO languages), trees (functional languages), and tables (relational DBs). None of these models seem to have arisen as "the one true answer", partially because they are all difficult to reason about when operated on programmatically (or so I claim). I want a model for information that allows us to easily understand both static information structures (snapshots) and programmatically-maintained information structures (an evolving, stateful system).</p>
<p>The ideal model for information might define concepts like "pointing" (edges) or "nesting" (groups), and each concept will have a clear meaning. The ideal model will also have a semantics for mutation, e.g. you will know when you define a relationship like <code>A points to B</code> whether <code>B</code> can be deleted or modified in some way, and how this affects the <code>points to</code> connection. The model will also have a notion of stewardship of information, i.e. it should be easy to observe the source of a piece of information, and to know whether it is mutable or just a snapshot. (Yes, I believe the ideal model for information should have a vocabulary to describe distribution and trust).</p>
<p>Has anyone here thought hard about this? I've been churning on it for a month or two recently, and for many months over the last few years; I can't proceed with my own PL project until I get fundamentals like this right, since the model that I develop will fundamentally determine what a "program" even is. I think a key reason why discovering "the future of programming" is so hard is that we think too much about code and not enough about information. Code exists purely to transform information, and if you don't make strides on models for information then I don't think you can make strides on programming languages.</p>
<p>I have some ideas about a model, but I have no insights from others to validate it against. My conception is a very specific hybrid of mutable graphs and immutable trees nested sets that distinguishes between descriptions and references, and it seems very amenable to compact 2D representations, unlike most graphs. I won't describe it further just yet, since I don't want to skew anyone's responses.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd love to hear from other people who have been thinking about this kind of stuff.</p>

A few fingers pointing toward the moon:</p>
<ul><li>It would be best for such a system to store the data in a structure that "changes" through accretion rather than mutation (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.8253&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"></a><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.8253&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.8253&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>, much emulated since). If every modification point is essentially a snapshot, you get time travel and other useful semantics for free (Datomic is a recent database that uses this approach).</li><li>Up-front schemas are brittle over time. The less you can get away with saying about structure, the better off you will be. (A special case of the more general advice to "design for change").</li><li>The approach whereby everything is a logical assertion (i.e. triples, sometimes called "Subject/Predicate/Object", sometimes "Entity/Attribute/Value", depending on the culture of the speaker) is the most flexible I've been able to come up with yet. This underlies RDF (and TripleStores generally), and is currently in vogue among those who have encountered datalog, mostly via Datomic.</li><li>It's very useful to be able to specify additional automatic behavior over triples via some kind of metadata, in the best case also specified in triples. (RDF via OWL, not Datamic.)</li></ul><p>I have many differences of taste with the place where RDF ultimately went, but there's loads of good stuff in there too. You can find out more about the history of the "data as assertions" approach by reading up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning</a> (as distinct from data representation), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)#Frame_language"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)#Frame_language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)#Frame_language</a>, and so on. This stuff is one of the threads that leads to object orientation, though much less emphasized in a modern context than the strand motivated by simulation.</p>
<p>The "immutable tree on disk" stuff comes from generalizing database journals, which for me starts in the 80s with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system</a>.

<p>So for me it is important to step back and look at common patterns of cognition - how we organise our perception of reality. One approach is to read Roget's Thesaurus!

<p>Sometimes there's a tendency to seek "elegant" solutions which use the minimum possible number of concepts, whereas I think it's often more natural to expand the number of concepts, even if introduces "redundancy".</p>
<p>For example, you can describe a bijection between XML and JSON, that would involve translating JSON lists into a something you can describe in XML such as ["one", "two", "three"] becomes &lt;list-item index="0"&gt;one&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item index="1"&gt;two&lt;/list-item&gt;... or something.</p>
<p>You could say that XML is a more elegant way to represent information, because it is based basically only on the concepts of Containment, Naming and Properties.

I refrained from using the word "data" because it's a machine-oriented word and I don't want people to start talking about conventional data structures and pointers. I want to focus on the human interface, not the machine representation.</p>
<p>I'm not too concerned with standardizing ontologies or AI right now. I'm more concerned with allowing humans to group a bunch of symbols together by hand or programmatically in a way that makes sense for their own understanding. I'm designing a programming language, but unlike almost everyone in the last few decades, I'm not taking "arrays" or "objects" or "algebraic data types" or "databases" or "relations" for granted: I'm trying to figure out, from complete scratch, what information structures are easiest for people to think with when they are integrated into a complex system (e.g. a distributed app). I'm trying to be as general as I can, but my domain is "programming", taken broadly.</p>
<p>I want a model for information that allows users to encode information like "Bob has a car with 4 wheels" in the form that is most useful to their specific application. In a company database the car might be an immutable fact with an associated date and source. You might then tell me that the right model for encoding information about cars is the relational model. However, in a video game the car might be an entity with a position that changes over time, and so we need to be able to talk about the idea of change and the distinction between descriptions (where the description itself doesn't "change" as time passes) and references (where the entities referred to can change).</p>
<p>The question of "how do I model information" may seem trivial (or "solved") at first glance, but the moment I ask that you don't treat conventional data structures as axioms ("we already figured it out, just mix these existing things together and follow best practices"), it becomes incredibly deep.</p>

<p>I agree that it's wise to limit unnecessary structure: scenarios where a relationship is specified with some kind of directionality/asymmetry that isn't inherent.

<blockquote><p>where I am right now in my journey, that is basically: identity of things, properties of things, relations between things.How do you distinguish between properties and relations? Is the fact that I'm "holding my tea cup" a property of myself, or am I just in a relationship with my tea cup?</p>
<p>At a more abstract level, you have symbols of value, order of those symbols and their aggregations, bags/sets of symbols.What is a "symbol of value"? I don't quite understand that term. And you seem to recognise both sets and bags? I've always found those to be in contention with one another, and so I've (for the meantime) concluded that if a user is in a scenario where they want a bag (which should be rare), they can simulate it with a set quite easily. The converse is not possible, though.</p>
<p>So, as you can probably deduce, I've settled on something that looks like objects that have unique identity, which are bags of propertiesI've currently settled on two notions that together can act like a conventional object. The first is something I'm tentatively calling a picture, which is a set with an exterior label (I call it the topic) that contains symbols and/or further pictures (these are called subtopics). These can be used to form the "descriptions" I was hinting at earlier; they are immutable value types. If you want a picture to be mutable (and thus behave like an object), you can stick it in a workspace, which is the unit of mutability. Workspaces are identified (and thus referenced, and queried) by the aforementioned symbols. A workspace's state evolves by a rulebook (a set of rules), which updates a workspace's picture in response to events. I plan to base the semantics of rules on logic programming. The end result will be something like "nested Datalog", though there is no literature that matches the model I described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Picture topics replace the need to have a special notion of a statically-specified "attribute", because the topic can itself be any value. This should hopefully make meta-programming possible, but at the very least, I hope it leads to a very minimalist (and intuitive) semantics.</p>
<p>All of the above is subject to change, of course! Given my current track record, I wouldn't be surprised if I find some major flaw in this kind of architecture.</p>

<blockquote><p>One issue that really bugs me is that I can't extract a single representation of order!If you make any breakthroughs on this, let me know. I'm still trying to figure out how to represent sequences (lists, priority queues) and trees (e.g. family trees, or any other domain-relevant tree structure) in a non-hierarchical manner, such that users can perform arbitrary traversals (in any direction) and queries. My big constraint here is that I want to ensure traversals will always terminate, so I need there to be some measure of progress associated with the traversal rules. Another challenge is multi-dimensional ordered structures, for example, a spreadsheet! How can one describe a traversal across a spreadsheet? Every cell in a spreadsheet is ordered in two dimensions! My current line of investigation is to determine whether all kinds of ordering can be exposed as numberings, and sequence manipulation is manipulation of those numberings, i.e. a list might look like <code>{(c,1), (a,2), (t,3)}</code> and a priority queue might look like <code>{(c, -12), (a, 7), (t, 34)}</code>. I'm thinking of going deep and figuring out if lists and trees can be treated as spatial data sets and manipulated geometrically.</p>

<p>set/bag: just recognition that ordered lists sometimes don't need order, but have to be laid out somehow in space, which means the order is incidental. I don't think this is a problem though.</p>

<blockquote><p>I've currently settled on two notions that together can act like a conventional object. The first is something I'm tentatively calling a&nbsp;&gt; picture&gt; , which is a&nbsp;&gt; set&gt; &nbsp;with an exterior label (I call it the&nbsp;&gt; topic&gt; ) that contains&nbsp;&gt; symbols&gt; &nbsp;and/or further pictures (these are called&nbsp;&gt; subtopics&gt; ). These can be used to form the "descriptions" I was hinting at earlier; they are immutable value types. If you want a picture to be mutable (and thus behave like an object), you can stick it in a&nbsp;&gt; workspace&gt; , which is the unit of mutability. Workspaces are identified (and thus referenced, and queried) by the aforementioned symbols. A workspace's state evolves by a&nbsp;&gt; rulebook&gt; &nbsp;(a set of&nbsp;&gt; rules&gt; ), which updates a workspace's picture in response to&nbsp;&gt; events&gt; . I plan to base the semantics of rules on logic programming. The end result will be something like "nested Datalog", though there is no literature that matches the model I described above.</p>

<p>Picture topics replace the need to have a special notion of a statically-specified "attribute", because the topic can itself be any value. This should hopefully make meta-programming possible, but at the very least, I hope it leads to a very minimalist (and intuitive) semantics.</p>

<p>What I see now is (obviously?) graphs are the only, truly extendable &amp; fractal like structures.</p>
<p>Fractal like: which also means the minimum we can do with the ‚ÄúGraph Information‚Äù on a the ‚Äúsimplest level‚Äù is also the maximum we can do with it on ‚Äúhigher levels‚Äù. With that in mind I feel like the direction to is to build ‚ÄúViews‚Äù on the top of the ‚ÄúGraph Information‚Äù - which Views themselves are going to be Graph based entities. Also, we can say these Views would act like filters to reduce the noise of ‚Äúall information‚Äù and deliver the proper context.</p>
<p>So after that, my answer is: just simple, pure Graphs, but a new question arises: how to build Views on them - even on multiple levels‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I just don‚Äôt see ANY other idea which can‚Äôt be translated to that approach. It seems to me it‚Äôs the alpha and omega.</p>

The difference is largely in how people approach the two mechanisms. One is just a more specific name, the other is an actual place.

Part of the difference is also how you selected a database in Eve (declaring it at the search/bind level) which made unions pretty awkward. That one's not at all fundamental and you could've chosen something else, but I suspect it would look a lot like namespaced tags if you did.</p>

I think we should talk about "entities" and "pointers" between them as a potential use case for graphs rather than talking about graphs first and figuring out their applicability thereafter.

<p>I‚Äôd add that, which is remained unsolved to me in the past years, and maybe this is the main driver behind all of my research:</p>
<p>Be ready to change/delete any part of the code any time!</p>
<p>Mixing it with your 2nd (controlling evo) and 4th (controlling deps) point:</p>
<p>avoid broken abstractions</p>
<ul><li>AKA -</li></ul><p>don‚Äôt write (or evolve to!) code which forces you to delete more (prod+test) code than neccesary (in case of new requirements) </p>
<ul><li>AKA -</li></ul><p>eliminate God Objects (don‚Äôt even let them birth!)</p>
<p>-AKA - </p>
<p>Minimal surface: don‚Äôt make available any data in any given scope you don‚Äôt use =&gt; if you do, you are creating a God object and you have to REIMPLEMENT the stuff after deleting the nighmare and all of its connections.</p>
<p>Sure it is an obvious idea to do that, but hard/impossible(!!!) to do without the correct level of abstractions (I think anything ‚Äúbelow eventStreams‚Äù).</p>
<p>To me it seems like we might need some level of redundancy to get there, but I‚Äôd pay that price if I can make sure the freaking God object and spaghetti bs goes away‚Ä¶</p>
<p>This is just a deep intuition at this time, but I‚Äôll update on that later.</p>

<p>Sometimes there's the illusion of modularity in software, where a larger behavior is handed off from one thing to the next; but that's not modularity, because you pull one thing out of the pipeline, and you've broken that overall behavior. Generally speaking, you want "vertical" slicing, not horizontal. So instead of A hands off to B hands off to C (which slices what should be one while picture into fragments), you instead have the whole flow exist as one whole thing, and it may call down into A, B, and C. But for example, the code that updates your database should not "know" that it's supposed to do that after the user clicks a button.</p>

Those things can have their place, but if it's to split apart a larger whole, rather than to incorporate multiple unrelated whole things that don't need to work together, than that's not modularity: you're going to have to reverse engineer everything and trace the cause and effect all over the place, to really understand what's happening in that code, and you're opening the door for race conditions and unexpected breakages when things change. The whole point of modularity is to make it easy to understand and change things.</p>

<p>On a different note, there's a common idiom of decomposing programs into layers (MVC, app/lib/kernel, etc.) That's arguably a hierarchical organization even though there's no containment. The network is a DAG, and it has a definite 'grain' to it. This feels like an important lens. Arguably here we already have tags, in the form of providers and so on.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some things fit multiple categories, or can play multiple roles, and that does not slice cleanly into exclusive buckets<strong>@Dan Cook</strong> Yes, I agree. There's a need to be able to categorise something without allocating it to an exclusive location (a bucket).</p>
<p>Each module [...] may be an inhabitant of a larger world, or may have inhabitants of its own. But it should have no knowledge of the outside world, or of the inside world of its inhabitants.How do you identity whether a module has inappropriate "knowledge" of something external? You must be talking about Objects specifically, right? Classic information hiding concerns etc. Your answers all seem to be in the context of OOP and method calls.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you want "vertical" slicing, not horizontalI'm not really clear what distinction you're trying to make there. Are you arguing for call stacks (RPC) over message-passing and/or events? Call stacks are definitely banned from my own design. They're irredeemable in a distributed system.</p>
<p>you're going to have to reverse engineer everything and trace the cause and effect all over the place, to really understand what's happening in that code, and you're opening the door for race conditions and unexpected breakages when things changeThese are problems induced by poor language and tool designs; they're not really an immediate consequence of having an event system. I agree that if you have some kind of event system, then it has to be designed to play a carefully thought-out role in a larger architecture and in a way that can't be abused or "used wrong".</p>

Hierarchy will help with the cognitive complexity of the graph, IF the average amount of edges is low or very clustered.

I'd say that any proper module are just x, and only contain functionality (if any) for acting on that x. That x can be simple data, or a whole system -- so long as it's a whole system (which can contain other entities that are also whole in the same way). A module does not act on its neighbor or outside world, only on its contents aka "itself".</p>

<p>What is the difference between an exclusive data bucket and a tag? Is one inferior to the other? How do you tell them apart, behaviourally?</p>
<p>(My definition of "bucket" here means simply an exclusive location that a datum is considered to "live" within, whereas a "tag" is not a residence. Example of buckets: the "folders" of a hierarchical file system. Example of tags: the labels placed upon Github issues or the #hashtags of social media posts.)</p>

The exclusivity of a bucket allows you to leverage your Location powers. As things like the Mind Palace technique, and the trick of returning to the place you lost your train of thought, show, leveraging our sense of physical location is very powerful.</p>
<p>Tags are also brilliant, but they leverage a different thing, which is our natural ability to categorise and stereotype. This is mainly useful for describing queries and commands.</p>
<p>I remember having an argument about 15 years ago with somebody who was saying that filesystems should be rewritten to be based only on tags, as it's more general. They made the (good) point that it's absurd to distinguish between /usr/photos/wedding/ and /usr/wedding/photos/. I still struggle to explain why I hate the idea so gutturally, but I do. I can't relax until I can say "that's there's, that's here" etc. </p>
<p>Basically the ideal system for me is built on a bedrock of buckets, but with the ability to arbitrary query it based on properties, including arbitrary user defined tags. Something's location, i.e. it's filepath can be considered an implicit tag but it should be recognised as fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I am actually making a system like this; basically a Lucene+Tika powered add-on for a filesystem. Impossible to know how universal my preferences are   ü§∑</p>

<p>Mathematically, a set and a tag can both be just a binary relation without any explicit properties assumed. Then they could be the same, behaviorally.</p>
<p>A list implies some sort of order on multiple relations of that kind, which a tag doesn‚Äôt (although you‚Äôd always have to order elements tagged with the same tag in some way to display them).</p>
<p>Tables and databases add more assumptions on the relations they model. Are they reflexive? Transitive (which you need to model hierarchy)? Etc.</p>
<p>Tags probably feel more flexible because they don‚Äôt assume anything about the relation they model other than that there exists one (perhaps if it‚Äôs one- or two-way?), while ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù, especially when seen as containers, do assume that these relations have additional properties which makes them less ‚Äúflexible‚Äù.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of tags is diluted by practical concerns, e.g. how to display all elements tagged with the same tag, and then you‚Äôre forced to ensure the relations have certain properties, and suddenly you‚Äôre back in container-land, just that the same elements can now also be in several containers at once. And then you run into questions of identity: if I change that element in one category, does it change everywhere, or does it just change in the current context (was it just a copy)?</p>
<p>Also, not hard-coding any properties of these relations basically just shifts the burden on the user; they still need to remember what a tag means to them and keeping different kinds of meaning apart. That‚Äôs when they suddenly re-introduce containment with hacks like namespaces or paths.</p>
<p>Technically, modeling fewer assumptions on relations gives you more flexibility in exchange for performance, as the system can‚Äôt make certain assumptions (e.g. order) which could be used for optimizations (e.g. indices).</p>
<p>Thankfully, the way the system seems to work from a user‚Äôs perspective doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the way it‚Äôs implemented. That probably is what good abstractions are about ‚Äî they‚Äôre not just hiding something, they‚Äôre hiding a dramatically different structure that you wouldn‚Äôt expect from how the system behaves ‚Äî and hopefully the way it behaves is easier to understand than how it actually works.</p>

I'm (personally) not interested in talking about specific data structures or data models in this thread. That kind of discussion is best reserved for the thread I initiated yesterday. I listed a couple of examples only to hint at how the abstract notion of a "bucket" can manifest.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äúbuckets‚Äù, especially when seen as containers, do assume that these relations have additional properties which makes them less ‚Äúflexible‚Äù.I think the actual interface that users are presented with is going to be the main driver of assumptions about what a bucket means. My definition of "bucket" here means simply an exclusive location that a datum is considered to "live" within. That's extremely broad, and my hope for this thread is that we can work out the relevance and utility of buckets in comparison to tags.</p>
<p>And then you run into questions of identity: if I change that element in one category, does it change everywhere, or does it just change in the current context (was it just a copy)?I actually believe this to be the only difference between buckets and tags. In the presence of mutation, the two concepts may behave differently, and without mutation, they are equivalent. I've not yet had time to develop detailed reasoning as to why this might be the case. I'll hopefully post something here in the next 24h.</p>

<p>As for List / Table: they have an extra layer of connection via integers (list 1D, table 2D), but you could replace this ‚Äúmesh‚Äù with adding proper next/prev information (tags) everywhere. Integers themselves can be modeled! You should check out Idris!</p>

<p>To me, naturally, if we would like to be really really precise we would only use Sets + adding out extra layers of information to the models by ourselves, but Integers are so useful and make us so capable to hack around with a degree of certaincy without fluff.

<p>On the other hand, building on Integers means you are exposed to ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù, because you don‚Äôt use the ‚Äúreal interfaces‚Äù Integers themselves really do have behind. (eg. successor aka ‚Äúnext‚Äù/ successor^-1 aka ‚Äúprev‚Äù)</p>

This is what maps to our natural understanding of location and identity. An object can only be in one place. If otherwise identical objects are in different locations we perceive them as copies. I think this persists even if mutations on one affect the other. We perceive the "other object" as being magically affected "at a distance", we can't perceive it as one object with two locations. The notion than an object can only be in one location at a time, overpowers the related notion that objects can easily change their location and persist their identity.</p>
<p>This is not quite the same as containment. The features of physical containment are transitivity and anti-reflectivity. If A contains B, then B cannot contain A. If A contains B, and B contains C, then C is also inside A (indirectly).</p>
<p>A filesystem obeys these physical properties, but something like Python's list does not obey either. This is why users get confused by lists that contain each other, and objects being changed when they are in two lists. It is also why symlinks can be so confusing. (You thought you were deleting a copy? Too bad sucker!)</p>

<p>When you say ‚Äúinterface‚Äù I hear ‚Äúhow users understand it‚Äù. Then we can talk about my favorite topic: image schemas. These are cognitive patterns that we all use to structure our understanding.</p>
<p>A ‚Äúbucket‚Äù is an instance of the container schema. Things are either in it or not, and it has a boundary (which we might or might not be able to describe precisely). That means that the container is of a different quality than the elements it contains.</p>
<p>A ‚Äútag‚Äù is an instance of the link schema. It just means there is something that connects the things at the two ends like a rope (imagine the force you feel when two items are tied together with a rope; and it is such physicality that gives meaning to the abstract concept). The two items connected to each other don‚Äôt automatically have different ‚Äústatus‚Äù like in the container version, although they could have through other schemas in effect simultaneously.</p>
<p>We can cope with the same things being in different containers at once, usually through frames, which are larger contexts of experience. E.g. when you say ‚Äúcut the flesh‚Äù and you are in a restaurant, you evoke completely different images than when you‚Äôre a surgeon in a hospital. And it even works out ok on the surgeon‚Äôs night out to the steak house. ;-)</p>
<p>Now if you use a tag to signify membership to a group, e.g. all blog articles tagged with ‚Äútechnology‚Äù, then it‚Äôs used much more like a container and likely understood based on the container schema.</p>
<p>There are also more complex image schemas that could be relevant, for instance whole-part, which is a little like a container, but where the elements don‚Äôt just have to be present, but also need to be arranged in a certain configuration for the whole to emerge. E.g. if you disassemble your car and still have all the parts, it‚Äôs not really a car anymore. (That‚Äôs also behind the layers example Kartik made in the other thread.)</p>
<p>Or take the center-periphery schema. This is how we understand gradual or fuzzy relations. Some things are ‚Äúcore‚Äù or central, and if you change them the thing is no longer the same thing, e,g. a tree where you cut the trunk is still a tree, but it‚Äôs not the same tree anymore. Other things are peripheral and can change, but if they do the thing still stays the same. E.g. if the tree loses all leads in winter it‚Äôs still the same tree. Oh, did you have a haircut recently? No problem, still you.</p>
<p>The difference between ‚Äúbucket‚Äù and ‚Äútag‚Äù can be as simple as container vs. link, depending on how you use it. </p>
<p>If the identity of an object changes when it‚Äôs modified in different places, does it mean it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be the same thing in the first place? This is at the core(!) of programming issues around value vs. reference types and affects your system design. What parts of the elements tagged or put into buckets can change without making them a different thing?</p>

Tagging to me is a kind of a categorizing/grouping. It's a type of non-exclusive container. Then I would put "bucket" as a separate image schema of exclusive container, which to me feels like a v important distinction. Mistaking a non-exclusive container for an exclusive container is surely to root of those spooky action at a distance gotchas.</p>

<p>To me the options that we didn't end up following seem as valuable as the chosen option, and those options should also be captured in code. A really easy way could be in separate branches, but then we loose visibility of them.</p>
<p>Is anybody familiar with source control software or with patterns to work with source control that also keeps tracks of options considered but not followed at the end?</p>

<p>Regarding documenting different options, usually we would consult the TDD or ask somebody, which is certainly not very approachable.</p>
<p>And if there was a clearly better alternative to implement something, usually we would describe it in TODO comment next to the implementation.</p>
<p>However, I wonder how often somebody really asks (why wasn't this done in this way), from my experience, I haven't seen that happening very often, at least not at the degree where reviewing all the previously considered options would be useful. But it does happen sometimes, and then TDDs usually worked out (but with lot of digging, figuring out the latest one and so on).</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud, I might on the other hand find it useful if they were more available, but it is hard to imagine right now.</p>

That seems like an interesting idea. The fundamental obstacle in my view is that a lot of those roads not followed will, by nature, affect the design of large swathes of the project, like whether certain files exist at all. It might be that the best thing is to add annotations, uh, somewhere, about where those branches' existence should be surfaced in the VCS or code browsing UI. E.g., somehow when you're looking at the router for your REST API, there's a button that shows the branch where you tried gRPC.</p>

You can use it to make little gameboy-like RPG games with point n' click coding (I wanted to make my own Pokemon obviously).</p>
<p>At first if I wanted something different to happen I just duplicated the map, so if you entered the forest, and went back to town you'd end up in an entirely new but identical map with characters saying new things. I had 100s of identical maps but the great thing about the RPG Maker is you could download and see inside other people games.</p>
<p>So I downloaded someone else's game and they only had one copy of each map and instead they used these things called switches (boolean values) to make different things happen after particular events. Soon my games had 1000s of switches. Eventually, I downloaded another game and it had barely any switches instead it had a single storyline variable that would increment by one every time something significant happened.</p>
<p>From there I learnt to use variables in more complex ways, and whilst I only pursued programming as a career fairly recently, I've used a basic level of programming with almost everything I do, and that's stuck with me as a foundation ever since.</p>

But it never really stuck.</p>
<p>As a college freshman I took intro to programming (also in java üò≠) but at the time I didnt really have a reason to want to learn to program so it never really stuck.</p>
<p>I started programming seriously my senior year. I became motivated to actually learn to program after I learned about people I felt were doing interesting things with computers (Bret Victor, Paul Graham, _why, David Nolen, Rich Hickey). I also felt motivated to learn because I was graduating from an unknown liberal arts school with a low gpa üòÖ.</p>
<p>I suspect for most people they need to first understand how they can use programming to do things that are meaningful to them (make games, music, money, ‚ÄúI want to be like x person‚Äù, learn things, etc.) in order to have the discipline to learn. I think starting with a domain specific tool for doing meaningful things like a game maker and allowing users to ‚Äúopen the hood‚Äù with programming is a good way to scaffold learning.</p>

However, my dad was always sure that it was the field for me (even though he had no computer knowledge either). So he bought me a computer book when I was in IX or X grade -- on dBASE III Plus. And I read it a few times over the next few years. In my freshman year I was declared CS but had no CS courses, and we weren't permitted yet into that holy of holies, the computer lab. But I could access computer books in the library. I read the K&amp;R C book and various others that year (including one that had an Alice in Wonderland theme throughout; I no longer remember the title, but I really enjoyed that one). But still without access to a computer.</p>
<p>I was pretty good at Math and Physics in high school, but it was pretty clear by the end of my sophomore year that computers were the thing for me: I never fell asleep in front of a computer the way I fell asleep over my textbooks for other subjects. And the feeling of flow was intensely pleasurable. In my junior year there was a contest to build an AI for a boardgame, and I won it by implementing A* search. So it seems clear that I must have had a few hundred hours of practice in that first year.</p>

Then also at school and with some friend's computer I continue Basic on computers like Sinclair ZX81, MO5 and TO7. I don't recall well all what I have created that time, just one thing: some program related to the 1986 FIFA World Cup (at that time I loved soccer) to show teams and results or something like that with some graphic part. I recall using some grid paper to figure out the pixels for the logo as I had to encode it pixel by pixel, there was no drawing tool at that time.</p>
<p>Later I owned my first computer an Atari 520 STF, in fact co-own because it was the family computer. I was amazed by the possibilities of the computer and in particular there was MIDI input/output which allows to use the computer for music and also to play network games (by connecting two Atari with MIDI). I uses mostly for games of course. But I also continued programming with Basic for some little programs every now and then.</p>
<p>During all that period it was in fact a bit frustrating, because several time I wanted to develop games, but it was very complicated at that time, and I have started some but never really finished one. But, in fact programming was my thing, so I was happy to create things whatever it was.</p>

I learned by experimenting and typing in programs from various magazines and having to debug the typos out. I can't really imagine that would be a good way to learn in 2020 tho.</p>
<p>To the original question though about Flash. My gut tells me it's easier and more interesting to take more complete systems and modify. I'm thinking VBA meets Unity (I'm sure this exists, maybe Roblox?). The point is if I have a simple game and I just double click an object in that game and add 1-3 lines of code to change something, I feel like that would be a more approachable way to start than the start from nothing way.</p>
<p>There was a failed kickstarter trying to teach coding in a game (not the same thing as above but similar)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=code+hero+kickstarter"></a><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=code+hero+kickstarter">https://www.google.com/search?q=code+hero+kickstarter</a></p>
<p>The distinction I'm trying to make from Unity itself (and maybe this not an important distinction, not sure) is that it seems more intuitive to just double click the object you want to edit and get presented with a function to fill out the same way VBA did for forms. That is not how it works in Unity. In Unity you add script components which give you a blank script and I think requires a lot more knowledge what to put in that script where was if it was designed for learning maybe there would be more direction or more or simpler and easily discoverable places to add small snippets of code to change things.</p>

My first actual programming was something called DarkBASIC. A sort of BASIC with DirectX bolted on. I don't think it was popular outside of the UK, but it used to come on the cover disc of PC Gamer. Probably picked that up around 13yo-14yo. Basically self-taught by editing example source code and seeing what it did. I remember when I first installed DarkBASIC and ran it, I thought it hadn't booted properly. I was like "It's just a blank screen? It's a text editor...? How do I make games". I literally closed it and opened it again several times üòÄ.</p>
<p>Before that (~11yo) I used to make games in MS Publisher that involved moving images around with the mouse (drag-dropping). Would have worked much better with physical paper, but I wanted it to be a "computer game". Before that (~8yo) I used to make mazes on paper which had sort of RPG-like elements e.g. a corridor with spikes along the side ("You have to go fast along this bit!!"). So I definitely think the motivation was to tied to kind of world-building creativity.</p>
<p>I separately loved puzzles and later, maths, and only a long time after learning to program did I realise there was a thing "computer science" that involved maths-like puzzles and thinking.</p>

Not politics, not an ‚ÄúUh it sucks!‚Äù conversation, but a serious discussion that‚Äôs highly relevant to the future of coding. This is a hard topic to discuss with the same rigour as computer science or PL design but I think it is one of the most important topics for this community to tackle.</p>
<p>To help bring some rigour to this conversation I‚Äôd like to bring up some incredibly important academic work which you can check out should you want to. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_capitalism</a> (these models aren‚Äôt in competition) are two of the best and most current models of economics, and could not exist without computing. They are both worthy of your time and have lots of explanatory and predictive power. They also point to a very important point for us: The technical challenge alone will not fix computing, nor will design. It‚Äôs not as simple as changing the incentives for companies or decentralising software, and not as straightforward as improving coding by a few orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>So, if we as a community want to change coding forever and for good, we must also understand the societal, political and economic context we exist in. I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts and discuss this but want to guide this conversation away from some pitfalls and towards productive conversation.</p>
<p>Things we don‚Äôt need to discuss:</p>
<ul><li>Personal opinions on wether capitalism sucks or not</li><li>Opinions on social media or corporate giants and their many problems or evils</li><li>The kind of discussions and critiques we have again and again all over social media around capitalism, Web 2.0, platforms, giant tech companies, etcetera.</li></ul><p>Some things this community could benefit from discussing:</p>
<ul><li>Concrete research and resources to learn more, inform ourselves and each other.</li><li>Ways in which we can facilitate true systemic change through our work here.</li><li>Questions that we think are worth exploring</li><li>Ways for this community to keep growing its understanding of economic context, the complex structures behind them, and improve our collective reasoning and decision making.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div> <div class="replies"><div id="2020-07-25T16:19:24.039Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Tim Lipp</span> <a href="#2020-07-25T16:19:24.039Z" class="date">2020-07-25 16:19:24</a> <div class="message"><p>My background started in sociolinguistics, financial auditing and economics. I came to Future of Coding after founding a tech company on a mission to reduce emissions by 50% for average Canadians, by leveraging gaps in the real-estate tech market and careful UX design. So this conversation is interesting to me.</p>
<p>It's important to remember how much the phenomena of surveillance capitalism and platform capitalism are not new, just the terms are. </p>
<p>One could argue that culture always has been the emergent "data essence" of a society, which different players (eg. Religion or the army) have used for their own ends. Viewing data and culture as a similar thing is helpful, because it allows us to apply known methods from culture conflicts to the world of surveillance. For example, parallels between decentralized cultures and decentralized data.</p>
<p>With Platform capitalism, how different is it really from what a market has always been? Every farmers market that is owned by a third party is effectively a two-sided marketplace that the landlord owns. 1,000 years ago the landlord had to guess if the merchant was making more money, and then could be gauged a bit more, now it's just digital and simple.</p>
<p>Digitization hasn't actually created the emergence of a new phenomenon, it's moreso increased the scale at which old phenomenon can operate. The world has become more flat. Everyone can be in every market simultaneously, even before we start employing barter bots. Even tinder allows me to be swept upon by matches 500k away after Covid-19....</p>
<p>Up to here there are 3 basic points I have:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>Data and culture are the same thing</p>
</li><li><p>Platforms are just digital markets with increased information access by the platform owner</p>
</li><li><p>The number of players in all games we play in the digital world, has grown exponentially</p>
</li></ol><p>So how do we enact systemic change for the good? </p>
<p>Firstly, I think it's inevitable. That's a whole other discussion, but it is not hard to see the cosmic arc of history's bent towards justice, or the innate human goodness that happens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months"></a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months</a>. </p>
<p>Inevitability aside, I then ask, "is it getting better for me." And that's the selfish side. So the way I make it better for me is by playing the game to accelerate the inevitable process. The diamonds are in the delta.</p>
<p>The three basic points guide the methodology within our organization to do that. </p>
<ul><li>Avoid building a global brand, build decentralized data aligned to cultural boundaries</li><li>Reduce the market's existence, eg. optimize for buying eggs at my neighbours backyard coop</li><li>Align all our metrics and system optimization on the one constraint a flat world hasn't made disappear: neighbourhoods. We all live somewhere. Design success in one neighbourhood, and scale it to neighbourhoods. Ignore other metrics.</li></ul><p>Along the way, I'm sure we'll get to test drive some pretty nifty tech solutions. üòú</p>

<p>To me, your second point seems incredibly important and easy to understate</p>
<blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Platforms are just digital markets with increased information access by the platform ownerI think there is danger in taking this to be something that‚Äôs been around forever, the increase in information available to the platform owners can be a monopolising force that we may not ever be able to escape incrementally. I‚Äôd argue we need more than just better company leaders if we want to change this, replacing Tim Cook with a generous anti-monopoly utopian thinker will only go so far.</li></ol></blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs been argued quite effectively that highly monopolistic power has been formed by tying producers and consumers together into one entity. This is evident on social media platforms such as Facebook, where your very consumption and interaction with the platform as a consumer is, to Facebook, a valuable production of resources in the form of data.</p>

<p>Why is it dangerous to view platform markets as just markets with more information? A small example happened 500 years ago with the invention of the receipt, it gave increased certainty for a transaction, but also added risk that information could be used against the parties involved.</p>
<p>Different cultures have different marriage norms. Some are polyamorous, some are monogomous, some even practice polyandry. If we were to equate Tim Cook to the perfect man, and profitable transactions to sex, are there healthy upper limits to profits as there are healthy upper limits to sex? Even if I have 20 lives, they can only make me so happy. </p>
<p>Perhaps the dilemma with profits is that the upper limits follow a much bigger power law than with other "wins" such as sex, and we haven't yet evolved an understanding of what the counterforce is. At the very least one exists in the reality that Tim Cook will probably get bored one day. Perhaps we could speed up the process by creating an even more interesting game to play.</p>

<p>I mean this moves at least into two directions: one - there are people starving to use tools in a sovereign way but they can‚Äôt because most todays tools do not allow for sovereign use . Two - In some regards many people here have already tapped into the cognitive science potential but it‚Äôs still unstructured and undirected - no new habits or actual cultural practices besides : text chat, twitter (social media) , YouTube ...have been created. </p>

</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[July 24th, 2020 5:51 PM] ivanreese: Thanks for the thoughts everyone. Here's what I'm thinking we could do, as a 5-part plan:</p>
<p><em>1.</em> <em>Rename &lt;#C5T9GPWFL|general&gt; to #questions-and-ideas</em></p>
<p>This is the channel for thinking out loud, asking questions, sharing ideas, brainstorming. Not for links, but otherwise identical to how we've been using &lt;#C5T9GPWFL|general&gt;.</p>
<p><em>2. Rename &lt;#C5U3SEW6A|random&gt; to #off-topic</em></p>
<p>This is the channel for things that aren't immediately related to the future of coding, but that would still be interesting to our community.</p>
<p><em>3. Rename &lt;#CCL5VVBAN|feedback&gt; to #your-work</em></p>
<p>&lt;#CCL5VVBAN|feedback&gt; is great to have, but I feel like it is ever so slightly too narrow in focus, and the renaming would make it broader. This channel would be the place to share whatever you're working on. Ask for specific types of feedback if you want it, or just share your latest blog post, newsletter, appearance on an (inferior, competing) podcast, etc. to reach our community as an audience and harvest fresh high-fives.</p>
<p><em>4. Create a new #stimulating-links channel</em></p>
<p>This is the other half of how we've been using &lt;#C5T9GPWFL|general&gt;. We'd use this channel to post FoC-relevant links to articles, videos, tweets, books, etc. made by other people outside our community.</p>
<p><em>5. Update the set of default channels</em></p>
<p>The default channels for new members will be:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ &lt;#CC2JRGVLK|introductions&gt;
‚Ä¢ &lt;#CEXED56UR|meta&gt;
‚Ä¢ #questions-and-ideas
‚Ä¢ #off-topic
‚Ä¢ #stimulating-links
‚Ä¢ &lt;#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week&gt;
‚Ä¢ #your-work
There are a bunch of other channels not included in the default set, to keep new members from being overwhelmed. Ignoring the location-based/meetup channels, the remaining non-defaults are:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ &lt;#CFQUMT7M3|1-on-1s&gt;
‚Ä¢ &lt;#CLYCGTCPL|end-user-programming&gt; 
‚Ä¢ &lt;#C0133ED5811|functional-programming&gt; 
‚Ä¢ &lt;#CE1R695T7|graphics&gt; 
‚Ä¢ &lt;#CGMJ7323Z|jobs&gt; 
‚Ä¢ &lt;#CEZ6QTHL1|music&gt;
Note that every channel, default and non-default, now starts with a unique letter of the alphabet. This should hopefully cut down on folks posting to &lt;#CE1R695T7|graphics&gt; instead of &lt;#C5T9GPWFL|general&gt; (which totally happens).</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of this plan.</p>

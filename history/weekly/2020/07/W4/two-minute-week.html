My current focus is on representing and rendering objects in space, so that includes things like: coordinate systems, affine transformations, cameras and perspective/ortho projection, vertex and fragment shaders on the GPU‚Ä¶ and then carefully abstracting all of this so that the artist using Hest will have the right degree of control, and can (for instance) have objects that encode their graphics in various formats (eg: HTML, SVG, glTF) which all coexist in the same space, efficiently.</p>

So some video watching, some chat, some reading, etc. And, some archeology on an old project with a bit of coding to refresh tiny parts and try new things.</p>
<p>It is what I then called zed, an editor highly inspired by PureData and Max/MSP but to mix visual programming with text programming for the web platform (and, sorry, no audio for now). The podcast episode with Miller Puckette (the father of PureData and Max/MSP) two month ago made me want to make a TMW video on this zed project, in echo of the discussions following the podcast (and didn't have time then): <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600</a></p>
<p>So here is a quick (2 minutes is really short...) presentation of this old project of mine which I will kept some ideas for my future work: <a href="https://archive.org/details/ogadaki_foc_tmw_1"></a><a href="https://archive.org/details/ogadaki_foc_tmw_1">https://archive.org/details/ogadaki_foc_tmw_1</a></p>

There's a few reasons: I need to write proper documentation and examples to make it useful and haven't got the time yet, also I still want to change some parts of it and don't want people/projects to dependent on it already. And furthermore I probably need some marketing around it to reach people. And then there's the business part I am thinking of (can I make a business out of my project so should I open source it at all). What are the thoughts here about open sourcing a project such as mine?</p>

I don't have it yet, but I was planning to add a way to stop all notes, and possibly individual synthesizers.  In terms of pattern, what I've seen is that each pattern has a name, and can be individually stopped/started.  I don't show it in the vid, but you can make different named patterns and play different synths at the same time.</p>
<p>In extempore you disable a pattern by using a different operator, I copied that by adding a ! after the pat command.</p>
<p>In the video I stop/start stuff because I haven't yet added the code to have the pattern wait for the next cycle before updating itself.  I think I'll need to keep the last pattern around until beat 0 comes around and swap in the updated copy.</p>
<p>I will refresh my memory on Tidal Cycles, and have a look at FoxDot/Ixi lang to see what they do too.</p>

<p>The options I'm aware of are:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Store and recreate the machine (or VM) state (registers, call stack, etc.)</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Some abstract representation of execution state (apart from the actual underlying one) that everything you care about saving runs on top of / is evaluated in terms of. (In other words, something like the demo you referred to).</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Something using coroutines (I don't remember the details)</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>In language where code can be serialized and later parsed and executed at runtime, and the execution context of each function call is reified into an object that can also be saved and restored in like manner, and the language itself (not just the code being written in it) is implemented in Continuation Passing Style (CPS), then the continuation itself can just be serialized and then deserialized and invoked as a function. ...

It can run regular Smalltalk images (from Pharo/Squeak/Cuis) inside the browser. It does actually run a graphical interface using BitBlt on a canvas. I like to use HTML/CSS and therefore run a 'headless' variant of SqueakJS. I implemented a plugin which does the DOM manipulation. All code (outside that plugin) is developed in a regular Smalltalk environment and the compiled bytecode (CompiledMethod in Smalltalk) is sent to the browser through WebSockets. Clients can send events (aka Announcements) back to the server.
The Smalltalk image in the browser is around 200Kb. This includes code to communicate, but not the UI classes. These are loaded on application startup (with every app needing its own classes) and can be done at runtime dynamically. Only load what is necessary.</p>

<p>Mini rant on prototypes. While a prototype like this would possibly be less work to build on say Python, I think building it atop Mu provides some significant advantages. Research prototypes are not entirely throw-away; the goal with them is to accumulate learning even while the codebase churns. Because it relies on so few dependencies, Mu is more robust to bitrot. This makes it easy for someone else to reproduce an experiment. Even relatively far in the future. I really hope we can converge on a shared platform something like this for research prototypes. It does still need graphics and sound, though..</p>

It's still very much vaporware. The hazy plan is some combination of shell (<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/05.html"></a><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/05.html">http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/05.html</a>), awk (<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/13.html"></a><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/13.html">http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/13.html</a>) and lisp (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/bel.html"></a><a href="http://paulgraham.com/bel.html">http://paulgraham.com/bel.html</a>). But it'll stay interpreted so the implementation is easy to understand. To do anything that requires performance I expect people to write small pieces in the existing level 2 (with registers) that can then be glued together using level 3.</p>
<p>I'm not attached to any particular syntax for level 3, I just don't want separate languages for commandline vs scripts. And I don't want the commandline to accrete features without a coherent design the way shells historically did. In the fullness of time I fully expect a MuPy fork, a MuSmalltalk fork, and so on. I'd love to contribute to them if someone else starts them.</p>
<p>CPU architectures similarly will need their own fork. From <a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf">http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf</a> (section 2.1):</p>
<blockquote><p>Portability is explicitly a non-goal. Portability guarantees require extra effort to maintain, and can be particularly challenging for newcomers who may not be inclined to ensure their changes work on platforms they don't regularly run. Rather than attempt to fight a losing battle, we retreat from it entirely.
That doesn't mean it's somebody else's problem. I'm very interested in contributing to a RISC-V fork or ARM fork (which has been increasingly on my mind). But it's unlikely to be a priority in 2020 at least.</p>

<p>I find your choice to stay with hex and the choice to maintain the numerical op codes instead of mnemonics very interesting. I understand why you made those decisions, but it does seem intuitively "weird" to me.</p>
<p>Is it just because it's foreign to me and different from the status quo, or do those choices fundamentally make the language more or less clear in some way?</p>
<p>You already make a distinction between SubX with syntax sugar and SubX without syntax sugar. Is it worth it to add another layer of syntax sugar for translating bases (or translating mnemonics)?</p>
<p>I've been thinking about your mnemonics debate. IIUC, You are worried about ambiguity, but if it's a "separate pass" it could be easily user modifiable, allowing the user to choose names that are less ambiguous to them. You could have "syntax skins".</p>
<p>More layers of syntax sugar arguably goes against your principle, "It uses as few notations (languages, syntaxes, intermediate representations) as possible."
But it might help with the principle of "It focuses on encoding intention". Or at least encoding understanding. I'm not sure. I very easily fall into the trap of assuming "more productive" is equivalent to "better understanding".</p>

Since then I've gradually moved down the stack to:
* a C program calling ncurses
* a C program calling termbox, which is a simpler replacement for ncurses
* forking termbox to rip out stuff I didn't use, gradually understanding its internals, still sending patches upstream (<a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=20221"></a><a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=20221">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=20221</a>)
* dropping my fork of termbox and making syscalls directly. What was interesting here was realizing how few syscalls I need. ncurses actually doesn't do much for many features we associate with it, just prints bytes to stdout.</p>
<p>Bottomline: ncurses is quite old, and a lot of the stuff it does was valuable in a world where everyone had thin terminals and very slow internet connections to their servers. It manages an in-memory copy of the screen just so it can compute the minimum it needs to change and send only those bytes over the wire to the server. But for most of us it now runs locally and there's nothing to send. It's all complexity we pay for but don't need. Another source of complexity is support for a huge database of ancient terminal types, none of which anyone uses anymore.</p>
<p>So check out <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/103screen.subx.html"></a><a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/103screen.subx.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/103screen.subx.html</a>. It's been quite a journey to boil ncurses down to ~300 static instructions of machine code. And there's exactly one <code>ioctl()</code> in there, see if you can spot what it's needed for.</p>

Your journey with ncurses and termbox is fascinating. Thanks for sharing. I've tried both for some toy side projects, including dealing with bindings to other languages. TBH, even at the api leveI, I came to similar conclusions. They were big dependencies and I ended up having to manage most of my own state anyway. There was a point where I was looking into creating a terminal emulator, and I ran into the "huge database of terminal types" problem. There is an almost absurd backwards compatibility burden these things impose. It's such a weird artifact of history with seemingly little modern benefit.</p>
<p>This is a tangent, but there is a lot of hidden conservative corporate politics that keep that stuff alive. The recent news about Cobol programmers still being needed for maintenance should tell you that these old mainframes and their dumb terminals are still around, and have a surprisingly long shelf life.</p>
<p>Re: <code>ioctl</code> Damn screen size 😛 you could just force a fixed terminal size. It would be like programming a graphing calculator. It adds to the authenticity of the experience /sarcasm. (I'm full of terribly bad jokes. Ignore me and don't actually do this lol.)</p>

<p>This, incidentally, is also why I try to minimize syntax sugar: any part of the pipeline that emits error messages can be confusing if the code it's referring to was generated by some syntax sugar it's oblivious to.</p>
<p>That said, syntax skins that don't persist in the source code could be interesting. None of this stuff is black and white. SubX does use syntax sugar, as you point out. We just have to take costs into account. I don't yet feel confident that I am estimating costs right in any of my design choices so far. That'll require a newcomer to actually spend time with Mu and tell me how easy it has been for them to learn/retain.</p>

<p>You have definitely made me question some assumptions I had about assembly language. I intuitively want mnemonics. I think your worry about making the user have to look up extra tables in their mind may not be as big of a problem as you think (especially if you provide good documentation). But you bring up some really good points about the implementation complexity, especially around error messages at this level.</p>
<p>If you do support mnemonics, also supporting a base 10 to base 16 translation seems like a natural next step. The two syntax sugars compliment each other.</p>
<p>There is probably still value in having a base 10 translation pass without a mnemonics pass, but maybe less so.</p>
<p>"That'll require a newcomer to actually spend time with Mu and tell me how easy it has been for them to learn/retain."</p>
<p>lol. I get the hint. Curiosity might get the better of me and convince me to pull the repo and play with Mu. But I make no promises 😏</p>

This allows for a few things I think I'll like, such as:
• Depth (with DOF/volumetrics to limit visual noise/clutter) separates different working spaces akin to tabs in a text editor. Switch spaces by moving back and forth through Z. I don't plan for this to be truly spatial —&nbsp;rather, spaces can come and go as needed.
• Splines can be used to show connections between spaces separated in Z. Splines, like spaces, will come and go as needed. My goal is that, even if points can be "teleported" or "jumped" without wires, there should be a way to visualize the movement using a transient wire. Nelson's "show connections" is a Hest doctrine.</p>

So some video watching, some chat, some reading, etc. And, some archeology on an old project with a bit of coding to refresh tiny parts and try new things.
It is what I then called <em>zed</em>, an editor highly inspired by PureData and Max/MSP but to mix visual programming with text programming for the web platform (and, sorry, no audio for now). The podcast episode with Miller Puckette (the father of PureData and Max/MSP) two month ago made me want to make a TMW video on this zed project, in echo of the discussions following the podcast (and didn't have time then): <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1589265827352600</a>

<p>So, this is an old prototype. Is this the project you're going to be working on full time now? Or are you starting something new from scratch that takes this as one of its inspiration?</p>

And I will polish a bit this prototype to fix some glitches and try to explore its possibilities as far as I can, but it will stay as a prototype. In part because the code base is very old (I have used some pre-standard Web Components).
So you are right: I am starting something new from scratch and also from Scratch (bad pun intended, sorry 😄) that will use the good parts of zed (I will then have to carefully choose what to keep).</p>

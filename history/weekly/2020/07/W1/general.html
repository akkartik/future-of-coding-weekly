Instead of a webcam in the lower left corner, he had the pointcloud data of his face from a Microsoft Kinect rendered B&amp;W with a slowly orbiting camera. When he needs to step away from the computer, he runs a generative video experiment of mutated VHS footage as an interstitial. His game looks like ghosts coming out of TV static. He plays music that would fit right in with (and is often made by) the people behind <a href="http://musicforprogramming.net">musicforprogramming</a>. His streams are both a thing you can watch with full attention, and something to put on in the background while you work to feel like you're in the most Lynchian/Gibsonian coworking space. He's put a lot of thought and effort into the look and feel of his streams, his game, etc.</p>
<p>He also codes slowly, and mostly does print debugging, and struggles with dumb bugs. I think that's just... programming, today.</p>

He was pretty difficult to work with, and the late Larry Tesler once told me that he was the worst boss he ever worked for. You can tell when you are in a dictatorship because there is no visible #2 waiting in the wings. And the cadre of VPs and lawyers underneath him at Apple were litigious and quite vindictive.  But putting aside his personal foibles, the man was passionate about quality and tried to make things easier for the customer and he also created a publishing system with the iPhone App Store, that is the largest employer of independent programmers in the world. Nobody has ever been nicer to indie developers than Apple. When Jobs started the App store, at the time the only indie friendly publishing outlet was the Amazon Kindle bookstore, which paid a 30% royalty. After jobs launched his store paying 70%, Amazon had to backpedal and match that royalty rate. The prior CDROM industry of which i was a big participant in was destroyed by software piracy, and it is impossible for a small developer to handle distribution in over 100 countries, but that is what you get with Apple. A deposit in the bank every month with no funny business, with all the currency conversions done for you. The App store sells more software than the entire US paper publishing industry by my estimates. Apple is fairly tyrannical, and will steal ideas for their products gladly, as they live inside a hermetically sealed spaceship, and never see the outside world. So i am not some starry eyed sycophant. But let's acknowledge the great opportunities Apple is giving to independents to earn an honest living. In the famous play "Major Barbara" by GB Shaw, he has some great essays on how letting people earn an honest living is very good thing.</p>

From my perspective, of engineer who has been in the world of startups and building products for some time now, the point I get from the quote is that when you start with an idea, you should be prepared for what comes next, and that is the idea changing a lot as you learn more about whatever you are working on. And while a lot of people have ideas, surviving through that process of change is much harder, and requires a lot of persistence and conviction to come through, if it is even possible.
Personally I enjoy hearing about how others navigated this process, as I am always trying to learn more about it and to be better at it.</p>

There is definitely a difference. You can innovate by exploring new design alternatives that are the opposite of what the mainstream is doing. If you make a series of these contrary design choices, you'll find yourself exploring a part of the design space where no one else is looking. It's not guaranteed that what you'll find is an improvement, but it's how real progress is made. We and our ancestor species spent maybe a million years doing iterative improvement on stone knives, and at the end... we had really good stone knives. It was the innovators who discovered metal forging.</p>

<p>I personally believe that the terms innovation and invention are used in situations where people are not seeing (or sharing) the true context within which an invention was merely an increment. In other words, innovation is largely an act of recontextualization.</p>

<p>The first, which typically happens in places shielded from commerce (e.g. universities, personal projects, rare industrial labs like Bell and Xerox), is a kind of mad-eyed push into the unknown that produces novelties.</p>
<p>The second is a process whereby people with good taste curate and refine those novelties, ultimately turning them into products.</p>
<p>I think of these two activities as a cultural analogy to seeding and harvesting. We need support for both of these modes to get the good stuff into general use.</p>
<p>When looked at from this perspective, Apple was one of the best harvesters we've ever seen in consumer technology.</p>
<p>(Aside: there's been an ideological shift since the 80s that attributes <em>all</em> value creation to harvesting, which in turn has led to a tremendous reduction in funding for seeders. This is my guess as to why we're still using 40 year old technology today.)</p>

<p>Sorry but Netflix is more than 25% of the entire internet and when you add all the streaming video guys together it is probably half the entire internet, and over time, will likely grow to 75%. If the internet had been designed with entertainment in mind, it would have been a lot more efficient to push video around. They didn't think about it much, and as a result we have a very wasteful system. Of course our communication systems should have as a design priority entertainment, because that is what people are using them for.  And it's none of our business to tell people what to do with their time. That is their free choice, and TikTok is evidently the answer for kids below 12 who are on that service for 80 minutes a day average.</p>
<p>The energy expended on stupid bitcoin proof of work is the biggest waste of energy on the planet, and just getting rid of that ridiculous thing would help.  Proving your worthiness by wasting energy computing nonsense values has to be the dumbest thing ever to catch on in a big way. Later generations will wonder what we were thinking. It was already more energy than all of Ireland 2 years ago, who knows what it is now.</p>
<p>Also, if we could crack the dumb monopoly that Google and the other browser companies have on only allowing JS in the browser, and let us use more efficient technologies, we could compile ahead of time our code, and not download massive tens of gigabytes to do a signon screen, that takes 100MB of RAM to run.</p>
<p>I can think of gigantic puddles of inefficiency in our current systems that should be addressed. We all should tread lightly on the earth, and leave it in a better condition than when we started. Computing is saving physical movement to a massive degree, but we can be a lot better.</p>

Blockchains represent a digital global consistent creation. The digital seems to human nature as something almost impossible to sense. Something very fluent , ethereal. So this global consistence gives people a more tangible handle for digital technology

It has lots of promise, but my two gripes were:
‚Ä¢ Comments, etc. are stored on codestream servers.  What if they go bust?  Why not inside a git file?
‚Ä¢ Issues can be created in code and created in git issues at the same time, but editing the issue afterwards doesn't sync up with the one in git.  I think these are mostly living on their servers
If this utility worked directly with git, I would pay for it.  Being able to edit git issues and have them highlighted on lines in Visual Studio would be awesome, and building documentation in a file on github by typing in code comments would also be great.</p>

I wanted to write about some very powerful techniques with jq that let you use it on any data format (xml, csv, yaml, etc) and even any data source (dbs, embedded systems, machine config). But it was really hard getting the wording right, and I couldnt make my deadline. So I just submitted the first part which were the basics of jq. Nothing exotic or original. Substack then messed up and delayed my newsletter by 90 minutes. Terrible post right? Well, it made the front page of hacker news, racked up 13k views (I usually get a few hundred), and almost tripled my subscribers. So, I'll try writing more tool tutorials, maybe people really find value there.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why do most popular systems seem to not care about [being small/simple/comprehensible]?
Popularity seems uncorrelated with remixability. At best some projects treat it like rocket fuel, to give a project an initial burst of contribution. But the mainstream view seems to be that what gets you to the big leagues is appealing to people who want to use an interface without trying to remix it. Grabbing the long tail of feature requests. Often these people are employed and using the interface to do their jobs faster or better.</p>

It has become entrenched in tech culture that that's just how you do things: you build a single product with a single team in control, so the only path available is to find the most common set of features and build those. The long tail of niche requests from smaller segments is effectively impossible and always ignored in today's most common way of building things.</p>

Many of these product-specific add-on APIs are actually quite limited. For example, maybe you can add new UI via an add-on, but it's trapped to a specific frame (Figma). These barriers get in the way of more creative, powerful ideas to remix and reuse software.</p>

The current way of building also makes such remixing quite hard to support on all sides (original team and remixers). The Basman and Tchernavskij paper "What Lies in the Path of the Revolution" (<a href="https://malleable.systems/catalog/#revolution"></a><a href="https://malleable.systems/catalog/#revolution">https://malleable.systems/catalog/#revolution</a>) goes into more detail on the many layers of obstacles currently in the way. I believe it will be a very long time before product teams wake up to the power of remixing, so I am instead building tools to take back control and enable changing and remixing without the original team's involvement.</p>

Coming from the perspective of games would I rather have 1000 systems from which I must choose 50-150 and then manually "mix them" (probably man years of work to really understand all the ins and outs of each system). Or do I just want Unreal/Unity which already made the choices and I can start immediately on the core of the experience I'm trying to provide instead of man years of engineering prep first. I'm not saying one is good and one is bad. Only that reasonable people can choose choose either the large system or the individual systems. Individual small flexible systems are not unambiguously better.</p>
<p>So, that to me is a counterexample to small mixable pieces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's rare to find good libraries that don't try to do too much or are flexible and off the top of my head I see at least 2 common reasons. Reason 1, the writer of the library is not experienced enough to write a simple, flexible library. Reason 2, the less experience you have the more you like handrails so there is both the incentive from yourself since you lack experience you think handrails are good and the incentive from the millions of inexperienced developers who will judge your library poorly if they need any coding experience to use it.</p>
<p>To give an example of this second issue, imagine any library that processes data. I think the experienced programmer (maybe you'll disagree) might prefer that the only input to this system is a an abstract "Reader" (or a function to read if you want to think in functional terms). The user can then provide a "reader" to read a file, read from memory, read from the network, and probably do that in as little as a 1-3 lines of code. This means the library is easily remixed in any environment.</p>
<p>But the inexperienced programmer doesn't know how to write that line of code to provide the reader so they'll hate on your library and prefer the one that takes a filename, or a network address or a binary array, or a websocket, and because of that the library will need to pull in 100k lines of support code for file i/o and networking etc... and therefore tying it to specific implementations of those features and then when someone suggests they need it to work with different implementations they'll hack in some afterthought of a configuration option instead of realizing they shouldn't have tied things together in the first place.</p>

<p>In today‚Äôs business-driven technology environment it seems success is tied to ownership of a platform or ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù. The idea of sharing and making things work with each other is severely limited.</p>
<p>It hasn‚Äôt always been that way. All these walled gardens run on core technologies that are open standards (Internet protocols, web standards, etc.) and wouldn‚Äôt exist without them.</p>
<p>How did we end up here? And more importantly, how can we swing back to a more remix-friendly environment? What creates incentives for that?</p>

Yeah, the crucial challenge here for me is that most customers don't truly internalize the value of openness beyond superficial aspects. As a result, an organization trying to truly do the right/sustainable thing is often at a disadvantage relative to one that's just performing 'open!'. For this reason I think the society we live in isn't mature enough for sustainable open commercial businesses in most industry segments. To get there we need a more appreciative, thoughtful audience/consumer base. Which isn't the sort of thing one can just magic into existence.</p>

(<strong>Kartik Agaram</strong>) User‚Äôs don‚Äôt care about open-source the same way they don‚Äôt care if your app uses blockchain and AI. Perhaps slightly different depending on how much sensitive data you put into the app (<a href="http://e.ga">e.g. </a>a note taking app). This is more relevant to the people here because FoC peeps seem to be especially interested in <em>end-user</em> software, whereas the successful open-source companies so far have been building developer infrastructure. Here, open-source is more of a requirement from the developers. ‚ÄúSuccessful‚Äù open-source end-user apps: LibreOffice, VLC Media Player‚Ä¶ GIMP</p>
<p>I really haven‚Äôt looked at these other open-source licenses, but I think Apache is generally the most business friendly. Not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with other licenses, but there‚Äôs an extreme power law distribution of them</p>

<p>We needed a standard for phones because everyone needed to be able to call everyone else. Now I can talk to people for free on 1000 different apps, emphasis on free. Someone tells me contact me on "Kik" (never heard of it) and I install "Kik" and start talking to them. As a geek I hate installing stuff and signing up for new services to be tracked but I'm going to guess most people don't think twice about it.</p>
<p>Standards can also stifle innovation because instead of just adding the feature you want you have to argue about it for years in standards committees. Sure maybe you can come up with some extension mechanism but then you're kind of back to the same thing, only people with your app can use your special extension.</p>
<p>OTOH I'm happy HTML exists and is a standard. It enables all kinds of things because it's in a standard format used in a standard environment. All the browser extensions like Rikaikun (japanese to english helper) and even Ublock Origin (the element zapper) and I'm guessing the password managers only work because everything is running in a standard environment with a standard data representation. If everything was native apps that ability disappears.</p>

* catching problems early
* controlling evolution over time ("what did I change recently?", "need to move slow now")
* controlling the space of inputs ("does the program still work in this situation?", "this feature adds too much complexity")
* controlling dependencies</p>
<p>I'm curious to see other people's lists, and whether anyone disagrees with one of my bullets.</p>

For example, ‚Äúcatching problems early‚Äù to one person might mean catching <em>typing</em> bugs, to which they might propose a strict type system, while to another it might mean catching <em>design</em> flaws, which might lead them to favor a more flexible type (dynamic or optional) system.</p>

I intended "controlling evolution over time" to mean just a low-level sense of tracking the past rather than maintainability in the future. Not that maintainability is unimportant, of course.</p>
<p>Your example is actually not that serious. I was deliberately trying to focus on the shared activities we perform as programmers rather than the diverse tools we may use to help us do them. Things that require manual consideration regardless of what tooling we may use to reduce the effort of acting on this consideration.</p>
<p>But yeah, it's clearly a question in progress, and I'm failing to articulate boundaries crisply. Basically I'm imagining a series of yes/no questions of the form "do you think about ___?" What would all programmers above some level say yes to that programmers below wouldn't? In what ways does the practice of programming rewire our brains? Quite possible my initial answers don't fit.</p>

People need to be given an understanding of what computers <em>are</em> and what they are capable of, probably through integrating some automation or similar into their ordinary workflows.  Advanced spreadsheets you use every day will inform your ability to understand that software exists and can be built and combined and changed a lot more than knowing how to write basic code that you never actually do in real life.  I fear that far from building the LOGO or etoys-inspired "computer culture" of Mindstorms we are instead teaching elementary students JS in the same way that the 80s taught highschool students BASIC -- and then none of them actually got any use out of it in their real lives</p>

<p>Can anybody do that today with software they didn't write? Even software they wrote a year or two ago? Substitute 'software' with 'spreadsheet' to taste. I sure can't claim anything like it. Any time I try to read somebody else's novel-length code I have to spend weeks to understand what it does. I imagine people from a thousand years ago may have felt the same way, laboriously reading a tablet character by character, tongue sticking out, trying to figure out where the word boundaries are, reading a line over and over again until the meaning sinks in.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I'm reading too much into your response.
I don't love this analogy. I think it misses a lot of the subtle issues here. It's important to realize that different methods of communication have a "knowledge bandwidth". Those viral gifs all communicated ideas that "could fit in a gif" so to speak. Your comment implies that we just need to find some better way of making an image that communicates the ideas better, but I suspect representing code might fundamentally be an idea that doesn't "fit on a gif". And that's not necessarily a bad thing! It just means we have to find other ways to communicate those ideas.</p>
<p>For the same reason, we didn't just stop writing books after we invented cinema. Different ideas work better in different mediums.</p>

<p>It's an interesting approach. Some people really do well with Duolingo (e.g. my wife has a 1000+ day streak).</p>
<p>I was watching her do a lesson and it was quite well structured. The questions were set up to test common beginner mistakes.</p>
<p>What I thought was nice about that is that if you get it wrong, the app can tell you exactly <em>why</em> you got it wrong (since they know exactly what bit of understanding they were testing, and control the answer space).</p>
<p>If you made the same mistake in e.g. a REPL, the error message might not be as informative.</p>

Imagine, if the results from a large number of students also fed back to language designers so they could make better decisions up front + perhaps trial new features and figure out if they were easy to learn - need to be careful - something might be hard to learn because it‚Äôs not taught properly too but sometimes the construct is complicated and perhaps there is a less complicated alternative</p>

<p>The most telling example for me was the part where the model made an error in the demo on the "compute_total_price" function.</p>
<p>First, note that it's guided by doc string comments. This very quickly devolves into a classic black box optimization problem.</p>
<p>I can easily imagine someone spending hours tweaking the wording in their comment to try and get the model to generate the right code. How is that better than what we do today where we tweak code or add annotations to try and get the compiler to produce more optimal code? This is worse because natural language is not nearly as structured (The search space is much larger) and the ML model is much more stochastic than an optimizing compiler.</p>
<p>Second, think about when, even after the presenter "fixed" the comment, the model produced code that was <em>almost</em> right, but had a bug. The 80% off instead of 20% off.</p>
<p>The presenter writes that off as no big deal, and in a small toy example like this it is easy to find and correct the error. But can you imagine that situation in a much larger code base? Or even a single moderately complex function? It's well known that reading code (and understanding it) is much harder than writing it. Anybody who has had to fix a bug in a dense legacy code base will tell you, it's way harder to find the bug than it is to fix it. Often, even if you were the original author!</p>
<p>This feels less like "pair programming" from the future, and more like "instant legacy code generation". üò¢</p>
<p>I think ML is good in general, but I personally feel like this is a case where more black box magic makes things worse.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA short look at the history of mathematics shows how justified this challenge is. Greek mathematics got stuck because it remained a verbal, pictorial activity, Moslem "algebra", after a timid attempt at symbolism, died when it returned to the rhetoric style, and the modern civilized world could only emerge ‚Äîfor better or for worse‚Äî when Western Europe could free itself from the fetters of medieval scholasticism ‚Äîa vain attempt at verbal precision!‚Äî thanks to the carefully, or at least consciously designed formal symbolisms that we owe to people like Vieta, Descartes, Leibniz, and (later) Boole.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúInstead of regarding the obligation to use formal symbols as a burden, we should regard the convenience of using them as a privilege: thanks to them, school children can learn to do what in earlier days only genius could achieve. ‚Äú</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen all is said and told, the "naturalness" with which we use our native tongues boils down to the ease with which we can use them for making statements the nonsense of which is not obvious.‚Äù</p>

Now, I agree with that of course. A formal system and rules to manipulate symbols are the ONLY way you can probably express a concept beyond any doubt and universally. So, as I mentioned, I do not think just naturalness and optimising a particular function is the ultimate answer. We may need to wait for the genius of  someone to come up with a solution to this problem. But the way I see it, this is the only way forward.

We should probably be moving towards being as precise as we have to be with computers with our language too. In this video, Sussman talks about how Maths notation is horrible - and that's maths. Natural language is worse. He argues that the legacy of programming is teaching us how to think precisely. </p>

Unfortunately when Jobs got rehired by Apple, the Next computer was tossed aside, as he had bigger fish to fry, and the tiny installed base of NextStep programmers were left adrift, teams disbanded, etc.  Then Lotus was sold to IBM which was the final blow because new products have great difficulty escaping the mediocrity machine that is the current IBM. I was around when IBM was the greatest company in the world, with constant breakthroughs of fundamental technologies. As others have pointed out Apple was a harvester of existing technology, but IBM invented things.  They had virtual machines in the 60's (CP/CMS), 30 years before VMware. Too bad they didn't push CP/CMS more, it was better than their lousy TSO time sharing system.</p>

There is a spreadsheet for Windows from a small firm that does very similar things; can't remember the name. It's a very expensive enterprise type of pricing product.  I know Mitch got rich from the sale to IBM, but I wish he hadn't because Lotus was a real high quality software company, and merging them with IBM was like what Vivendi did to Broderbund and the dozens of other educational software companies, destroy them in the end. Mergers among software companies have a nasty habit of destroying the teams that made the firm great in the first place.</p>

Maybe a nitpick, but this feels like a weird definition of intensional logic (here's a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/">better explanation</a>: intensional logic has to do with words having more meaning than mere reference). I don't think I want actual intensional logic in my sheets; I want referential transparency. I want 1+1 to always equal 2.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think there are some interesting ideas in the there although it feels like someone who doesn't use spreadsheets trying to fix them: excel has some tools like pivot tables, what-if analysis, and table objects that accomplish a lot some of what the author is asserting spreadsheets can't do...in addition to RC notation, that he admitted not knowing about.</p>

Recent research on this seems to be mostly focused on students and beginners, but the consensus (if there is any) seems to be that SH has negligible effects on source code comprehension (some examples: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2987491.2987536">1</a>, <a href="https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/fub188/21867/emip2017_report.pdf;jsessionid=D5D8345F061D423D87BB519F94D6B346?sequence=1#page=6">2</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-017-9579-0.pdf">3</a>).

<p>The authors of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-017-9579-0.pdf">2018 paper</a> (linked above) made the following claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings indicate that current IDEs possibly waste a feedback channel to the developer with an ineffective code highlighting scheme. This feedback channel could convey more meaningful information, for example the font colour could encode the type of function in terms of its namespace.
In other words, "semantic highlighting" could be more beneficial for programmer productivity, a paradigm that "attempts to reveal the meaning of the code" instead of just "identifying syntactic elements" [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2846680.2846685">source</a>]. This can mean something simple like giving each variable its own colour, but I think it can also incorporate more creative ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found two IDE packages for semantic highlighting: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndreasReischuck.SemanticColorizer">SemanticColorizer</a> for Visual Studio and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/semanticolor">semanticolor</a> for Atom. Has anyone here has used those packages (or something similar) and found them useful? I'm also interested what opinions you have about syntax highlighting in general (I've already read <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/hJHCAaiL0so/kG3BHV6QFfIJ">Rob Pike's opinion</a>). üôÇ</p>

<p>What I'd love to see, though, is a plugin that colors identifiers based on types, so that I can <em>see</em> how types flow through an implementation. I've created a couple images at some point to show this idea. I needed this when I was attempting to explain the implementation of a Cartesian product function to some people at a coding dojo.</p>

<p>The value for beginners shouldnt be underestimated because anybody in a new codebase or language is like a beginner. Having colors for keywords and meaning makes it easier to learn the language.</p>
<p>highlighting helps with writing code. I find it helps me identify typos while typing because the word is the wrong color. Similarly it helps me identify keywords I forgot were keywords.</p>
<p>Semantic highlighting can be thought of as something to strengthen code smell. If code looks the wrong color, it has a very bad smell that's easy to spot, whereas code with a single letter missing has a very subtle bad smell. </p>
<p>I'd imagine highlighting would be most helpful for debugging.</p>

On the other hand, take any lisp, I don't find highlighting tokens to be too useful at all, but I find myself doing a similar thing with the autoindenter, though rainbow parens are also great.</p>
<p>I personally find tooling quite important</p>

If the syntax highlighting is even slightly off, it really confuses me. For example, when I started learning Rust, the VS Code incorrectly highlighted some regular names as built-ins. So before thinking of "semantic highlighting", I think it's more important to do "correct highlighting" first. For most languages, this means that you can't simply use Regex highlighting rules.
I've used individually-colored names in Jetbrains products and liked it, but it wasn't a huge productivity boost. Rainbow-Parens are also helpful IMO.</p>
<p>When talking about syntax highlighting, it's usually about text / background color and font variants (bold/italic) only. My hypothesis is that source code readablility could benefit from using different fonts for different syntactic elements. Identifiers and literals could use a sans-serif font, documentation a serif one and keywords / punctuation a monospace font. I'm currently building a prototype that uses different fonts depending on the element type. I can hopefully show something next week.</p>

He discusses his system in his "monads and gonads" video. In it he uses color to signify scope. Here is a vscode plugin based on that idea:
<a href="https://github.com/azz/vscode-levels"></a><a href="https://github.com/azz/vscode-levels">https://github.com/azz/vscode-levels</a></p>
<p>I haven't used it myself, but I wonder whether non-traditional syntax highlighting schemes wouldn't have the same level of utility as traditional ones (which I agree is low; though I also use the "wrong" color as a signal that something is syntactically wrong with my code, there are better ways my editor can and does use to inform me of such problems).</p>
<p>There is a small set of limited colors that can be unambiguously used at the same time (say max 7ish), incidentally about the same as the limit of how many things I can hold in my head at the same time (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">7, plus or minus two</a>). This color limit is especially true if I'm using different colors for the same syntax elements (to indicate something other than syntax, such as scope or other semantics).</p>
<p>In order to program I need to build up a mental model of the code. Highlighting will only help me if it can extend the capability of my brain to do that beyond its natural limits, e.g. work with a partial mental model, supported by "color context", or help me build up a regular mental model more quickly.</p>

Now, I'm programming in C++, and I sometimes disable blocks of code using <code>#if  1 try this #else old code #endif</code> when I am experimenting with a new implementation. Vim colours the disabled <code>old code</code> differently, so I can quickly see that a large block of code is disabled even if I can't see the preprocessor <code>#</code> tags that disabled it. That's useful. Ditto for colouring block comments and multiline string literals. On the other hand, giving each token on a line a different colour is just visual noise.</p>

<p>I get starting from the native components for a prototype, but she obviously very quickly got the point where she outgrew the native framework, and continued fighting against the grain.</p>
<p>I have the intuition that she spent just as much if not more work by trying to stay with the native frameworks. I would have bailed much sooner in process and just used a game engine. She admits that she ended up having to re-implement much of the rendering components anyway.</p>

Docker et al is abused, true, but you are free not to use it, along with whatever other hairy mud jenga towers of complexity you may want to avoid cough systemd cough. I find that generally, among people I meet, the people the most enthusiastic about docker, etc are the ones that are the least comfortable with their package manager. You can have much simpler systems by just using packages and services, rather than containers. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that it's been a trend among programming languages to have utterly unholy build processes, whose brittleness make it hard to package things—but if you can't build the software in question, you can't patch it, and you probably shouldn't be using it in a container either. This issue isn't really the fault of any system in particular but rather of programmer trends, with programs like web browsers setting trends (and records) with their compilation resource usage and dependency chains.</p>

I would have preferred to only support static builds for Io, but so many useful open source libraries only supported DLLs and getting them to support (and maintaining that support) cross platform static builds was just too much work.</p>

Package managers fix this issue since good ones will track library dependencies and rebuild as necessary. I'm not sure what to blame for build system bloat really, it seems more of a cultural issue than anything—I understand that google has buildfarms for stuff like chromium so the core devs don't have to worry about it, I generally have trouble reproducing builds for any sufficiently complicated c++ program, and I'm not too sure why.</p>

<p>Of course it’s possible to layer more semantics onto graphs such as animating data flowing through edges, or coloring nodes, etc. But I love how far you can go with just nodes and edges and some movement.</p>

<p>The reason it's easier to transition programming languages is that that layer of language is small and insignificant. Beyond that, you can use the "same language" (say the same thing) in another programming language.</p>

We have 1202 users right now, so that's currently $9616. The number might be much higher when we hypothetically "get funding". Seems like a waste of money.</p>
<p>My suggestion is first to migrate off slack to another platform. Encourage everyone to delete their FoC slack accounts. Then, when Ivan is the only remaining user, then we migrate the data. It will cost $8.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to migrate to Mattermost, because it is an open source slack clone, and offers the smoothest transition.</p>

<p>In this case it's more about the problem and its constraints rather than dependencies, input space, etc.</p>
<p>The role of the language is to make these things clear (to human readers/writers) while also running efficiently (clear to the machine what optimizations it can/should take).</p>

The level of Chinese writing in this time period was bone oracle stuff. How on earth are they making conclusions about what the people thought in Zhou dynasty when there are no written records? Chinese block printing was the big invention that made things change in the Tang dynasty, 600-900 AD. That's almost 1000 years later. I have no doubt that in China's incredibly long history that numerous rulers didn't try to fix up corruption and inefficiency, but we have scant evidence of these older periods. We don't have surviving commentaries, mostly thanks to the Gang of Four who sent out teenagers with machine guns to erase all prior chinese history during the Cultural Revolution. I was studying Chinese at the time, and my father was going to send me to the University of Beijing. It was a very dark time for China. Taiwan has most of the old stuff, which was saved from destruction by the retreating armies of Chiang Kai Shek.</p>
<p>The only ancient civilization that has any good number of surviving written records is mesopotamia, because they wrote on clay tablets of which we still have around a million. There are people who can read those tablets as casually as a newspaper.</p>
<p>There were ancient civilizations in other places, but we have to guess from pottery shards and their trash heaps to figure out what they were up to. Not very direct information.</p>
<p>The #1 factor causing societal collapse is cheating. Archeology is the study of the collapse of civilizations, and it is a shame that the Archeologists which know full well what causes collapse only talk to each other in academic conferences and journals.</p>

She was very fond of Hammurabi, who was a very upstanding guy. He did one or two debt foregivnesses, to stave off collapse of the government, because back then when you owed money you or a family member became a time-limited indentured servant, and during that time you aren't earning any taxable income. If enough people (like over 50%) get into that state and don't feed the govt, it collapses. Anyway there are many parallels with today, and we are indeed flirting with collapse.</p>
<p>Hammurabi's code, is incredibly strict, and is all about paying people proper wages, setting interest rates, personal injury liability, etc. But another kind of cheating is the concentration of political power into ruling families. My sister had studied the marriage records, and found out that the high officials were stuffing their relatives into cushy govt positions (nepotism). Anyway whether its crony capitalism, medical malpractice, debasement of the currency, there is nothing new under the sun, and Babylon in the year 3000 had the same problems we have today.</p>

It was a  wonderful, very productive, extremely easy to understand tool. I peeked at the code, and it is a tangled mess of TypeScript, with a huge number of modules. Sad that a rebirth of a product like this is probably several times more complex than the original Hypercard, which i would guess was written in Object Pascal. Of course Atkinson was a genius programmer, so we can't expect the same elegance, but some of this mess is attributable to the usage of TypeScript, which in this project gets expressed as many individual modules that have lots of cross-imports.  Any time you  have more than 100 source code files you start to realize that file-based organization hinders comprehension. I think this is one of the big expected payoffs of the graphical programming approach; one big glob instead of hundreds of files must surely help understanding of the whole.</p>

It also showed the potential and limitations of graphical development. Code naturally wanted to be in objects, but for logic that didn't fit in visual objects, it became a challenge. I'd have a mix of hidden objects and really large card and stack code modules. That couldn't have been good for comprehension by future devs. The one thing a file-based approach does is surface the entire topology in one glance: via the folder hierarchy. (Well, and the dependency graph - so two glances)</p>

She boldly claims that public university funding is in dramatic decline since Reagan. Here is a graph of the raw and inflation adjusted University of California budget. Do you see a decline lately? Nope, just keeps going up and up. Some UC administrators have 8 figure salaries, and fly in private jets.  If anything, higher education in America is decadent, and out of touch with reality. All scientific evidence on education shows that the most bang for the buck happens before the age of 8, and that college, which used to be about learning to shoot pool and drink beer has never justified the outrageous funding it currently receives.</p>
<p>She mentions all sorts of problems, without mentioning price/performance. Too busy pursuing social justice to measure if the universities' core mission, which is to educate people, is being done in an effective or frugal manner.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the concern for the quality of the graduates being produced?  Shouldn't that be the #1 concern? I have deep reservations about the quality of programmers being produced in the schools. Some of them can't program their way out of a paper bag.</p>

<p>public university funding (i.e. funding of universities by the state and national government) <em>has</em> specifically declined, and tuition costs have ballooned in response. the University of California is one of the strongest examples of this trend – see e.g. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-lost-decade-in-higher-education-funding"></a><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-lost-decade-in-higher-education-funding">https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-lost-decade-in-higher-education-funding</a></p>
<p>you’re right about the outrageous rise in salaries for upper administrators – this is a widely recognized problem among university faculty, and is driven in large part by higher ed being treated more and more like a business rather than a public good. decent public funding (like they have in many other civilized countries) would also justify stronger public control over what the money gets spent on.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some UC administrators have 8 figure salaries, and fly in private jetsThat’s insane, holy shit.</p>
<p>Some of them can’t program their way out of a paper bag.This is quite true. With the large influx of students interested in CS due to it being trendy, the degree meaning has degraded. I met many developers who are dipl. ing. and yet are junior level mindset because they learned to optimise for learning to pass the curriculum, not to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming from a country where higher education is free if you are a regular student and you “pay as you fail” - it is a great solution, but it yields a huge diploma inflation. Everyone has a university degree, most do optimised learning just to pass, colleges love it because they get more money from the gov and more students, students love it because they all get diplomas easily. The academy became a super-slow turtle where people join as they graduate for a “doctorate”, yielding them like 2.5x median salary and having them work on useless stuff with their mentors (like, we’re analyzing bitcoin transactions to see how much total volume there was last year). Dozens of them drip in per college year, rarely anyone returns to the private sector. Some professors have monetized it by having students work on stuff that is relevant to companies they partner/work with so students get hired there and teachers get a comission.</p>
<p>In the end, the lack of quality graduates is showing in the industry.</p>
<p>Re: Amy Ko’s article</p>
<p>Totally agree, sexism and elitism are prevalent in CS. I’m glad to see more women in CS classrooms, because having just 2-3% of the classroom being women was causing a quite toxic culture. In the last 8-9ish years since I started/dropped college, worked, held talks on unis, I’ve seen quite an increase here and I can say that the working culture changed to waaaay better and way less “bro-like”. I cannot speak much about racism from experience since we have a really low percentage of non-white people in our country, but by looking at the outside world, I see why racism is quite in play.</p>
<p>But yeah, Academia has a serious issues with gatekeeping - and it’s broken bottom up - not open for the most intellectualy curious, but reserved for those who can endure to finance themselves that long and who will gladly jump through the hoops and play politics.  And the idea that we don’t need liberal arts is so self-absorbed - programming is an art and it impacts and changes our society quite a lot. I’d say we get quite a lot of problems due to engineering - engineers usually have more stricter and boundary/box making mindsets. Not saying it’s bad, but it doesn’t fit the artist culture of programming and now the culture is growing up and rejecting the engineer label</p>

I should really go back and turn the project outline bits into a blog post.</p>
<p>There's also no code online yet. I want to have a working compiler and editor before I publish a first draft. So far, I've got an on-disk format and a read-only visualizer.

<p>A: My feeling is that where we stand now, we cannot evaluate this claim. It may be true, but as long as the forces of discrimination and biased perceptions affect people so pervasively, we’ll never know. I think the only way we can find out is to do one more experiment. We should allow all of the evidence that men and women have equal cognitive capacity, to permeate through society. We should allow people to evaluate children in relation to their actual capacities, rather than one’s sense of what their capacities ought to be, given their gender. Then we can see, as those boys and girls grow up, whether different inner voices pull them in different directions. I don’t know what the findings of that experiment will be. But I do hope that some future generation of children gets to find out.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Soviet experiment had run into exactly the difficulty that Plato's admirers encountered, back in the fifth century BC. The recipe called for rule by heavily-armed virtue -- or in the Leninist case, not exactly virtue, but a sort of intentionally post-ethical counterpart to it, self-righteously brutal. Wisdom was to be set where it could be ruthless. Once such a system existed, though, the qualities required to rise in it had much more to do with ruthlessness than with wisdom. Lenin's core of original Bolsheviks, and the socialists like Trotsky who joined them, were many of them highly educated people, literate in multiple European languages, learned in the scholastic traditions of Marxism; and they preserved these attributes even as they murdered and lied and tortured and terrorised. They were social scientists who thought principle required them to behave like gangsters. But their successors -- the &gt; vydvizhentsy&gt;  who refilled the Central Committee in the thirties -- were not the most selfless people in Soviet society, or the most principled, or the most scrupulous. They were the most ambitious, the most domineering, the most manipulative, the most greedy, the most sycophantic. Gradually their loyalty to the ideas became more and more instrumental, more and more a matter of what the ideas would let them grip with their two hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way, the surprise is that Bolshevik idealism lasted as long as it did. Stalin took his philosophical obligations entirely seriously. The time he spent in his Kremlin library was time spent reading. He held forth on linguistics, and genetics, and economics, and the proper writing of history, because he believed that intellectual decision-making was the duty of power. His associates, too, tended to possess treasured collections of Marxist literature. It was one of Molotov's complaints, after Stalin's death, that by sending him off to be ambassador of Outer Mongolia, Khrushchev had parted him from his books. And Khrushchev, in his turn, tried his best to talk like the great theoretician one magically became by elbowing and conniving one's way to the First Secretaryship. It came even less easily to him, but the transition to utopia by 1980 was all his own work. He was not a cynic. The idea that he might be committing an imposture bothered him deeply.</p>
<p>Stalin had been a gangster who really believed he was a social scientist. Khrushchev was a gangster who hoped he was a social scientist. But the moment was drawing closer when the idealism would rot away by one more degree, and the Soviet Union would be governed by gangsters who were only pretending to be social scientists.</p>

This version here makes certain guarantees, but if you upgrade or do a git pull, all bets are off. It might delete a function you rely heavily on. Or it may make it work differently one time in a thousand[8] and cause subtle, insidious bugs." - I would argue that this is already true. I have been DevOps and Uptime lead at my current company 90%+ of the time I have been there. Top 3 things that caused me nightmares were upgrading library dependencies and deploying to production. That s*** goes south in subtle ways you don't catch until users hit it. I've actively campaigned for more automated testing and fewer dependencies for a significant chunk of time.</p>
<p>So, your argument to embrace testing resonates with me. I suppose I would say, we should just embrace the facts on the ground and assume everything will break and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>At first, its small and flexible. You can change it and add new features with reckless abandon. Eventually, people start to depend on the software's behavior and you're less free to change it. Unused features atrophy and fall away. Over time, the code builds up cruft and starts to rot. Between the technical dept and user demands, the code rigidifies. You can keep it limping along, but it shows its age. Eventually, some new projects are written that take up the burden the old code base was carrying, and the old code can be deprecated and eventually dies.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to figure out how to build the evergreen project, but to an extent the macro software ecosystem is immortal, its just individual projects that rise and fall.</p>

The "agency in the small" stuff is giving me Stafford Beer vibes, have you read his stuff?</p>
<p>The idea behind your proposed system is interesting, but it is doomed to fail without extremely high median information hygeine, which as of 2020 looks like a fantasy among the general public.</p>
<p>Personally I am (more than a bit) cynical, and so am convinced that the only way out of global tyranny is accepting local tyranny (as a result of local agency), and that that such a task was pretty much rendered impossible with the industrialization and rationalization of society, which has made geography mostly obsolete.</p>
<p>To be a bit more topical, as it relates to computing, one big step for me was to consider software systems holistically, as a kind of ecology—they live, die, revive, all as a process. There is no such thing a a static piece of software, since you must consider the interactions surrounding it. While I do have more to say here (probably too much and too poorly), I will defer to Faré, who refined his writing for years: <a href="https://ngnghm.github.io/"></a><a href="https://ngnghm.github.io/">https://ngnghm.github.io/</a> </p>
<p>However, one conclusion I will draw is that that there is no "evergreen system" as systems are no static throughout time—even from the reductive standpoint of systems theory, the very inputs and background in which it operates change over time, and the classical maxim applies: Garbage In, Garbage out. For a system to be truly evergreen, it must adapt—it must be a full ecology. And so that reduces the problem of building such "evergreen software" to classical coordination problems in politics, which (admittedly anecdotally) have proved to be intractable so far. We don't know how to do ecology, and on some days I doubt we ever will. We can only try our best amd hope for the best.</p>

Say it is defined over some abstract high-dimensional state space, then there is some desirable region in that state space such that you want the system to stay inside for all possible inputs. While this is possible, with the classical example being things like strange attractors, it is in general highly unlikely. In general, the kinds of mechanism design we have access to and understand are incremental in nature, such as systems of checks and balances, etc. These can be represented as filters on the system. By nature, they are limited to only some range of validity and cannot dampen arbitrary input in a desirable way, which is what we would want.</p>
<p>Well I said I would try to be a bit more concrete but this still reads as obscurantist drivel, oh well. I'm not very good at writing.</p>
<p>At any rate, the only solutions to this problem have to be radically simple in nature, stuff like <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a> wanting to exchange full software stacks, or Alan Kay wanting to computers to be self-decoding. I also think forking is underrated, and would be much more useful if it were not for all the incidental complexity in programs—people should be able to rewrite software as they see fit, in an incremental fashion, and without having to take on large burdens like software maintenence, etc. Again, software-as-ecology is sorely deficient. And, of course, the solution is not something easy, after all Alan Kay and other smart people have been wrangling with these problems for over 50 years with no complete solution in sight (at least, I think so, Kay is hard to read on purpose).</p>

For my MicroCISC processor, I have found there are several different directions I can take it and it isn't at all clear to me which one is the best or has the best outcomes. But, since the code is in Git, the trunk branch represents the canonical implementation of MicroCISC and the best I can do is create other branches that have alternatives.</p>

Maybe you don't want the syntax sugar I added or some other feature I added to the language, or the compiler or perhaps something more fundamental like the number of registers.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, I can't decompose it easily in a way that let's you pick the parts you want and mutate the direction of the development in some other manner. The typical approach would be to either take what I have and "wrap" it or "extend" it. But then we have frozen the interface and I can't change it without breaking either in a way that may break your system altogether.</p>

To the extent that death and regeneration are a part of life I'm not trying to subvert them. I really like Joseph Schumpeter's ideas of creative destruction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction</a>).</p>
<p>The problem I see is that entities often live too long, outliving their original purpose. Governments grow corrupt, companies turn into monopolies, bureaucracies get captured (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a>), open source projects make user-hostile changes or refuse to consider reasonable patches (/s 😉). Corrupt governments eventually die, but the process is painful and can require bloodshed. Monopolies eventually die, but can cause a lot of pain to their customers and the commonwealth before they do. Bureaucracies eventually get replaced and defunded, but they live the longest of all. Open source patches are eventually replaced, but they live longest of all because of the troubles of testing a new dependency (/s 😉).</p>
<p>So the problem, the way I see it, is to create incentives for capitalist endeavor, but not allow them to grow too far unboundedly. A high top tax bracket is one fairly blunt way to achieve this. Authoritarianism that sometimes goes by the name of Communism (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge</a>) is an even more blunt approach. And the blunt ways are not sustainable. Tax brackets get loopholed to death or lobbied to death. Communism gets outcompeted outside its borders because it leaves no incentive for endeavor, while being just as prone to corruption internally as anything else.</p>
<p>No, the most natural way to keep outcomes bounded is to increase competition. And you can't will competition into existence, regardless of Anti-trust laws and Patent laws. The most natural way to foster competition, IMO, is for people to be educated about the geopolitical effects of their actions. If you see this thing you use get too popular, it should be easy to switch to the next most popular thing. If there isn't one, it shouldn't be too difficult for someone to create. And if you see no competition for some good, maybe you should be more careful about growing addicted to it. It's not lack of payment that makes you the product, it's lock-in.</p>
<p>One can argue about whether the presence of competition beyond some point leads to death or an evergreen organism. If a country can swing from socialism to capitalism every ten years or so, is it dying painlessly at each bloodless revolution or just evergreen? If a company can reinvent itself to go from selling adding machines to computers to computer services, is it dying at each of those phase boundaries or really 110 years old? Imagine a bureaucracy that grows an arm to disrupt itself everytime it starts to grow lethargic. Or an open source project whose users can easily swarm to a new fork when the old one stops meeting their needs.</p>

<p>I have read Faré's blog, though it's been a while. I always enjoyed his writing but as I recall, he's a lot more on the evergreen side of the spectrum than me, trying to find the perfect one-size-fits-all technical architecture, anticipate all future problems, that sort of thing. My goal is to architect just enough to allow me to get to the social technology. (Too bad the term 'social engineering' is taken.)</p>

But I don't think the bottlenecking problem is bad information. This fake news stuff is a short-term issue, IMO. No, the real problem is not asymmetric information but asymmetric capacity for critical thinking. A population that can perform simple probabilistic reasoning, detect statistical fallacies, read someone else's codebase, that's the hard problem here. (I can do none of those things.) I think Alan Kay might agree.</p>

<hr><p>I really liked your example about the state space. See <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/modularity"></a><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/modularity">http://akkartik.name/post/modularity</a> for a similar thing I wrote. But yeah, your diagnosis is right that I build simple systems in hopes of avoiding all the hard bits of the state space. Yes, there may be monopolies in spite of everything I do. But hopefully they need to create a lot more value before they can pass that threshold. Some programs may still have to deal with really large state spaces. But if we monitor state space size hopefully we can eliminate over-engineering and be parsimonious about such state-space explosion.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly. Current tools aren't great though. In the future what I'd like to see is version control integrated with the reflective capabilities of software, whether it be through debuggers,  typechecking, testing, contracts, layers, etc. Unison has a very interesting approach to this problem by hashing code AST directly. That said, I do think the bulk of things cam be agreed on, and should be agreed on, at least at the level of some critical mass. I'm thinking of software like emacs, which is extremely malleable, but still has a core set of stuff people generally don't mess with.</p>
<p>As for mastodon, yeah it's a mess I have no intention to touch with a 20m pole. Couldn't even implement DMs in a sane way, it's irresponsible. Somehow pleroma, which appears to have a saner backend, has an even slower than twitter frontend, etc etc. I'm,not one to post stuff publicly anyway. I'm just really happy <a href="http://nitter.net"></a><a href="http://nitter.net">http://nitter.net</a> exists, keeps me sane.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a> You're point about entities living too long is exactly on point. I'm not too sure about the parts on capitalist endevour, mostly because I'm skeptical monetary incentives can really motivate after a point, even when it might be necessary. For example, I blows my mind how fast software rots, the only people who seem to produce finished software are hobbyists, mostly because that can't afford not to. I suppose with enough competition the kind of wasteful behavior you see in tech today wouldn't be an issue, but then barriers to entry become an issue. I agree about competition, but I think another key part is to raise the floor for people to build things, thougg that's largely more of a purely societal issue. It's funny, because the way I see it, it's mostly an allocation problem—even after all the bad things I said about mastodon earlier, it doesn't change the fact that it is thriving, and on a fraction of the budget twitter has. I would handwavely estimate that you probably would need significantly less than a single major vc round to really fix a lot of fundamental issues in software if they were allocated to the right people. It still blows my mind that significant amounts of core infrastructure is maintained by people who are probably less well-off than me, I have seen people maintaining foss projects used to make millions that have core developers that have trouble getting food on the table.</p>
<p>I also agree about education, after all every human institution is made up of people, no matter how easy it is to forget. There's no point in discussing institutions if you don't give the people in them agency.</p>
<p>Also fully agree about lock-in being the big bad.</p>
<p>On death vs. evergreen, I'd be firmly on the evergreen side, that's ecology working as intended.</p>
<p>As for Beer, you should start by reading Designing Freedom. He's kind of handwavy when it comes to concrete actions, but his conceptualization of things helps me a lot.</p>
<p>Faré himself has written about how he's more of a navelgazer ;)</p>
<p>Regarding information, I agree that critical thinking is the harder problem, in fact I think the current information landscape (infoscape?) 's issues with constant semantic denial of service style attacks is solvable with current technology and a lot of social work. Education is hard and my intuition tells me that the world would have to be close to completely unrecognizable for it to even begin to be a tractable problem. A good start would be raising the floor economically and socially, along the lines of maslow's hierarchy. At the end of the day, if people don't want to be educated, what are you going to do about it? I was reading James Scott's Art of Not Being Governed recently, and he makes the point that you can consider illiteracy as an adaptation to exit civilization and stay out. We quickly end up with thorny normative issues regarding big words like freedom, human rights, etc. That said, I do think that the more pressing issue is hygiene, I am worried that such an parasitic infoscape entities may become too deeply entrenched if we don't fix the issue soon. Technology has a tendency to stick around and reify our past mistakes, and the stakes only get higher.</p>
<p>As for state space, my crux of my point was that although I don't think it's hard to get into the desirable state space region, it is exceedingly hard to build institutions that stay in it, and I think it's impossible in general. So you want to be able to able to move through your state space is a discontinuous fashion when necessary (i.e more radical measures, like a rewrite). Simple is important for discontinuous changes, because otherwise they aren't possible.</p>
<p>Your idea about unit tests is interesting because it reduces the size of the state space. Something that I'm looking forward too over the next decade is seeing dependent typing and theorem provers coming into the mainstream, and seeing if someone can distill something nice and simple out of it. I was learning F* earlier, and it's quite neat technology.</p>
<p>The general version of your unit tests idea is that we need better, more consistent and reliable ways of encoding the behavior of our programs in our programs, this kind of reasoning is usually called reflection but I hesitate to use it due to the association with stuff like eval(). This is closely related to metaprogramming, because we need to write higher-order programs, just like we have higher-order logics to encode behavior of lower-order logics. We have a very developed syntactic metaprogramming in the lisp tradition, but metaprogramming with semantics is still quite underdeveloped, I have a hunch this is related to foundational issues in mathematical logic though so I'm not sure if this will ever take off. At any rate, people are kind of working on it with stuff like multi-stage programming, and I'm excited to see them become more expressive.</p>

<p>One comment, in reply to <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">Kartik Agaram</a>'s note about organizations outliving their utility, which I think is related to code as an element of social coordination. The common point is that organizations, like code, are set up as a rule-based system in a particular context and for achiving a specific goal. But predicting the outcome of complex rules over long times is impossible, and therefore both institutional rules and code must be revised regularly as the outcomes of their application becomes apparent. And often works well for a time, while the rules are new and their original developers are aware of their weaknesses. The next generation takes the rules as something sacred, and preserving them becomes a priority, no matter the outcomes.</p>
<p>That's why I believe that rules of any kind, code or legal, must first of all be malleable, and secondly understandable by everyone concerned by their application (or at least a large enough and open subset of everyone).</p>

<p>I want to provide means for whatever the programmer (or user) is making to be represented in whatever form (e.g. visual or otherwise) is desired, with whatever semantics, and even editor-behaviors. And all the same for the tool itself, as it's its own live-editor.</p>
<p>I'll do this by providing a model (e.g. direct manipulation entities), and having the live code of the tool itself exposed for direct manipulation within that same model, so that anything about it (down to the metal if desired) could be altered (the rendering, the execution model, the data model, etc.).</p>
<p>The point is to bootstrap the incredible power of programming, onto programming itself, with immediate turn around / feedback. And if the initial tool for doing so sucks (e.g. if only I could just drag like this to change that), then change it. If the means for changing how you change that sucks ... well there's no endless tower because it's all live implemented in itself; it's a closed loop.</p>

<p>So much effort goes into making a tool or language, which is repeated over and over ... Can we bootstrap all this work on itself? It's like repeatedly building lever-making-levers by hand. The ignored potential is just painful!</p>
<p>Extend the "power of programming" to the end user; make computers actually be a bicycle for the mind and for interacting with the modern world.</p>
<p>Programming by direct interaction: We want to call this API (click) and take the result (drag), fish out this field (right click), transform it like so (drop it into a function entity, or type an equation) and send the result (click &amp; drag) over to there (drop). And hey look, you can "see the work" (like math homework) and edit it, substitute values, etc. Making the line between programming and using very thin, leads to my next point:</p>
<p>I think this could be a new kind of literacy, and we won't have it until we can bootstrap programming out of source code. How powerful is that smartphone in your hand? What does that even mean if it's inaccessible to you though? All the power of software in your hand, but none of the power of software in your hand. To me, closing that loop / bootstrapping that power, is the computer revolution that hasn't happened yet.</p>

Some people have the sensation of understanding something, but they don't; some don't have it but they do. This already begs the question how do we know that they actually understand the right thing? How can anyone be a judge of that, and I presume the answer is Popper's scientific method — unless otherwise proven false, it's probably true (things can get more complicated than that, but I guess that's the gist of it).

<p>My intention was to point out that while GPT-3 seems "obviously inferior" in its current incarnation, things like that are often said just looking at the technology, but not looking at ourselves. We don't really know how understanding works. And I don't mean the philosophical angle (what understanding is), but the cognitive science perspective.</p>
<p>Our theories about how the brain works have evolved quite a bit, even though there's still lots more left to discover, but I'm not so sure that our cognitive processes are so "obviously superior" to what GTP-3 does. That doesn't mean that I believe we're close to AGI either, I'm just trying to raise awareness that to compare machine capabilities to our own, we can't just look at technology alone, but also need to advance the understanding of ourselves.</p>

Those are rather connected. </p>
<p>Understanding how the brain works more does not necessarily get us to understand how understanding works. Even if it did though, translating from the brains neural circuits with their causal mechanisms to software based syntatic simulation doesn't guarantee there is understanding.</p>
<p>Searle's view is that those neuronal causal firing are necessary. In other words hardware based AI is possible, but not software. Or put anything way, no amount of syntatic manipulation gives you semantics. Of course others disagree. Lots of cognitive scientist/philosophers just don't believe there is anything like understanding at all. </p>
<p>You might not be interested in any of this and that is okay. But I think these crucial if we want to create some ai with actual understanding.</p>

As ever, people are tripping over the fact that "AI" is a tragically poor term for this kind of technology, and are (IMO) wasting a lot of time asking what this means. Rather, what I see in GPT-2/3, and large-scale ML models generally, is an interesting new kind of tool that we have yet to find all the various uses for. It joins an esteemed family of breakthrough enabling technologies like the mouse+GUI, the internet, the GPU, GPS, etc. (though perhaps not quite at that tier). The philosophical implications of it are interesting, but very much in the same way that the philosophical implications of the mouse + GUI, or long-distance communication, are interesting. What is exciting about it is that we now get to collectively discover all the neat new things we can do with it. We're going to find how it is a tool. Maybe we also find how it reflects on our own minds, but as others have said, I think likening one to the other is a category error.</p>
<p>To further what Ian said,</p>
<blockquote><p>it doesn’t have an understanding of anything it’s writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say: Nobody should expect it to have anything that could be described as understanding. It doesn't need to have understanding to be interesting.</p>

<p>“Understanding” means the ability to recognize an object/pattern in multiple dimensions and thus have a subjective representation of the object/pattern ( which works into prediction skills that are needed to survive in the world ) and know it’s relations to it’s context.</p>
<p>GPT-3 is 2.5D, we need nD.</p>
<p>N “models” which constantly self-optimise,minimise and grow under control of 2 agents - internal &amp; external.</p>
<p>But I agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpossibleScott">Scott Anderson</a>, IMO the best way to use it for code generation “is a probalistic search engine”. If someone trained it to write a minor part of the code where “branches” connect, it could be super useful, but we’d still need a different access to writing code. For now, it could be a great autocomplete.</p>

<p>What I consider somewhat separate from that (and put in the cognitive science bucket) is the part where we figure out how the activity of thinking manifests in the brain, things like embodiment, image schemas, metaphorical structuring and their neural modeling, etc.</p>
<p>In a way you made a similar distinction yourself when you say “Understanding how the brain works more does not necessarily get us to understand how understanding works” — I agree and somehow think that is almost the point I was making, albeit you phrased it much better.</p>
<p>And yet of course these are all interdependent, and what I’m trying to point out is that there are lots of technologists who do not look at philosophy or cognitive science (and therefore likely base their thinking probably on outdated and/or folk theories) and still have strong opinions on how close GPT-3 is to AGI or not.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the connection to the rest of your comment and I'm confused about where your assumption that I might not be interested comes from.</p>

<blockquote><p>Can somebody explain to me what “understanding” means? So machines are basically just trained on patterns… how exactly are humans different…?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the question I was originally trying to address. Are humans any different than machines? Can we just continue to make better models and achieve understanding or consciousness or intelligence? Studying the brain doesn't give us answers to those questions.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you are interested in it. It is probably just a bias that I've picked up where many people are against philosophy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess what I was trying to get at is I don't think those views are grounded. The question of even determining if something we created has true understanding, is actually intelligent, or has consciousness is a hard question. In fact, Ned Block calls that the Harder Problem of consciousness.</p>

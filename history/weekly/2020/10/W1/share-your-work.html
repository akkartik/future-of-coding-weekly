It's just paragraphs now? I was thinking about ways to make this work on arbitrarily small spans of text. One idea was to put the layer selection controls in a floating panel that appears above selected text, so of like the controls in Slack that appear above and to the right when you hover over a message. There are some downsides to that approach, though. I'd be curious to hear what pushed you toward paragraph-level granularity, rather than span-level granularity.</p>

<p>My only feedback would be that maybe the colours should default to less drastically different hues, or be less bright, and also maybe default to being a consistent gradient. At the moment it is not obvious from a glance (at the text) which is the most important parts (it is very clear from the left hand diagram)</p>

<p>I want to present you my new project, <a href="https://adacraft.org/"></a><a href="https://adacraft.org/">https://adacraft.org/</a>! Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.</p>
<p>This project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on "easier programming".</p>
<p>Using Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for "non-experts" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!</p>
<p>So far, I have added some AI extensions and a <a href="https://www.croquet.io/"></a><a href="https://www.croquet.io/">https://www.croquet.io/</a> extension. An AI extension that uses <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"></a><a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/</a> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML/DOM, and, why not, √† la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch "constraints".</p>
<p>And of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! üôè ‚ò∫</p>

<p>The rule you want to disable (or set to black) is <code>.blocklyText { fill: #fff }</code>. You might want to disable it for <code>.blocklyDropdownText</code> , too, but you'll get gray instead of black because the dropdown seems to be covered by a dim transparent overlay. Still, making the text black is a big improvement already.</p>

<p>Since Konrad started to talk about it, it sticks in my mind and I can't wait to experiment different layouts...</p>
<p>Maybe, I will play with it on my local env. But before pushing it online, I guess I will try using it for some time. I have to be sure it looks OK.</p>
<p>I guess I also will make the blocks background lighters, if not completely white.</p>
<p>And, maybe, if I can, I will keep the two themes, for those that feel more comfortable with the original one.</p>

There are only 2 issues I've seen; firstly that it takes a lot longer for them to 'prepare' the HD version, and you get low res until it is processed.  Secondly, the first few seconds of viewing are blurred.  As far as I can tell this is just normal behavior.  Thinking about it, I wonder if this is due to me being a premium subscriber (I haven't looked back since turning that on and turning adverts off üòâ</p>

Making a visual system as powerful as possible is a hard problem. To me is sounds like you are trying to make this an entirely visual interface without any symbolic formalism behind it? That would be crazy to pull off! I think it‚Äôs possible to include symbols, but to minimize their use as much as possible and get something both visual and powerful from it. </p>

I love the way in which the changes are propagated throughout the system and there are snapshots of each result on the border. One thing I wanted to ask was whether you have considered making the operations as a first class item in the language, that is, sometime when you are in a remix mode, you might want to move/swap around the operators themselves between the operands of another combination that will yield an unforeseen happenstance combination. I think such a structuring of the system could potentially lead to opening up the space for more creative operations.</p>
<p>I really love the direction and would love to see how this evolves. Great job!</p>

<p>Also, how about decomposition a la projection, that is, you can decompose a bivector into two vectors? (I guess some of these operations would be surjective and you might need to present the user with an option panel on how to decompose).</p>
<p>I think there are so many possibilities in here to experiment and I‚Äôm sure you might have thought about the possibilities through in here better than me. So I think it might also hepl having a focus on a core subset that fulfills the need of content creators who want to build pretty 3D visualization would be a great niche to try this out with. Have you started looking for such an audience for this yet?</p>

<p>You can hear more about my (possibly dumb) reasons for this here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8</a> and, in case you've not seen it, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR-MQm3c13Q"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR-MQm3c13Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR-MQm3c13Q</a>, especially the parts about live coding and programming by diagram.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I have a simulation of all of the many smart people who have, over the years, told me "visualization is good but it has limits". I've already made what feel like concessions üòÖ and my simulation (and the real people...) will say "I told you so" at some point.</p>
<p>I should stop now but I've got some notes on this for a talk at some point.</p>

Just like how you can select some text and then drag and drop it to rearrange the text, if you make + and * a block like the operands, they would be amenable for drag and drop too. Say you drag a + from a certain operation and then drop it to an operation where there is a division and you will get to interactively explore what such things result in.</p>
<p>I recommend such an interaction under the notion that to pan around on the canvas, users might already reach out for their mouse. So letting some tinkering with the mouse available might also be helpful.</p>

They will get a chance to see what the interactions of these elements are like and map that back to the symbol runes they see in their texts.</p>

<p>I implemented support for floating-point in Mu last week. Since then, I've been stress-testing it using this ray-tracing tutorial (hat tip <a href="http://www.chrismaughan.com/">Chris Maughan</a>): <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html"></a><a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html</a>. It's been great; I've found 2 bugs so far.</p>
<p>Today I thought I'd found a third, in the floating-point reciprocal instruction. Except it wasn't really. Here's the story: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/main/x86_approx.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/main/x86_approx.md">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/main/x86_approx.md</a></p>
<p>Comments most appreciated. I'm particularly interested to hear if any points in the story seemed to skip a few steps.</p>

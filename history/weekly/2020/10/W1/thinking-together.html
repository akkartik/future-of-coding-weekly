In Common Lisp, packages are just namespaces. Live coders can modify code everywhere at any time. In Julia, as in Python or in most Schemes, live coding is limited to the "main" namespace (whatever it is called) and code in modules or packages can be modified predictably only by restarting the session.</p>
<p>Caveat: I haven't looked seriously at Julia for more than a year. Maybe there is tooling to work around this by now.</p>

(I fall on the opposite side of this from Matthias Felleisen, as live-coding is my preferred way of interacting with a computer.) Anyway, yeah, one can develop Julia packages in the interactive style, but modifying someone else's package at runtime is not part of the culture.</p>

<p>Why haven‚Äôt we seen a good live programming language for data science? It‚Äôs so ideal for it! Everything from sampling / streaming in data results to keep things live to the fact that data analysts / scientists want to move / iterate at the speed of thought, and most of data science is this type of curiosity driven stumbling around the data-dark</p>
<p>To a large extent, S and R aim to be that language, and always have.</p>
<p>I've taken the following above from a slide in <a href="[https://calcul.math.cnrs.fr/attachments/spip/IMG/pdf/r-history-ecology.pdf](https://calcul.math.cnrs.fr/attachments/spip/IMG/pdf/r-history-ecology.pdf)">History and Ecology of R</a> by Martyn Plummer, 2015:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe wanted users to be able to begin in an &gt; interactive&gt;  &gt; environment &gt; [emph. Sietse], where they did not consciously think of themselves as programming. Then as their needs became clearer and their sophistication increased, they should be able to slide gradually into programming.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>‚Äì John Chambers, Stages in the Evolution of S</p>
<p>This philosophy was later articulated explicitly in Programming With Data (Chambers, 1998) as a kind of mission statement for S:</p>

<p>For example, <code>library(my_package)</code> loads that package's components (functions, objects, etc.) directly into the global/top-level namespace. Python, contrariwise, makes <code>import my_package</code>  create a module object <code>my_package</code>  that contains <code>my_package.glm</code> etc.</p>
<p>Python's tradeoff favours codebase construction: you know the provenance of every name in your namespace, and you won't have namespace collisions. There's even a taboo on writing <code>from my_package import *</code></p>
<p>R's tradeoff, contrariwise, favours interactive development. You load a package because you want to use its functions; and you want those functions ready at hand, which means the global namespace and no prefixes.</p>

I use R the same way I use Julia or any Lisp, hanging off of emacs allowing me to send forms interactively from the buffer, pull up a plot window, and so on. And, for all the warts of the language, if one stays in the TidyVerse it's a fairly agreeable experience.</p>
</div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-09-29T10:43:59.065Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Sietse Brouwer</span> <a href="#2020-09-29T10:43:59.065Z" class="date">2020-09-29 10:43:59</a> <div class="message"><p>Yeah! And the Tidyverse, too, heartily favours interactive usage over programming. Take dplyr, for example: that you can type <code>data.frame(apples=1:5, pears=6:10) %&gt;% mutate(fruit = apples + pears)</code>  to compute <code>z</code>  is a big win for ergonomics. Alternatives like <code>df.fruit = df.apples + df.pears</code>  get real old real fast, in my unfortunately-extensive experience with Pandas. And <code>mutate("fruit = apples + pears")</code>  limits you to whatever operators are allowed in that stringly mini-dsl.</p>
<p>But allowing unquoted names has a tradeoff: it disfavours programming in the tidyverse. What if I'd like to write a function that does the same 'analysis', but is generic over column names?</p>
<pre><code>add_fruit &lt;- function(df, col1, col2, colresult) {

    # usage: addfruit(mydf, "apples", "pears", "fruit")

    df %&gt;% mutate(colresult = col1 + col2

}</code></pre><p>would get me an error saying 'no <code>col1</code> in <code>df</code>', and I'd need to do some contortions to make clear that I want to use the contents of <code>col1</code> as a name, rather than the name <code>col1</code>  itself.</p>
<p>Other languages that make the same tradeoff:</p>
<ul><li>the various shell languages (sh, fish, PowerShell), where bare words are literal, variables are $something, and the meaning of a literal is determined by the invoked command's argument parser. Like R, a language focused on interactive use.</li><li>Tcl, too: first word is a command, later words are command arguments, bare words are taken literally, $something denotes the contents of the 'something' variable. And Tcl, too, is focused on providing an interactive shell over lower libraries -- and even on making such shells easy to create.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-09-29T13:23:13.066Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Konrad Hinsen</span> <a href="#2020-09-29T13:23:13.066Z" class="date">2020-09-29 13:23:13</a> <div class="message"><p><strong>@William Taysom</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher">Jack Rusher</a> One feature of Scheme that is a bit at odds with live coding (and thus the eternally running "system") is continuations. They make sense only in the context of a computation that has an end. A language designed for live-coding would use delimited continuations instead. Scheme implementations thus must treat the top level as something special.</p>

I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation where we are starting to work on a new project [1]: a wiki of functions (name is currently being discussed by the community) [2]. Imagine that for every function, you have on wiki page, where the wiki page describes what the functions does, it's formal parameters (input types, output types), etc. Each function can have several implementations associated with it (which can be built either from other functions in the wiki or be natively written in a programming language, and we plan to support many of those) and also tests. Maybe the best way to understand the project is to take a look at some of the early mockups. [3]</p>
<p>The functions are meant to be functional, i.e. not to rely on state (well, not too much - they are able to call out to the Web, e.g. to look up information in Wikidata, etc., so in some way, the Web does provide state. We will need to figure that part out. There's a lot of open questions around that).</p>
<p>The type system is also in the wiki, so that it is extensible by the community.</p>
<p>We are in very early development (and, in fact, hiring!) [4] I am happy to answer any questions, but I would love to invite folks to join us, either for discussing the  project, help working on it, or ask as hard questions and think about how to solve it. [5]</p>
<p>A preprint paper with background can be found on Arxiv. [6] The paper has been accepted, but not published yet.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions here, and to have discussions about what we are doing. In the future I expect us to have many questions like "what is a good exception system", "do we need a type hierarchy", "what should the UX for the project do", etc., so would love to have a place for that.</p>

As someone who is interested in Machine Learning on Code and focused to documentation, I can see huge value this can bring. But I still am not clear about the term <code>function</code> here. As a professional developer I write and maintain thousands of them regularly. And many of them are very project specific and involves the knowledge of the business rules or domain knowledge. How am I supposed to write them here? I mean they can contain sensitive information in the first place and also they can be pretty obscure for someone with no external knowledge of what problem they are trying to solve. Also, another thing I am not sure that is there some language from which those functions come? (like C, C++, JS, Python etc.) or they are an abstract representation of some of the basic computational concept that each language exposes?

So, we might have, e.g. multiplication, and then an implementation in JavaScript and one in Scala. There can also be implementations which compose other functions. So one implementation of multiplication could be based on using the addition function, for example. If we have an implementation of addition in, say, Python, we can use the composition to execute multiplication in Python too, because if we know how to execute all the pieces multiplication is composed of in a specific programming language, we can also execute the composed result. This will often be less efficient than having a native implementation of multiplication in Python, but it should work.

This is a public site, that anyone can use. This is for the functions that people will share, that people want to put into a public repository, a common library. So the wiki might have a function such as "how to convert a gregorian calendar date to a julian calendar date" but not "how do I apply the coupon code in my internal system". You will be welcome to use functions from the repository in your code, but just as with Wikipedia or Wikidata, not all content makes sense in the global open repository.</p>

<p>OK so.... that was a lie; just to put you in the correct mindset of TRUST NOTHING THAT FOLLOWs.</p>
<p>I would be interested in exploring how "developer tooling" could get better at addressing this. I use that term rather broadly; so would put "type systems" and "interpreters that support dynamic languages" into the bucket of developer tooling.</p>
<p>Design of these tools is the hard part. I'm currently of the hypothesis that highly opinionated tools are great; as long as they restrict users in "the right way"</p>
<p>So one day in fantasy land our tools will tell us where our impure code is. And let us chose our poison in a boilerplate friendly way of how we wish to address testing; probably using different trade offs at different stages of various test cycles.</p>
<p>The "lessons learned" in building type systems is likely a fertile learning ground</p>
<p>The last 15 years in API design lessons relating to "high performance IO" must have some critical insights.</p>
<p>If we can put all those take aways in one box; that might be the starting point for having enough info to build the end-game of effect management.</p>
<p>(I clearly need to work on refining my thinking &amp; communication thereof in this space)</p>

We're not in <strong>#of-functional-programming</strong> , but I'd like to propose a recent functional programming innovation: Algebraic Effects.</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother too much in understanding the name (I don't quite get why it's named that), but the essence is this:</p>
<ul><li>Annotate your function types with the effects they can have. Haskell kind of has this with IO, for example. but IO is this behemoth that can do anything. And you can't get rid of it, once something in your call stack uses it, you have to be IO as well. In contrast, if you use e.g. the <code>State</code> monad, you can resolve it at a higher level by running it, and you'll get back a pure value.</li><li>All the annotated side-effects your functions can generate are accumulated. So a function that needs an effect like <code>readFile : FilePath -&gt; String</code> will be composable with a function that needs an effect like <code>openSocket : () -&gt; SocketId</code> . The resulting expression will contain both effects.</li><li>Finally, all the effects don't actually refer to actual implementations, but rather, they refer to something like datatypes. At any point you can do something similar to what try-catch does to exceptions: You can handle effects. Thus, you can e.g. always return the same (mocked) string for <code>readFile : FilePath -&gt; String</code>. Or you can accumulate all files written with the <code>writeFile : FilePath -&gt; String -&gt; ()</code> effect.</li></ul><p>If you want to learn more about algebraic effects, I recommend looking at <a href="http://unisonweb.org"></a><a href="http://unisonweb.org">http://unisonweb.org</a>. Other than that, there's the typescript-like language koka (microsoft research) and the paper for "Frank", horribly named "Do be do be do".</p>

<p>However, in reality, you can write and read files in haskell, thus, it has side effects.</p>
<blockquote><p>It does annoy me that I can't actively mark something as pure and have it enforced.This is what motivated me to answer you: In haskell, if a function is annotated with <code>IO</code>, including this computation in the <code>main :: IO ()</code> computation will run its side effects. If not, it's pure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like this is exactly fulfills your wish.</p>
<p>However, writing IO functions is not very common in haskell. In fact, you try to write as much pure logic as possible, before your call stack approaches the outermost layer of your application, which is written in IO. I feel like this is one big difference between haskell and python, and it's not about functionality, it's about conventions.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality, there's one big difference between haskell and python: Types. However, if your goal is annotating pure-ness and statically enforcing this, you'll probably need some form of type system (even if only two types exist "has side effect" and "doesn't have side effect").</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't like to write code full of side effects, hard to test, hard to reason about, hard to know all the edge cases. I also don't like mocks and doing dependency injection everywhere to be able to switch the side effect parts is a lot of work.One of my hobby projects is to make a practical programming language that is easy to use, easy to understand, has a low barrier to entry, and has simple semantics. In my language, all functions are pure (function calls do not have side effects), and there is no shared mutable state, because that leads to simpler semantics and less cognitive load. I think my goals are different from functional programming researchers, because there, the focus is on complex type systems. Eg, Haskell is a very complex language with a steep learning curve. Whereas my language is dynamically typed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for "the future of side effects", I think there is a much larger design space for side-effect-free programming languages than what is currently explored by FP researchers focused on higher order type theory.</p>

That seems like an incremental improvement to the current state of things, with backwards compatibility to the old coding style. Side effects are more visible and more controllable, giving at least some of the advantages of using a side effect free language.</p>
<p>I'm not sure Algebraic Effects provides all the advantages of side-effect-free programming. If you've got a big web of shared mutable state, and you call a function that modifies some of that state as a side effect, AE can tell you that there are side effects but I don't see how it helps you understand what state is being modified. In side effect free programming, the connections are explicit, since you can't modify state that isn't passed as an argument.</p>

Functions are pure mathematical functions with no side effects, and they compute a value. Procedures perform an effect, such as an I/O effect.</p>
<p>I don't do logic programming, so correct me if I'm wrong, but in Prolog, you don't have functions. You have facts, rules, predicates, and evaluation is logical deduction. I/O is done using magic I/O predicates that perform I/O as a side effect of deduction. So Prolog models I/O using side effects, even though it doesn't have functions. How does I/O work in your language?</p>

They can be arbitrarily fine-grained, and the calling context has full control over how the effects are expressed (so yes, you can tell what state is modified ;) ). It's semantically very close to returning actions, but with friendlier control flow.</p>

It‚Äôs a big mix of several paradigms.</p>
<p>My own plan for I/O: the state of the program is just a set of deductions. Rules can only make deductions: they have no additional effects. Relations do not have ‚Äúinputs‚Äù and ‚Äúoutputs‚Äù: they are just a set of deductions. How does a program interact with the external world? External agents just look at the program state and execute actions accordingly. If the program wants to flip on a light switch, then it just puts a tuple into its state (‚Äúlight switch‚Äù, ‚Äúon‚Äù) and an external ‚Äúswitch-flipper agent‚Äù  (pre-configured with permission to view a portion of the program state) does the flipping. These agents are managed by the operating system: they aren‚Äôt part of the programming language or its libraries.</p>
<p>External agents can also write tuples to the program‚Äôs state, of course.</p>
<p>I plan to use a model of time that accommodates such interactions and allows a distinction to be made between ‚Äúevents‚Äù (momentary tuples) and ‚Äústate‚Äù (persistent tuples). All I/O must be asynchronous in order to have a clean way to define state transitions (observe event -&gt; deduce new state).</p>

He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue with libraries of hand-optimized functions boils down to our inability to easily build composable building blocks that perform well. Current sparse linear algebra libraries do not let us compose expressions, data structures, optimization strategies, and architectures without sacrificing performance. The first performance loss is from lost temporal locality‚Äîa deficiency that is also present with dense operations. Second, sparse operations may operate on many different data structures, which are each designed to work well on one type of sparsity pattern. If two composed functions do not support the same data structure, then it becomes necessary to perform an expensive conversion between irregular data structures. But the most serious issue is that composing two sparse linear or tensor algebra functions may perform asymptotically worse than a fused function written to compute the entire expression at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think more generally about the composability vs. performance trade-off.  Being able to compose black box abstractions at a high level is at the very foundation of software engineering, enabling programmers to eliminate boilerplate and more easily use others‚Äô work. Yet composition is the enemy of performance: a careful implementation that fuses two operations is often more efficient than a sequenced invocation of the two. However, most compilers today only offer <code>#[inline]</code> pragmas or other extremely shallow means of reducing abstraction/composition costs. Even the most advanced C++ template magic can‚Äôt do the necessary code-reordering to achieve the optimal composition that Fred describes.</p>
<p>Several programming systems have good ideas in this direction:</p>
<ul><li>Zero-cost abstractions in programming languages (eg Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html"></a><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html</a>)</li><li>Separating algorithm from schedule (eg Halide <a href="http://halide-lang.org/"></a><a href="http://halide-lang.org/">http://halide-lang.org/</a>)</li><li>Using higher-order functions to express data parallelism (eg Spark <a href="https://spark.apache.org/"></a><a href="https://spark.apache.org/">https://spark.apache.org/</a>)</li></ul><p>Curious to hear others‚Äô thoughts (how will we manage this trade-off in future langs/compilers?) and pointers to relevant work.</p>

First I'll say that I do like Bret Victor, and a lot of this is inspired by his work. It's clearly an embarrassment that, for a programmer to specify a vector, often all they can do is write eg vec2(2.9,4.4), when clearly that should be specified with the mouse (and a transform/dual quaternion should be specified with a VR controller!). The same is true of a function curve.</p>
<p>However, I agree with the criticism many have of Bret Victor/GRAIL/MaxMSP-style visual programming that they use mouse/drag-and-drop too much. The problem of "choose what the program does" almost always means "scroll to this point in execution, choose a function and some variables, and apply that". That is best done with a keyboard that impacts a carat. The number of variables and functions available to you is large enough that if you try to pick them from a menu, it'll take much longer than typing the name, and you'll be more likely to click the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I've considered having "click on this variable in the display window and its name is pasted at your carat", which is partway towards drag and drop. But I've never felt the need for that while using the system, so I might never implement that!</p>
<p>Indeed for the purpose you describe I was thinking about a toggle-able "just show me the names" mode. It might turn out to be unnecessary though!</p>

Something like what the command xp does in Vim on a single line, but that done on multiline is what I intended to achieve with making operations as first class citizen, that is do x (cut) on an operation and then p (paste) on another operation to swap their places. I think that will lead to more exploratory ideas in the system. But since I haven‚Äôt interacted with what you have built, there‚Äôs a chance that I could be off. But see if what I suggested fits, otherwise its cool. What you have shown so far is amazing. Looking forward to see what you do with it!</p>

<p>Would be interested to know why the term "lens" is more helpful than just a vanilla "transformation" or "migration"</p>
<blockquote><p>A &gt; lens &gt; is a bidirectional transformation between a pair of connected data structures, capable of translating an edit on one structure into an appropriate edit on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it's so momentous that a strict new term is the only thing that suffices</p>
<p>That aside, looks like great work</p>

<p>I've found, as you mentioned, it's necessary to be able to lookup data, either via objects within the same payload, or making another request, in order to apply the transformation. And to be able to reverse the transformation, it's necessary to have stored information (mostly object ids) from the initial transformation.</p>
<p>Also, with each transfer I've found it necessary to augment the data with some assumed information on each transformation, and I'm not sure it's possible to reverse without some dataloss. I'm also not sure I can reverse the changes with a single "lens" as some transformations aren't reversible.</p>
<p>Not sure if that's useful, but regardless of whether it's possible to do with or without dataloss, I think this research is great and will be a big step forward to in integrating services. I look forward to seeing where this goes!</p>

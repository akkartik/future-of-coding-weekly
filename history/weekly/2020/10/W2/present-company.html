Before they came to power and built up a propaganda machine, the Nazis gained influence by a combination of disinformation and physical violence that othered Jewish people. So free speech can in fact be used for othering.</p>
<p>I used to think Germany was being silly and fighting the last war by still banning anyone from articulating Nazi belief systems in public, down to the present day. But then I saw the effect that Radio Rwanda had on the genocide there, and that gave me pause. Germany has been closer to the abyss than the rest of us. We should assume they know something we don't.</p>
<p>The internet has given people new capabilities, and that is always accompanied by social turmoil as we figure out how to change the rules to find a new equilibrium. But clinging to "free speech" is just as reactionary as the side you're opposing. It's been shown up to be an ill-posed idea. Large parts of the phase space it encompasses are still valuable, but we need a new framework for pinning down the boundaries of the desirable space.</p>
<p>My current best-guess framing for the world we find ourselves in is to carve out exceptions to free speech when they incite violence. But there's still a lot of leaks to plug in that seam of the world.</p>

To my knowledge speech is free precisely because it is held to not cause harm. Radio Rwanda's broadcasts would not have run afoul of Brandenburg (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations</a>)</p>

<p>Above all, it's not clear to me that people have ever agreed on the lines circumscribing free speech.</p>
<blockquote><p>Self-censoring and fear of speaking out due to fear of the consequences (from social shaming all the way to being beaten) is currently an everyday reality. Not the world I grew up in, and miss so much.Again, citation required. I think the reputational consequences of speech have always been around, and we have all always grown up watching what we say. The expectation to speak without consequence is usually comorbid with some level of privilege. What has changed in recent times (and this is the "new capability" I alluded to above) is that it's become easy to cast your voice far and wide. That makes it easy to cast your words farther than you want. It's not a difference in kind, merely one of degree. Like needing to unlearn some skills when switching from tennis to racketball.</p>

I find it interesting, but I'm opting to not participate because my political views are incendiary (or at least I like to think they are, haha). As a non-American, I'm with you that it would be nice to see more discussion of non-American politics, especially as it pertains to FoC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn</a> comes to mind). But I view that as an "in addition to", not an "instead of" this sort of discussion.</p>
<p>It's good that you voiced your concern about the discussion. I'll take all the feedback I can get â€” just because I feel "fine" with it doesn't mean it's good for the health of the community. If you'd like to talk about it more, send me a DM or feel free to spin up a new discussion in <strong>#administrivia</strong>.</p>

This is a powerhouse of bad things and Future of Coding does not only mean Technological or Design advances in computer science but it also means ethically better computing. Don't you agree?

<p>Let's split this into a few pieces.</p>
<ul><li>The American vs non stuff is mostly in reference to Kartik's first post and Nick's post, not the rest of the thread.</li></ul><ul><li>The question of relevance to FoC is mostly a matter of framing. We could have an FoC-oriented discussion on the subject (or, really, any subject). But you began this thread with "Not directly FoC but I guess highly important", which isn't much of a prompt for any particular kind of discussion. If you'd like to point the conversation in a new direction, by all means go for it. Tell us a little more of what you think about the ideas in article.</li></ul></div> <div class="attachments"></div> <div class="files"></div></div><div id="2020-10-11T19:11:58.065Z" class="reply"><span class="user">Kartik Agaram</span> <a href="#2020-10-11T19:11:58.065Z" class="date">2020-10-11 19:11:58</a> <div class="message"><p><a href="https://github.com/rcshubhadeep">Shubhadeep Roychowdhury</a> It's not clear to me what you're objecting to.

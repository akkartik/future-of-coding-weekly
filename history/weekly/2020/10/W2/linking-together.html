The exact same problem has been around for decades concerning the use of math in science and engineering. An example from physics education is the old but ongoing debate on how to teach quantum mechanics: in terms of concrete representations (wave functions) or in terms of abstract representations in Hilbert spaces. It really depends on the prior knowledge/experience of the students, and that's something a teacher can't even know before the start of the course.</p>
<p>So I think that programming and its teaching can learn a lot from maths in this respect.</p>

If you see my current <strong>#two-minute-week</strong> post, I'm working on doing most of this stuff in my own editor; that's one end goal for me.</p>
<p>I intend for my editor (<a href="https://github.com/Rezonality/zep"></a><a href="https://github.com/Rezonality/zep">https://github.com/Rezonality/zep</a>) to handle the Markdown editing/linking/jumping stuff.  I think that's an easier task.</p>
<p>I imagined that for the web deploy I would have a CSS file and some off the shelf markdown convertor.  Something basic at first - and yes, to github pages.</p>
<p>I got around to trying Obsidian's slide support; it is nicely done and so simple.  I don't see why I couldn't do something similar.</p>

He couldn‚Äôt run the same programs on his desktop computer, he said with some irritation, so the Dell was here to stay. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last one that will support QuickBASIC, which is kind of a shame, because it‚Äôs the only language I really know.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote><p>I asked him if I could put his code on GitHub, and he asked me what GitHub was. In lieu of that, he handed me printouts of his computer programs, three stacks of paper that had been neatly stapled at the corners. The one on the top, he apologized, had several dependencies that he hadn‚Äôt had the time to print out. Long before he became the judge presiding over Silicon Valley, Alsup had been a hobbyist operating in isolation; he‚Äôs a geek, but he‚Äôs a geek from another era.</p>

As someone who has always had trouble ‚Äúlining up‚Äù equations from books and papers with software implementations, having symbols like this would make it slightly less painful to verify the correctness of an implementation (assuming you understand what a particular symbol means in the context of your domain model). However, this might also be useful for folks who have to read code from domains with which they are unfamiliar. In that context, an interesting language feature might be to allow the use of stylized single-character names, with the caveat that you can only use them as ‚Äúaliases‚Äù for existing names (I‚Äôm imagining <a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl/issues/537#issuecomment-439863841"></a><a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl/issues/537#issuecomment-439863841">https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl/issues/537#issuecomment-439863841</a> but with the ability to hover over all the identifiers and see their definition: what does ‚Ñ≥ π mean, for example, or Œõ‚ÇÇ?). Perhaps you could also import ‚Äúcommonly-used‚Äù symbol definitions from a particular field: for instance <code>import quantum-mechanics</code> might include h (Planck‚Äôs constant), and Œ® (representing a wave function), and so on...</p>

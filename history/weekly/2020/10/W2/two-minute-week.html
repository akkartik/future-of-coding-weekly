<p>I need closure because I've gotten excited recently about dropping my dependency on the Linux kernel, and a way to provide graphics without an OS.</p>
<p>Using BIOS.</p>
<p>waves hands. No, wait, come back. Check this out: <a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532"></a><a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532</a>. While using *VGA primitives is never going to give a large screen resolution or 60fps games, I think it might give us some nice new capabilities for very little code.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think of the BIOS as "a standard instruction set for all the other hardware besides the processor." That seems fruitful.

<p>The real problem down this road is input. A keyboard will be fine. A mouse seems iffy but hopefully doable. But pressure-sensitive multi-touch, fuggedaboudit. So no minority-report-style FoC demos in Mu's future. Oh well. I'm not even sure what a reasonable API for multi-touch looks like, so I'm not going to worry about it for now.</p>

A week later I realized that a lot of BIOS only works in 16-bit mode. And I'm not willing to give up 32-bit mode. There's other hobbyist computers out there that do 8-bit and 16-bit, and part of the hypothesis of Mu is that we're still carrying the baggage of extreme optimization-focus in our computing stacks, and that our computers might be more comprehensible if computers in the 80s had more RAM. Dropping down to 16-bit would give up easy access to most RAM and nudge me like many others along a path of trying to squeeze code into fewer bytes. So -- particularly for network drivers -- it seems there's no way around some sort of OS with device drivers. So I'm kinda bummed out about this trail for now. The computing industry is busted in ways I'm not really empowered to fix. Perhaps I'll pick it up again in a few months and try to come up with some lowest-common-denominator set of hardware standards that all devices support. *VGA for screen, PS/2 for keyboard/mouse, there's something called the "em driver" for ethernet that's supposed to be widely supported, but I need to dig into it.</p>

<p>This is something I've wondered about a lot. But mostly from the other side ‚Äî what might future programmers (and, usually when I think this, I'm picturing games programmers specifically) discard of our current best efforts, since their better hardware affords them a purer conception that we couldn't access (or sell).</p>

The funny thing is that I haven't build that form-designer yetüòÄ.  But thanks for sharing those details about max-msp and pure/data, I am going to look at that (because I haven't so farüòä)</p>

Though the distinction with "just visualization" is kinda moot when there are no side effects. Evaluation is a tiny part of visualization here, and evaluation often happens over and over again for a single rendering of the screen. Either way, there's no way for a function to access the (caller's) stack below the args it declares.</p>

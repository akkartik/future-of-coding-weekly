<p>I'm quite happy with how this is turning out. The environment is visual but dense. I imagine the ability to juggle multiple sandboxes on the right, all sharing a common set of function definitions on the left. Functions still can't be edited, but the mechanisms for editing are in place, and you'll be able to see all sandboxes update as you edit function definitions.</p>
<p>The one major drawback -- that <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion">Ivan Reese</a> won't like -- is the extensive use of name-punning to make this work. By construction, function definitions share the same names for their arguments as the ones you chose for their first call. As a result you almost immediately have two <code>x</code>s on the same line that look the same and seem to behave identically, but mean subtly different things.</p>

The UI geek in me wants to move the text to align with the stack - like this:</p>
<p>Is that something that is hard to do in the terminal?</p>

<p>I've spent the last few weeks fixing the build system to use vcpkg (this is a massive change, but a massive improvement too; it should really reduce the time I waste making builds work.&nbsp;It also makes my CMake files smaller and simpler).  I estimate I spend 25% of my time fixing cross platform builds/CI. etc.  This has to stop; I have lost weeks to figuring out all these issues.  Discovering that vcpkg solves most of my problems was a revelation; it is laughably easy to build complex libraries and link them into your projects.</p>
<p>I've also been updating to the ImGui docking branch.&nbsp;This is going to be great for live coding; giving you more surface area to put your various windows and tools.&nbsp;This screenshot is an example across my 3 monitors; I will shortly have the visual pieces up and running too.</p>

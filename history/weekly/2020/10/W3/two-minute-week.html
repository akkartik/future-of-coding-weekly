<p>also (tricky question): any thoughts on recursion?</p>

But my thought is that arg order should match calls. The function definition <code>x y myFunc</code> should map to a call like <code>3 4 myFunc</code> with <code>x</code> getting <code>3</code> and <code>y</code> getting <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't think there's anything tricky about recursion! A recursive call is just a function call like any other, and the visualization metaphor here should uncoil it just like any other call. I don't have conditionals or quotes yet, so all recursion at the moment would be infinite. So it's not very useful at the moment.</p>

Different parts of a single (expanded) line may have very different behavior attached to the same name (here <code>x</code>).</p>

<p>not sure what i thought would be tricky about recursion‚Äîjust can be tricky in general for UI</p>
<p>i wonder if the name-punning issue can be resolved a bit further in UX. may have some messy sketch ideas about that</p>

I don't know if that's a valid argument, though..</p>

FORTH avoids name punning by not naming the args in anything other than comments and just assuming there is a thing on the stack and my operation does this to it. That said, you can't do arg checking or any sort of typing in that manner.</p>

It would have to be purely positional which would be very hard to read for humans.</p>

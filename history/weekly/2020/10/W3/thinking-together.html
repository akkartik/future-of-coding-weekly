Where your cursor + attention is about to go is always clear and we've invented lots of ways to accelerate getting your cursor to where you want it to go. How does that play out in things that aren't text though, like all the flow based languages we're seeing, or tools like Webflow that are trying to make it fast to create trees of stuff? Are we destined for slower mouse based interfaces that don't leverage muscle memory as much?</p>

<blockquote><p> Whereas vi‚Äôs keystroke language follows&nbsp;&gt; verb-object&gt; &nbsp;order, Kakoune inverts that by following&nbsp;&gt; object-verb&gt; &nbsp;order. In real terms, that means you make a selection (object) before deciding what to do (verb) with it. The object might be a character, word, sentence, paragraph, parenthetical, regular expression, you name it; the verb might be&nbsp;&gt; delete&gt; ,&nbsp;&gt; yank&gt; &nbsp;(copy),&nbsp;&gt; change&gt; ,&nbsp;&gt; indent&gt; , or even transformative operations like&nbsp;&gt; lint&gt; ,&nbsp;&gt; format&gt; ,&nbsp;&gt; uppercase&gt; , etc. In Kakoune, it is with this reversed grammar, this postfix notation, that you interactively sweep up a group or groups of characters before acting on them. That way if your object isn‚Äôt quite right, you can immediately correct it without having to undo and redo your verb.</p>

In general navigation seems to be the trickiest bit of making an application keyboard centric. On the keyboard the basic movement is really only (up, down, left, right) and if the layout makes it unclear where those directions will take you it‚Äôs hard to make it feel really good/be usable. Fixed layout ui‚Äôs can get away with some navigation that doesn‚Äôt make as much sense since the user can gain familiarity.</p>
<p>Fluid layouts like a flowchart editor inherently dont have natural up/down/left/right navigation that will be quick and intuitive. I think the interaction model of jumping around to the nodes and edges of the flowchart is just not well suited to the keyboard as an input device. </p>
<p>For flowcharts + keyboard maybe the right approach is going with the ‚Äògrain‚Äô of the keyboard and build a really good graphviz (or graphviz like language) editor with augmented text as the primary interaction mode. And then have mouse manipulation as a secondary interaction for smaller layout tweaks. That way you could assemble graphs as fast as you can type. Another route would be to build on a different input device better suited to the task of flowchart construction like ipad</p>

<p>Regarding your stack problem, I'm wondering if you could write some helper subroutines to manage the stack?  A call to store the contents of the A register on the stack, for example, and one to retrieve it.  You could store a stack count and inc/dec it.  At the least you could error when you pop too far off the stack, etc.</p>

Macro assemblers allowed you to write and use macros such as IF, SWITCH, FOR, WHILE, PROC, CALL. Expression-oriented assemblers allowed you to write more than one arithmetic opcode on the same line, using a syntax similar to arithmetic expressions. Try googling "macro assembler" or "high level assembler". Consider adding macros or high level features to the uCISC assembler.</p>

I recently ended up with a method that eats 1 position off the stack somewhere, but the function works perfectly if you don‚Äôt count the side effects.

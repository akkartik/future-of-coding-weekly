</div> <div class="attachments"><blockquote><p>[November 25th, 2020 6:54 PM] ak: An old thread I wish I could link to:</p>
<p>&amp;gt; Consider the powerful, time-honored environment that gives us many ‚Äúsmall programs, each doing one thing well‚Äù, the Unix shell. There is a <code>cut</code> command, a <code>sort</code> command, and many more. A versatile collection of blocks that I can snap together in different ways (yay pipes!). There isn‚Äôt much duplication of commands and the environment seems to have nice composition properties.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; But it only goes so far.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; If I write a program in Unix using Java or Python, can I reuse the Unix <code>sort</code> to sort an array of items inside my program? Of course not, what an improper question! The decent choice is to reimplement sorting in my program (or use the standard library where someone else has already re-implemented it).
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; <em>The computer already knows how to sort things, why do I need to tell it again?</em>
-- &lt;@U8A5MS6R1&gt; (<a href="https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/on-composition.html">https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/on-composition.html</a>)</p>
<p>From the inventor of shells:</p>
<p>&amp;gt; I felt that commands should be usable as library subroutines, or vice versa. This stemmed from my practice of writing CTSS [OS] commands in MAD, a simplified Algol-like language. It was much faster and the code was more maintainable than IBM 7094 assembly code. Since I needed MAD-friendly subroutine calls to access CTSS primitives, I wrote in assembly code a battery of interface subroutines, which very often mimicked CTSS basic command functions. I felt it was an awkward duplication of effort. However, I did not go further in the context of CTSS.

As those analog systems were rebuilt in the computer, it was somewhat natural to replicate the interface.</p>
<p>Don't know why sheet-based programming didn't similarly take off, but perhaps because there wasn't as much usage of sheet-based physical interfaces for electric systems in industry.</p>

It makes a number of really good observations as well as some I disagree with.</p>
<blockquote><p>The designers of the Phelps farm tractor in 1901 based their interface on a metaphor with the interface for the familiar horse: farmers used reins to control the tractor. The tractor was steered by pulling on the appropriate rein, both reins were loosened to go forward and pulled back to stop, and pulling back harder on the reins caused the tractor to back up [5]. It's clear in hindsight that this was a dead end, and automobiles have developed their own user interfaces without metaphors based on earlier technologies. &gt; Nonetheless, people today are designing information-retrieval interfaces based on metaphors with books, even though young folks spend more time flipping television channels and playing video games than they do turning the pages of books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think one of the genuine schisms in FoC work at the moment is whether you lean in to physicality of interactions or not. Bret Victor clearly believes that is the right direction (he's gone off the deep end a bit IMO with Dynamicland). Other people (like this article) point out the limitations of this approach. The General Magic UI with the virtual corridor is clearly nonsense, whereas Victor advocates very convincingly for physical corridors (workshops) you should move through. How come those aren't even more ridiculous?</p>
<p>My initial thoughts are that Victor is right in that there is enormous value in anchoring HCI into the full facets of being human, and the more these align with our deep, long-evolved, senses, the more effective they will be. However, I also believe that human have the ability to fully and completely conceive of some "superpowers" that violate the laws of physics but still obey internal human brain logic. Things like teleportation, x-ray/omniscience, single-timeline time travel. A fully physical system like Dynamicland will struggle to implement things like sorting of files, even though this process introduces no conceptual difficulties.</p>
<p>This quote from the article;</p>
<blockquote><p>Metaphors not only constrain and mislead users, they can also limit designers' ability to invent more powerful interface mechanisms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree with. For example, the file/folder metaphor does not constrain and mislead users, I think it empowers users because it allows them to make use of their intuitions. When you introduce "more powerful interface mechanism" such as symlinks/junction points, at that point you are actually constraining and misleading users, because you are removing the structural support of their intuitions, which ends up with users deleting files in one "place" and them disappearing from another "place" - a clear violation of natural laws.</p>
<p>I think the crux of the disagreement is highlighted by this point;</p>
<blockquote><p>The desktop metaphor assumes we save training time by taking advantage of the time that users have already invested in learning to operate the traditional office with its paper documents and filing cabinets. But the next generation of users will make their learning investments with computers, and it is counterproductive to give them interfaces based on awkward imitations of obsolete technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what extent are these capabilities arbitrary familiarity with now-defunct technology, and to what extent are they absolutely intrinsic and unavoidable aspects of being human?</p>

<p>As far as screens go I think Bret Victor‚Äôs arguments in Magic Ink are still very strong and not being taken seriously be UI designers. (In short that interaction is to be avoided because it‚Äôs faster to ‚Äúnavigate‚Äù with the eye)</p>

<blockquote><p>There's [...] a bidirectional mapping between the textual representation of a function in Ballerina syntax and the visual representation of the function as a sequence diagram.

</blockquote>
<p>The closest analogy I can think of is Visual Basic. The visual model of a UI as a form is integrated with the language semantic to make writing a Windows GUI application much easier than before. Ballerina is trying to do something similar but for a different domain. You could think of it as Visual Basic for the Cloud.</p>

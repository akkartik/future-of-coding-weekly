<p>After pushing hard on development during the summer, we are now again balancing between developing the compiler/language and on the other hand building a community, getting first testers, contributors, so getting some exposure on Product Hunt helps with this.</p>
<p>We are done with "launching" Alpha for now, but we do plan to continue reaching out to people by writing hopefully relevant/valuable blog posts.</p>

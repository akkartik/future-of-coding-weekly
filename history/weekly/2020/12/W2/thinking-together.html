And I mean they're truly just functions: all of the operations upon them are just operations upon functions, and thus they might be repurposed for other uses as well. Javascript and Lua kind of do this, except their philosophy is more like "all collections are just dictionaries", where a dictionary is a heavily-restricted class of function.</p>
<p>This approach ("all collections are just functions") seems like a versatile foundation (especially in the context of the semantics of the programming language I'm working on), so I've been digging into the ramifications of it lately. My biggest challenge so far is figuring out how to identify for which functions operations like set union and intersection are computable. Depending on how the function is constructed/defined, it seems like it could be quite hard to figure out a static "safety check". I want these operations to be well-defined even on recursively-defined functions, so it's not as simple as "ensure the function definition is just a finite list of cases" (i.e, a dictionary).</p>
<p>This doesn't seem unreasonable: Datalog works this way. Datalog predicates are recursively-defined functions from X ‚Üí Bool (i.e. sets) that obey certain constraints so that queries upon them are answerable.</p>

If on the one hand a hash table is a bunch of key, value pairs and, on the other, a standard lambda takes anything and uses it to come up with something else, you can imagine a pattern as living somewhere between: takes some things and uses them to come up with a value.  Given two patterns you can glue them together.  The standard way is that if the first one matches you take it, otherwise check the second one.</p>

Is there something that patterns are better than functions at expressing? One can already compose functions in many different ways.</p>

Patterns here basically amount to partial functions.  So if your domain happens to be all about partial functions (that's me sometimes where I end up using a lot of tables), then there's something to find here.  But it's not going to be anything more than having a few functions for nicely composing <code>a -&gt; Maybe b</code>, generally.</p>
<p>I guess a potential important difference can be whether you want to model order.  For instance, Rubyist that I am, the keys in a <code>Hash</code> are ordered and I use this all the time.  In another context, you may not want to keep that information around.</p>
<p>Another thought that I had while trying to remember the pattern calculus is why prefer a composition operator like this</p>
<pre><code>&lt;+&gt; :: (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b)

(f &lt;+&gt; g) x = f x `orElse` g x</code></pre><p>over something that collects all the results:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;*&gt; :: (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; (a -&gt; [b])

(f &lt;*&gt; g) x = f x ++ g x</code></pre><p>And so on.</p>

The main challenge is dealing with async. Network data fetch is inherently async, but user expect the UI to be sync. Binding async state to UI is a open challenge still being addressed by UI framework like React. While render-as-you-fetch (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html"></a><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html">https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html</a>) looks promising, but React did not ship with concurrent mode yet for many good reasons. Another challenge is efficient data caching &amp; batching. With manual I/O, developer is manually tweaking the I/O operations. Binding async expression to UI, force the developer to rely on the framework to do the right thing. It is possible to auto-optimize in many cases, but it will require the developers to "let go" some control. It requires significant trust between you and the developers using your stuff to write software.</p>

<blockquote><p>During Larry's time in Xerox PARC there really wasn't such a thing as personal computers. At the time, software interfaces were designed around modes. In a text editor you couldn't just start typing and have words appear on the screen.. Larry pioneered the concept of software user studies, and found that many people would fail to get comfortable with the computer even after many weeks of use. And he believed that these modes were to blame, and they represented a threat to the dream of what personal computing could be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Larry made it his personal mission to eliminate modes from software. And he formed a principle. No person should ever be trapped in a mode. His slogan that he'd go around saying is, "don't mode me in." And his website is called: &gt; <a href="http://nomodes.com"></a><a href="http://nomodes.com">http://nomodes.com</a>&gt; .</p>
<p>-- Bret Victor, 2012 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII</a>)</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this a lot for a few weeks as I take my first hesitant steps into UI design and find myself immediately creating modal dialogs. What are people's opinions on the priority of modelessness relative to the other considerations we often discuss here? For example, my UI tries to follow a couple of other principles Bret Victor likes. It minimizes interaction and always shows the complete state at a glance (<a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk"></a><a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk</a>), and it tries to reduce the need for the human to "play computer". Following Christopher Alexander, it tries to keep the display fairly stable and slow-changing. But. It has modal dialogs. 3 so far and counting. Once you bring one up, it's like a database transaction and you have to either commit or roll back.</p>
<p>My current thinking: it's ok if the time spent in a mode is short. A word seems short. It's not a huge hardship if you have to retype a word. Most of the time, words you type appear on screen. But I also notice that browsers used to bring up modal dialogs for say searching for a word on a page, and now they do so in a non-modal way where the panel pops up above or below the page while allowing you to interact with the page. I'm in text mode, so there's a fundamental limitation of only ever being able to interact where the cursor is. Perhaps that's the fundamental 'modefulness' here? I'm curious to hear what others think, and what stories people have about their experiences trying to avoid modes.</p>

<ul><li><p>Make it obvious what mode is active.</p>
</li><li><p>Perfect undo/redo everywhere.</p>
</li><li><p>Add all the things to history. In Vim for example, you can start typing a command at the <code>:</code> prompt, change your mind, hit <code>Esc</code> and go back to other things, hit <code>:</code> and hit up-arrow -- and find the command you typed in but never ran.</p>
</li></ul><p>You're right that modal dialogs aren't exactly the same thing as Vim's modes. I'd actually not connected the two until Bret Victor mentioned Vim above. It might have been some creative license, since Larry Tesler's work seems to mostly predate Bill Joy's creation of vi. So <a href="https://twitter.com/harrybrundage">Harry Brundage</a>'s over-arching framework of "how restrictive is your UI?" seems useful.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrybrundage">Harry Brundage</a> While you're right that I don't usually think of autocomplete as a mode, I have little skirmishes with autocomplete in various apps on a near-daily basis, where the app gets in my way and I have to backspace out of what it 'helpfully' completed. So it does seem useful to think of it as a modal interface, because the errors happen when I'm not conscious of what mode I've suddenly gotten put into. Particularly in combination with overly sensitive multi-touch or palms accidentally touching the trackpad, patterns that have sadly gotten all too common. To me, "never autocomplete" feels like a useful corollary to "don't mode me in" that also overlaps with Christopher Alexander's principles of giving UIs a sense of stability.</p>
<p>I was nodding along when you said, minimize restrictions. However, I think Vim has way too many modes: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor/Vim/Modes"></a><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor/Vim/Modes">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor/Vim/Modes</a></p>

<p>Totally. I never experience this with Vim anymore, because while there are lots of modes the transitions are well-defined and the rules don't keep changing over time. So while I take seriously when people say it's hard to learn, yeah, it doesn't affect me.</p>
<p>Stable opt-in transitions does feel like a good principle to add to the list.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs complicated, but kind of, because religion is primarily about explaining the spiritual. Religion sometimes explains the material (though most frequently when the material is inexplicable), like the creation of the Earth, and stuff. It also occasionally focuses on the logical‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But religion is primarily there to explain that which is immaterial ‚Äî the connection between this and that. The connection between your soul and your body, between a mother and a child, between our past self and our future self, between love and creation, etc.</p>
<p>Most of what religion tries to discuss can‚Äôt be easily reasoned about, or represented symbolically. It is mostly felt or experienced. Hence, religion can‚Äôt be put into print. Sure, stories can, traditions can, beliefs can. But the stories, traditions, and beliefs aren‚Äôt the religion. They‚Äôre merely pointers, trying to reference different aspects of the religion, which is not itself something that can be put into words.</p>
<p>As an increasing amount of our thought was offloaded from feelings to textual analysis, we started thinking like readers. And readers think in a different way from non-readers. Just like speakers think in a different way from non-speakers (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_silence"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_silence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_silence</a>)</p>

<p>Documents provide a single-hop link, and it is the reader's job to keep jumping through links until finding all the pieces needed.</p>
<p>DITA is a document format that encourages reuse of document snippets. I think reuse is good in moderation but as much as I'd love each document to be as self-contained as possible, repetition generates extra work for the reader of skipping known pieces (imagine a book where each chapter had 50% repeated paragraphs...). If repetition is involved, it would be nice to track which snippets I've already seen, and possible hide them.</p>
<p>In general, I'd rather authors provided a trail of links (so the extra hops along documents) to cut the search space. It would also be nice to have better "memory" of the places I visited. Currently browsers simply change the color of visited links, but I'd love to know which "trails" that link belonged to, how long ago I visited, etc.</p>
<p>In short, I'd like the experience of navigating hypertext to feel like I have a mentor next to me pointing me to relevant places, encouraging me to not worry about the sea of irrelevant information, etc.</p>

<p>An author could draw a map spanning more than a single "hop" to the next document.</p>

<ul><li>It's not clear how to scale this UI along several dimensions. What should happen when a line gets too long for the screen? What should happen as values on the stack get wide? Or deep? My screen objects (<a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1605244930088000"></a><a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1605244930088000">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R/p1605244930088000</a>) explored multi-line values on the stack, but it feels wasteful to repeatedly show screens, especially as the screen sizes grow larger and more realistic/useful.</li></ul><ul><li>Many attempts to add capabilities hit the scaling limits even faster. If I try to reimplement shell utilities like <code>grep</code> I need to support files with at least 50-character lines. Requesting URLs on the internet also requires showing long URL strings on the stack.</li></ul><ul><li>One thing I keep rubbing up against is the distinction between editing a program and browsing its state. Bret Victor's demos like <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a> consistently gloss over this. Yes, it's nice to be able to play what-if experiments with your program, but you quickly realize you need to unwind one experiment to try out another. Either you need smart undo, with the ability to somehow drop milestones into the timeline after the fact. Or you need to somehow separate browsing operations from manipulations of the program itself. It feels more feasible to show many copies of a screen object if most of them stay collapsed. Or to truncate URLs if they can be expanded on demand.</li></ul><p>I do have one more idea for an interesting demo: supporting APL-like array operations. But I'm not sure if I should go down that road if there are potentially fatal problems with this whole approach.</p>
<p>A Mu-specific constraint here is the lack of a mouse. My UI has a single point on the screen where I can manipulate things. There's no mouse, because mouse support in text-mode terminals is non-standard and requires understanding differences between terminals. Which requires dependencies beyond a Linux kernel. That's something I've managed to sidestep so far by staying extremely lowest-common-denominator in terminal capabilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll switch gears and focus on getting off the Linux kernel. Then I won't need to worry about terminal compatibilities. But then people would be required to use Qemu to play with Mu. Which sucks üòï Perhaps that's the fundamental psychological block here: I want to keep Mu easy to try out, but beyond a point I can't undo bad historical decisions without adding some friction to checking it out. Then again, it's not like many people try it out anyway, and requiring Linux is just as much friction for someone on a Mac. Yeah, perhaps there's more OS hacking in my future. Thoughts/suggestions appreciated on this angle as well.</p>

<p>What about awkward values on the stackI think you'll have to just put a marker on the timeline stacks (like [$1]), then on the left of the screen show [$1]["<a href="http://example.com/blah/122512"></a><a href="http://example.com/blah/122512">http://example.com/blah/122512</a>"] with the same colouring.

<p>truncation is tricky and my temptation would be to truncate with a reasonable default but make the default accessible. visual stuff like this also benefits from examples. if i were to put my rebol hat on my suspicion would be that long data is often secretly structured in one of two ways: you‚Äôre using data to represent a lot of small differences, like with hash ids, and all you need is displaying something like a scannable difference, or it‚Äôs deeply structured and made linearized (like urls) and you actually want a struct and to display relevant differences based on some context (in a web app you might care if something belongs to a person or a team, or you might just be interested in document ids)</p>
<p>if you‚Äôre just worried about unix compatibility, it might be helpful to investigate the goals: do you want to keep the ui the same? or do you want to have code for unix work on your platform? or do you just want equivalent functionality?</p>

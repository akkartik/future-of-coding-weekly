<div id="2020-12-20T19:10:24.130Z" class="post"><span class="user">Emmanuel Oga</span> <a href="#2020-12-20T19:10:24.130Z" class="date">2020-12-20 19:10:24</a> <div class="message"><p>I'm looking for a format to add a bit of semantic meaning to JSON (as minimal as possible).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit"></a><a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit">https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit</a> is such a format, but I'd like to know if there are others.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine trying to represent JSON+Dates, and no other additional type.</p>
<p>From: <code>["a", 123, ..., "whatever", "~#date:1929292929"]</code> ...</p>
<p>... a JS decoder would see <code>"~#date:1929292929"</code> and convert that to <code>["a", 123, ..., "whatever", new Date(1929292929)]</code> .</p>
<p>What if I wanted to encode the <code>"~#date:1929292929"</code> string verbatim? Now I have to come up with some escaping mechanism, say, <code>~~</code> : <code>"~~~#date:1929292929"</code> , etc.</p>
<p>So I could try to come up with a format to do what I need, but I wonder if there are already specs out there doing something similar other than transit.</p>
<p>I want something a bit easier to implement than Transit... it has a bit more features than I need (for instance, I don't really need caching or user defined types).</p>

There might? be a standard, but don't worth about it. If there is and you find it later, converting whatever you write to their standard should be solvable with a short python program</p>

So yeah, what <strong>@Tyler Adams</strong> said.</p>

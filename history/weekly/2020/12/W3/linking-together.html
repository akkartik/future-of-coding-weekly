I think at some point such an attempt existed (I know of only this one) But basically its very hard to setup a education structure to support thinking in ways Alan proposes. Because society will only (easily) give structures of education to sustain the current type of society. So its really a curious case that Xerox happened. Alan is giving talk over and over how they did  it at Xerox park but there is always a meta frame or perspective missing so I doubt that something like it will be recreated by efforts of allen., I think it could/will be rediscovered by accident but its rather unlikely</p>

Sam Altman / YC president at the time helped them transition out of SAP and into YCR, but ultimately left to run OpenAI. Sam’s openly said that he has a mental model for how to fund things that eventually can be commercialized (even if its a long ways down the road) but no idea how to fund things that can likely never be commercialized.</p>

<p>MSR and Google Research do some interesting work for sure, but I do feel that a lot of it is still specced out. E.g. its hard to research non-neural-network / non-deep-learning models if you’re doing AI research at either place (I’ve heard).</p>

Because for me it is simply about human motivation, curiosity, the desire to understand. Had the people who invented the wheel thought about commercialization? Or great medieval thinkers? Many people are so fond of capitalism that they  are  blinded by their own confirmation bias - only to look what confirms them - instead of looking how the capitalist mindset actually  gives rise to many problems. Many people have written about the problematic relationship between science and empire/capitalism. I like Bertrand Russels Icarus or Dijkstras Diaries (Computer Science/Academia vs Computer Industry). To me it almost seems like without conscious cultural creation its very hard to get anywhere. But culture/society is so vast that change from bottom up becomes almost impossible. Its a hard problem But working with peoples motivation and new kind of organisational structures could provide new insights.</p>

It talks about "solving" maths problems. I wonder if reading a proof uses the language processing. To me I feel like it must do. The subjective experience to me of reading a proof is similar to reading any reasoned argument (like a legal argument).</p>
<p>The study was conducted with relatively novice coders. As it mentions, maybe the more proficient make more use of language processing.</p>
<p>Definitely a very interesting experiment though. The assumption that programming is a language task is pretty baked in to a lot of people's thinking.</p>
<p>This jumped out at me as well;</p>
<blockquote><p>because computer programming is such a new invention that &gt; we know that there couldn't be any hardwired mechanisms that make us good programmers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is strictly true. While obviously such abilities couldn't have risen via evolution yet (in response to programming being invented), it could still be the fact that there are hardwired mechanisms hanging around that make us good programmers. It certainly seems to me at least (controversial maybe!) that there is some kind of correlation with ASD tendancies and coding ability (in the present-of-coding anyway). Probably my #1 favourite observation of BV (the people we think of as good programmers are the people who are best at "playing</p>
<p>computer" in their head).</p>

When academic research is done well, deep work is essential, and being a full-time scientist is (although that’s dying now too with increased demands) one of the few places where success isn’t possible WITHOUT this type of deep focus and concentration. Especially for non-experimental fields like math and computer science. Cal Newport, author of Deep Work and a theory professor himself, talks about this allll the time on his blog and his podcast.</p>
<p>The way I see it, new knowledge is the ‘goal’ of academic research. Deep thoughts &amp; deep work are what’s necessary to produce said new knowledge. Really getting to the bottom of things, understanding why X doesn’t work but Y could work, and chasing those ideas for the sake of them. The author probably hasn’t interacted with many FoC people 🙂 so they default to the place / arena they know well (academic research)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SriniKadamati">Srini Kadamati</a> I find the characterization of the difference in development process between older and newer languages in this post a bit odd. For example, the first Lisp interpreter was a weekend hack by Slug Russell and C was bashed together quite quickly by non-academic practitioners to solve their own problems. Most of the grand pseudo-academic committee languages of yesteryear were popular failures, like PL/I and ADA, and the ones that succeeded did so largely because of massive corporate propaganda efforts (Cobol, Java).</p>

<p>But I don't really get why number of processes is such an obvious metric here. He gets into the need for kernels to be small and most work to be done in userland, which is reasonable. But when we have billions of cycles to work with, it seems reasonable to have lots of user processes doing useful work for, you know, the user. And user processes benefit just as much from shared libraries as kernel processes.</p>
<hr><p>You're right that his desire for processes to communicate via shared memory without any marshalling or unmarshalling is straight out of the Smalltalk playbook.</p>
<p>More than STEPS, the work I'd point him at is <a href="https://arcan-fe.com"></a><a href="https://arcan-fe.com">https://arcan-fe.com</a>. Particularly principle 6 of <a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6"></a><a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6">https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/#p6</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An application does not get to disturb you by ‘asking for permission’ just to steal data from a sensor – it always gets some kind of data. You decide, dynamically, which sensor that is actually sampled and what that entails. Access the ‘camera’ does not automatically imply sampling the actual device, it means being routed a video stream. The user decide what that stream covers and when.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, apps should be able to read the file system. They just shouldn't ever be sure it's the real file system.</p>
<p>Accessing the file system is the least of our privacy or security worries on a modern computer. All our data is over the network. Malicious code could read your data from one remote location and exfiltrate it to another remote location without ever hitting the local file system. Arcan thinks about the entire security envelope.</p>
<hr><p>I feel for his desire to do away with device drivers and graphics accelerators, but it just doesn't reconcile with geopolitical realities. Companies control the hardware they produce. Consumers don't prioritize openness of interfaces. Incumbents don't care about enabling new OSs.</p>
<p>He's a game programmer and he needs the graphics acceleration. Sucks to be in that position. I feel fortunate that I can just say, "a pox on all your houses," and want less from my graphics card.</p>

He also dismisses a question about what I can only interpret to mean “how do you overcome the network effects of existing software / apps?“.  People have tried late-stage mobile operating systems and they don’t work b/c people want their existing apps to just work. Ultimately his bias is definitely towards a simple, gardened computing system that works for him (runs games, creates slides, stream stuff, and be super fast &amp; light). But if a new cool sleek minimal OS can’t run Zoom or w/e, its gonna struggle.</p>
<p>As with most new paradigms, I personally think the only way we get new operating systems is in new modes of computing // major hardware changes. Windows OS in VR is a silly idea (its like how film was recorded plays for a while, not native to the medium). Same with AR / AR equivalents.</p>

<p>You can either try to reinvent OSs or you can try to run all software. Trying to do both fatally over-constrains the problem.</p>
<p>And we don't need to eradicate current computers. The number of devices per human is growing exponentially. No reason the new can't coexist with the old. "My other laptop is a Porsche."</p>
<hr><p>Re VR: Any OS that just surfs hardware shifts is doomed to be as crappy as the old paradigm 😄 Chasing market share will take you, fast failing, to the same lucrative dead end the previous generation of chasing market share ended up. To be better you have to know what forces shaped the past, and which of those forces you are going to avoid.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree but I think that new OS has to be much better / focused for a specific set of use cases where people are willing to let go of the network effects. That’s super super hard, especially in the networked computing world we live in</p>

I really liked how candid the speaker was about the challenges of debugging low-level systems like device drivers. According to them, Scheme gives you a nice REPL for debugging hard-to-reproduce bugs in low-level code like device drivers. However, the cost at the moment is that you have to deal with GC occurring at inopportune times, something a less capable language would shield you from.</p>
<p>I'm just starting to get into OS development, and I'm acutely aware of the benefits on the other side of the fence (bootstrapping OS capabilities using a language, rather than bootstrapping language capabilities using an OS, as Mu does). This is a useful project to keep on my radar, if only to better understand the sort of debugging they've had to learn to do.</p>

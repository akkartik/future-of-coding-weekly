<p>.Not sure I get where you're going with this, üòû sorry. Can you elaborate a little? Do you mean scaling up with different points of view? Thus harder to settle on common data types for shared data? That is, models that are specific to a person or group versus sharable models.</p>

<p>.Yeah well you're a techie! You're not supposed to know about "objects"! I can't find another suitable name that hasn't already been used and isn't already loaded with meaning. Entities, Datachunks, Things, Stuffbits?? And for non-techies, "object" conveys what I want very well. Something tangible and real that has innate properties. There are no technical aspects to this page outside the experience of normal non-techies, at least that's my hope..</p>

<p>.Fediverse is an interesting lead - thanks for reminding me about that, I've seen it before but not dug in.</p>
<p>Access rights, auth: yes, as an owner you have rights. No one can edit an object apart from you unless you permit it. That's the plan. Not written that bit yet in the current (C) implementation!</p>

<p>.Yes, I've been researching existing P2P infra to build upon. I ended up with a shortlist of one: OpenDHT! Trouble is that it has to (a) be written in C (or have a C header file) (b) NOT be bloody blockchain based! (c) be active and used not academic. I'll dig some more into Hypercore though, so thanks for that!</p>

<p>.OK, not sure about "kook vibes", but I get that some folks won't be motivated by the P2P-ness and freedom aspects. Many do though, especially recently.</p>

<p>.Nope, no apps. That's the point. Give up apps, give up their prison and their control and surveillance. Get freedom. I guess that either is or isn't a motivation for a given person!</p>
<blockquote><p>I think maybe you need to come at it from the direction of what problems you are promising to solve. Rather than bashing on Instagram, say how you will make it better, stuff like that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.The problem is that we have given up control. The Object Network solves that problem. So bashing on Insta is part of the story!</p>
<p>Thanks again for the experiment, it's useful from a "framing the audience" point of view to know that there are people out there who are happy with how things are. Which is great! :-D</p>

<p>This is about people helping each other create a shared, open cyberspace that they own themselves, and where they build functionality together (not apps, but useful open source, sharable behaviours for objects).</p>

As for P2P, it seems that C is not popular at all in that space. The main P2P software I actually use daily is Syncthing, written in Go. IPFS is Go and JS. All of them could be implemented in C, being defined in terms of protocols rather than APIs, but nobody does it. I guess it's a cultural issue: C is the lingua franca of Unix and a process-centric view of computing. P2P takes a data-centric and network-based approach. Rejecting the "old world" leads to rejecting its lingua franca as well.</p>

<p>Yeah, for sure, stack depth feels like less of a constraint compared to line length and how much horizontal space we devote to the stack state of each word.</p>
<p>I don't care about compatibility with Unix or functional equivalence. Just something that is internally consistent and reasonably discoverable. I think if push came to shove I'd make the same trade-off as everyone else and compromise on discoverability.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You're right. If we can solve the problem of wide values on the stack, long lines seem viable.</p>
<hr><p>One constraint I hadn't mentioned until now: I'd like for the number of hotkeys this environment needs to be small enough that I can describe them all in the menu at the bottom for some reasonable screen width. Excluding intuitive stuff like arrow keys.</p>
<p>I think I have a new idea after this thread. Values on the stack will have 3 possible states: collapsed, truncated and maximized. By default, any value wider/taller than some threshold will be collapsed -- except at the top of the stack, where it's truncated to the threshold width and height by default.</p>
<p>Now we need just one new hotkey: toggle the top of stack at the cursor between trunated and maximized.</p>
<p>Maximize does exactly what it sounds like. It puts you in full screen mode browsing the data as necessary. The idea is to avoid any ambiguity about what will scroll. No nested scrollbars.</p>
<p>Values in the stack are always in read-only mode when maximized; you can only browse within them. This suggests an analogous maximized edit mode for input words (say literal strings or arrays). But I haven't thought that angle through.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like this to be the totality of the UI (or some single prototype UI) for the Mu computer. Just text mode, no mouse. A single cursor on screen, an infinite 2D space that you can move around in, containing panels (functions or sandboxes) that in turn contain values. Panels and values can be collapsed or maximized. Everything one can do to be done within this framework, whether it's editing code or browsing data or running programs. (Tentatively I imagine a single address space so strong sandboxing, no concurrency only lazy streams.)</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I've been noodling on how to do conditionals in my postfix shell. Some ideas for keywords/functions:</p>
<ul><li><p><code>return</code> seems quite essential. Stops executing the current function and returns top of stack.</p>
</li><li><p><code>if{</code> and <code>}</code> and <code>}else{</code>. Here's how factorial would look with them:</p>
</li></ul><pre><code>n fact

  = n 1 &lt;= if{ 0 return } n 1- fact n *</code></pre><ul><li><code>-&gt;</code> executes rest of line only if top of stack is true. Factorial again, this time in two lines:</li></ul><pre><code>n fact

  = n 1 &lt;= -&gt; 0 return

    n 1- fact n *</code></pre><ul><li><p><code>-&lt;</code> executes one of the next two words depending on whether top of stack is true or false.</p>
</li><li><p><code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&lt;</code> may also work well with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> which group words together:</p>
</li></ul><pre><code>n fact

  = n 1 &lt;= -&gt; {0 return} n 1- fact n *</code></pre><p>A more challenging example is binary search. The gold standard here is Bret Victor's demo in "Inventing on Principle" (linked above; screenshot below). Some attempts in postfix:</p>

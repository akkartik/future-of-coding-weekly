<p>I know you are doing teasers right now. But seeing the process of building up to this point would super illustrative. Like what went into making that little card view with the list of customers? Is that some builtin way of displaying lists? Or something custom?</p>
<p>You mentioned it knowing that contract value is important. Is there some metadata that tells it that? Is importance builtin?</p>
<p>I will just say that these teasers are definitely doing their job of interesting me üôÇ</p>
<p>Allowing you to build these sorts of nice UIs for questions you want to ask is really wonderful. This looks like an ideal way to build tools for myself that I always want to build, but can never find the time to. I can‚Äôt wait to play with this.</p>

Working in this system is effectively an exercise in defining the nouns and verbs of the world, which we then utilize to automatically provide stuff like this. The card view is one of 3 ways we know to display collections (card stack, table, and grid). You can think of importance as a kind of contextual score that takes into account everything we know. That includes how often things get asked about or are used in the program, statements you may have made about goals, direct statements of importance, its distance from your current context, etc.</p>

E.g. you had a bug in production, with this system you can perfectly replay the bug, but it turns out the root cause actually happened weeks ago when some bad value was introduced into the system. No worries, it can go back and historically replay the exact cause of that errant value two weeks ago and then you just‚Ä¶ fix it</p>

If there are alternative interpretation of the steps, you can pop those open and select one. We don‚Äôt let you modify the steps directly, but there‚Äôs nothing that prevents it. Though those steps need to be completely unambiguous so you have to type what the system actually knows. e.g. you can‚Äôt say ‚Äúburning‚Äù you have to say ‚Äúon fire‚Äù because that‚Äôs it‚Äôs actual name. You could imagine doing that as more of a spectrum, where you could start typing ‚Äúburning‚Äù and autocomplete would insert ‚Äúon fire‚Äù</p>

<p>It could reasonably be parsed as either (in Cypher QL);</p>
<blockquote><p> (n:User)-[:FRIEND_OF]-&gt;(m:User) where m.is_new and n.has_picor</p>
<p> (n:User)-[:FRIEND_OF]-&gt;(m:User) where m.is_new and &gt; m&gt; .has_pic</p>

<p>i.e. either "friends of (new users with pic)" or "[friends of (new users)] with pic".</p>
<p>Neither is wrong, but I'm wondering how you choose between them.</p>

Definitely had a little "aha" moment at 6:20 when the switch finally worked üòÄ</p>
<p>I think the best-in-class for this type of video is Ben Eater. Here's his latest one - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUTHtNrpwiI"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUTHtNrpwiI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUTHtNrpwiI</a></p>
<p>I think he edits it so that it seems like it is live but I am sure he actually carefully scripts and narrates over it. He leaves the little mistakes in (as you did) because I think they are important for understanding.</p>
<p>So basically I think it should still have voiceover but you should also edit/condense it. Stuff like changing colours (which still takes quite a long time, but is conceptually boring) can be whisked past.</p>
<p>Other stuff, I think you need to signpost ahead of time what you are intending to do, then do, then show it working. Like: "Ok, now I'm going to try and make this platform move backwards when I flip the button. First, I'm going to need...". This will help follow the design thought process.</p>
<p>(Personal preference but I also found the music kind of annoying, especially when it changed)</p>
<p>All in all, a really great project, will follow closely!</p>

I didn't like the music much either but I was experimenting to see if people prefer the videos without my voice (I do have an accent and personally I find videos with accents a little annoying) and I had to put something in its place. I thought about speeding up the boring parts but I thought maybe some people would like to follow along and wouldn't like me to skip anything. Maybe I can solve that problem with just the highlights slowed down on youtube and a full normal speed video on patreon, it could even earn me a bit, we'll see. Thanks again, very good points.</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider the powerful, time-honored environment that gives us many ‚Äúsmall programs, each doing one thing well‚Äù, the Unix shell. There is a &gt; <code>cut</code>&gt;  command, a &gt; <code>sort</code>&gt;  command, and many more. A versatile collection of blocks that I can snap together in different ways (yay pipes!). There isn‚Äôt much duplication of commands and the environment seems to have nice composition properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it only goes so far.</p>
<p>If I write a program in Unix using Java or Python, can I reuse the Unix &gt; <code>sort</code>&gt;  to sort an array of items inside my program? Of course not, what an improper question! The decent choice is to reimplement sorting in my program (or use the standard library where someone else has already re-implemented it).</p>
<blockquote><p>The computer already knows how to sort things, why do I need to tell it again?</p>

<p>From the inventor of shells:</p>
<blockquote><p>I felt that commands should be usable as library subroutines, or vice versa. This stemmed from my practice of writing CTSS [OS] commands in MAD, a simplified Algol-like language. It was much faster and the code was more maintainable than IBM 7094 assembly code. Since I needed MAD-friendly subroutine calls to access CTSS primitives, I wrote in assembly code a battery of interface subroutines, which very often mimicked CTSS basic command functions. I felt it was an awkward duplication of effort. However, I did not go further in the context of CTSS.</p>

It's actually a condition for productively moving on to higher abstraction levels. The reason we can discuss information management at the byte level (and higher) is that we do have standards for storing and communicating bytes. Even the byte itself as a practical unit of information is a standard.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of computing, it started out, like other technologies, with cycles of messy innovation followed by standardization. Until about the year 2000. All major standards of the computing world were created before 2000, although some have been updated since. But nobody seems to be interested in standardization any more. Tech is dominated by a few big players whose game is "Who can impose their conventions on the rest of the world?" And even small players accept this game, proposing new ideas they consider "better", and thus deserving to "win" by the ideas of meritocracy. Some have been cited above.</p>
<p>So what happened to the idea of compromise for the benefit of everyone? Many technical issues are reasonably well understood. We know about the relative benefits of function calls with on-stack argument passing, subprocess creation with command-line arguments, and other techniques for calling code blocks. A committee of experts could come up with a minimal list of techniques that cover the various use cases/priorities, and write up a standard with something like three or four calling conventions. If everybody accepted and implemented them, we could then move on to discussing higher levels of abstraction. But this isn't happening. There is no incentive for agreeing with others. Can we fix that somehow?</p>

<p>It's natural for higher-level abstractions to take longer to stabilize. In some sense they have more degrees of freedom in their design, so there's an exponentially larger search space. More tradeoffs to optimize, with more local minima.</p>

This is the option 2 I was suggesting earlier in the thread. Eg. with TCP/IP you don't have to stay stuck to copper wire or powerline or whatever it was originally designed with. You can switch those around even later while the systems using it continue to work. Same thing with 'bits'. This is why I am interested in models that are "not bits" however "can be mapped to bits many different ways". BTW, transmitting and storing information is a subset of organizing computation (e.g. decomposing into processes, defining execution models), so doing this abstract model for distributed computation is much harder.</p>
<p>One more thing I find very interesting is that software gives us a new superpower for achieving standardization because it is "virtual". Imagine you could magically and instantaneously ship FM receivers to everyone in the world. The shift from AM radio to FM would be overnight. With software, the limitations of hardware are gone, you can actually ship such software receivers. Yet we live in a world where switching to a new software protocol or media format is very burdensome. Our standard-making ideas are holdovers from a hardware world. So maybe instead of making software standards we usually do,we should be inventing new standard-making software (i.e. standardize the meta level)?</p>

I've had several decades experience of OOP in an industrial programming setting, I see a lot of problems, and I'm looking for better methodologies.</p>
<p>I like the philosophy behind modular programming (eg, as seen in SML). Your code is decomposed into modules, on the criterion of information hiding. A module encapsulates an important design decision, and hides the implementation of that decision behind an abstract interface. A module can contain a collection of functions, or it can encapsulate a single data type together with operations on that type, hiding the types representation. Or it can encapsulate 2 or more closely related data types, hiding their representations and exporting operations on those types. But, and this is important, there is no requirement that functions must be placed in the same module as the type of their first argument. That requirement would prevent you from modularizing your code effectively. Modules can be nested, and information hiding can occur at each level of nesting, if needed. At the top level, a package (the unit of software distribution across the internet) is also a module. The problem with class-based OOP is that the unit of modularity is the data type. This distorts the large scale structure of a system by inhibiting you from modularizing in the most effective way.</p>
<p>Inheritance in class-based OOP languages is a bad idea, it's the enemy of modularity. A modular should have a simple abstract interface that it easy to understand and document, and this interface should hide implementation details. Consider the interface to a class that exports virtual functions, and expects subclasses to override those virtual functions. In practice, the only way to understand such an interface is by reading the superclass's source code. Which is the opposite of abstraction and hiding implementation details.</p>

You system is composed of objects, each of which has an identity and mutable state, and you compute by sending messages to those objects, causing them to change their internal state. Shared mutable state is the source of massive complexity in software systems.</p>

The solutions I'm looking at are related to functional programming. Instead of mutable objects, you work with immutable values. Instead of "Object Oriented Design", I'm learning "Algebra Driven Design", where you consider a type (a set of immutable values), together with constructors for those values, and operations on those values, as an algebra. You work out the equational laws that relate these constructors and operations, and that gives you the abstract interface and the semantics of your algebra (which is a kind of module). My experience so far is that this design methodology can produce simple, elegant and powerful interfaces that have a quality of "life" that I would not be able to reproduce in any other way. I found the book "Algebra Driven Design" to be helpful in learning how this works.</p>

These are the ones I could find so far:</p>

And I mean they're truly just functions: all of the operations upon them are just operations upon functions, and thus they might be repurposed for other uses as well. Javascript and Lua kind of do this, except their philosophy is more like "all collections are just dictionaries", where a dictionary is a heavily-restricted class of function.</p>
<p>This approach ("all collections are just functions") seems like a versatile foundation (especially in the context of the semantics of the programming language I'm working on), so I've been digging into the ramifications of it lately. My biggest challenge so far is figuring out how to identify for which functions operations like set union and intersection are computable. Depending on how the function is constructed/defined, it seems like it could be quite hard to figure out a static "safety check". I want these operations to be well-defined even on recursively-defined functions, so it's not as simple as "ensure the function definition is just a finite list of cases" (i.e, a dictionary).</p>
<p>This doesn't seem unreasonable: Datalog works this way. Datalog predicates are recursively-defined functions from X ‚Üí Bool (i.e. sets) that obey certain constraints so that queries upon them are answerable.</p>

<p>The biggest question is: how do you support other operations than construction or membership? I.e. set size, or more generally, iteration?</p>
<p>Lists like you represent them have a similar problem. If you want to iterate, at what index will you start and end?</p>
<p>Representing collections as functions is something that people tried to figure out in the lambda calculus a lot. You might be interested in e.g. fold lists.</p>

One possibility I'm considering is identifying classes of function where the codomain has some "zero value", and allowing the range of those functions to be summed if the domain maps to finitely-many non-zero values. These conditions are obeyed by finite sets, and by finite lists whose codomain is a "Maybe" type (sets of size 0 or 1). "Safe" functional languages already handle list indexing using Maybes, so it doesn't seem that bizarre.</p>
<p>It does seem a little bit hacky though!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know of many languages that do this, though, probably for efficiency reasons. Adding an element to a set means allocating a new closure.</p>

I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs addressed the above ideas; I‚Äôve only seen his stuff on recursive algebraic data types, which these are not. I‚Äôm avoiding/disowning ADTs in my language.</p>
<p>And to be clear, I‚Äôm not interested in exploring mathematical curiosities and publishing a library or a paper, I‚Äôm interested in building a practical programming language, so the constraints of existing language implementations aren‚Äôt of concern to me. A language designed around data structures being encoded as functions isn‚Äôt going to be allocating millions of closures every second. Functions are just the interface; the implementation can do anything semantically equivalent!</p>

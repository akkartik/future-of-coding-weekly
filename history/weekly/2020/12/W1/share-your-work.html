<p>Thinking about it some more I guess you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs useful to separate knowledge representation from computation. Is that right?</p>

The specification of sorting is</p>
<ol start="1"><li><p>L' = sorted(L) is a list with the same elements as the list L</p>
</li><li><p>The elements x_i of L' satisfy x<em>i &lt;= x</em>{i+1}.</p>
</li></ol><p>There are many algorithms satisfying this specification (quick sort, heap sort, etc.). The information content of specification and implementation is very different, as neither one is trivially derived from the other. It requires non-trivial creative work to find an algorithm satisfying a specification, and it also requires a serious effort for someone else than the author to prove that a given algorithm actually satisfies the specification, although that direction is in general simpler.</p>
<p>In mathematics, we have exactly the same relation between equations and their solutions, so we can say that equations are specifications for their solutions. They provide a criterion to check if a solution is correct, but no help at all for actually finding a solution, which therefore requires non-trivial creative work.</p>

More importantly, most scientific insight has been derived from the equations rather than from their solutions (which however are very important to check that the model actually describes reality). Example: you can derive energy conservation from Newton's equations, but not from any one of its many solutions.</p>

Thinking about this as both a learning resource (quickly see lots of examples for a task or language) and an actual benchmark (eg compare lines of code or other metrics).

Though there are no fancy demos this time around, can see this as taking some neat moves that will pay off in the (immediate) future. Also carving out the problem space to just map projections for now is a smart move. Will help you focus on solving bug problems one step at a time. All in all, pretty promising and would love to see what comes out.</p>
<p>One question I had was: How would you declare constants and static snapshot of a dynamic thing in this environment? Like a constant is a variable that doesnt change, so thats easy to pull off but with re: static, I mean something that was dynamic and bound previously, but now you need to reify the result as a sort of new input to another function but not with the bindings. Is there a way to bind and unbind variables like this? I could supply an example if that description was not clear.</p>

You want to extract out this value and make it a static thing instead of it acting in the continuum. How would you accomplish that? Like say you have x = 10 points with x, y coordinates. Then you perform, reflectHorizontally(rotate(x)) generating a set of points. My impression with the two demos is that the value x is bound continuously throughout the transformation in the env. Now, you want to extract out, elements 1,2, and 7 out of the result and then store it as y which you will pipe through another set of transformations to produce z. So rewinding the story so far, we have x morphing into y morphing into z. Now, in a typical bound set up, the changes in x will be continuously mirrored to y and z. What I meant by static is, y when reified/extracted out of this abstract chain, will become a sort of end product of the transformation of x and  then become a non-live value changing/parametrizing which will change z independent of transformations that can happen to x. Hope the use case I had in mind is conveyed with this.</p>

<p>I think your "problem" that the students would "just sort the list instead of demonstrating the algorithm that they're meant to learn" is a feature disguised as a bug. When someone says to you "this list needs to be sorted", it's natural to sort the list in an ad-hoc way. Personally I even do this when I'm programming: if I'm trying to write an alg for some tricky general case, I first try to do a case or two by hand.</p>
<p>So I'd say it might be good to allow people to start with the ad-hoc/by-hand sorting, and then try to generalize slowly.</p>

<p>Though you haven't shown this yet, the main code-ish quality that I hope for in UIs like this is being able to get a sense of everything that has been said.  What is actually in this document?  With a lot of tools, inspector sniffing is the only way to find out and even then you don't know if a value is default, computed, or explicit.  Code, of course, answers the explicit part, but often thorough API knowledge is required to know even the most basic consequences.</p>

Specially the wiki page aspect. Somewhat tangential but I've always wanted a hypermedia store for code/models. E.g. even in traditional programming, instead of thinking of a function definition as an disjoint blob of text that happens to include the name of a type or of another function, consider a "function page" is linked to a "type page" and to other function pages via hyperlinks. These are resolved at edit time and stored as links. Can be extended to any kind of code objects and even mix in comment pages.</p>

It's basically a "backend builder" (hosted db, models, CRUD and custom API, Admin UI) that helps developers build feature rich backends quickly. It speeds up your work by reducing the need for boilerplate, glue code, or bits and pieces you've built a million times (auth, permissions, ...) and it leaves you to code the unique bits of the problem. The best way to think about Gadget is that it's LOW CODE FOR DEVELOPERS. We believe that there's a certain way of thinking, modelling and coding that's necessary to build scalable applications. As such, we're not necessarily huge fans of the no-code movement as a whole, but there are certain aspects we like and we've tried to bring that to a developer audience.</p>
<p>This demo is ten minutes long. And I build a real, live app in that time. The alpha is open to anyone who wants to give us feedback and totally free. DM me if you're interested. Tx for your time and feedback.</p>

<p>I am working on a project that is sharing the same vision (low code for developers, remove the boilerplate and accidental complexity) so I really like the general idea and direction -&gt; we are approaching it the other way though, but I think a lot of ideology is similar.</p>
<p>I like the UI üòÑ, it looks polished and smooth.</p>
<p>What is the stage of the project, what are you focusing on -&gt; getting it to be stable, adding more features? What are some of the main challenges you encountered, both in designing such system and in implementing it? I am guessing there is a plan to monetize hosting of these apps on your cloud, which makes sense. What if multiple developers want to work together, I guess that is coming in the future? Tests?</p>
<p>Sorry for a lot of questions, and again, I really like the idea but even more how polished even the alpha seems!</p>

<p>1- We're launching little alphas as we go, so currently in alpha for the "hosted db/CRUD and custom API builder". Just friends and acquaintances who want to try it out and give us feedback or have very simple app ideas (light CMS, side project)</p>
<p>2- We spent the last few weeks cleaning up the bugs from our first alpha so we're now lookign to add a few features</p>
<p>3- We've been giving a lot of thought to the abstraction and the interplay between our code and how it interfaces with your code in a way that still allows us to manage scaling long term. Keeping Javascript in neat little boxes where it's safe to run 3p JS, thinking about building a simple expression language for added performance on things like conditions and validations... My business partner <a href="https://twitter.com/harrybrundage">Harry Brundage</a> can probably list more</p>
<p>3- Ya, too early to tell but prolly something like Heroku. Generous free tier to get people to try it. Charge for hosting and/or charge a monthly fee for more advanced features (collaboration, environments, or anything that makes it clear Gadget has become your "IDE")</p>
<p>Tons to build so our focus is on light backend use cases as we build features and move upwards.</p>
<p>4- This is similar to Parse Cloud. (which FB killed years ago) A lot of the value of the abstraction comes because it's a bundled, cloud product. We actually know the Parse CEO and he's given us some tips and tricks on  how to take this to market.</p>

<p>It's about a completely new testing methodology that doesn't use "tests as functions with asserts" like every other testing methodology I've seen, but tests as JSON data.</p>
<p>The coolest part about it? When tests are json data, the computer can generate the "expected test output" for you automatically, so all you need to do is specify the test and the computer fills out what it "should be." Then as a human, you can just verify it with your eyeballs (and in many cases, another program) and not have to type it out or extract correct answers from assert messages.</p>

<p>From what I learned so far, they are good for a situation where you want to ensure that a specific part of the system does not change its outputs, but you don't want to describe those outputs manually, usually because they are too complex for that. It is not there to replace the classical TDD, but to complement it for these specific situations.</p>

<p>I think I agree that I prefer text mode. It's a little bit frustrating not having completely free control of the cursor.</p>
<p>It might be possible to bring the best of both worlds together by moving all of the structural features into a type of autocomplete. You could hold a modifier (e.g. ctrl) which would then indicate the action that return, delete, arrows etc now have.</p>
<p>So if the cursor is after the @ of an @ rule, then backspace would just delete the @ character as normal, whereas holding ctrl would highlight the whole outer rule in red, maybe say "unwrap", then pressing ctrl+backspace would be the equivalent of "unwrap at rule".</p>
<p>Similarly, return would always just insert a new line (including splitting a word if you are inside one), but holding ctrl would preview a new declaration, and ctrl+return would be the same as Insert Declaration.</p>

I like the idea of normal text editing but using keyboard modifiers to trigger ‚Äúsmart‚Äù navigation/edits.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also thinking about a contextual panel that updates as you move your cursor, similar to the demo but keeping text as the main UI.</p>

<p>Say, everything in your <code>.container</code> from the example css turns into a normal editor, and you can go up and down the tree that way. That way you can do a first rough pass with plain text mode, and once you get it about right keep working on structured mode. Best of both worlds? üôÇ</p>

It looks like it remembers the column I click on, and tries to return to it when I move up/down. This happens even if I move left/right with keyboard.</p>
<p>Have you seen Jetbrains MPS? It allows free cursor movement, just like normal text editors. Not all positions are fully editable, but they can have some useful commands attached. As an example, if you place cursor after the closing <code>}</code>, pressing backspace would delete the whole rule. You can also create other ‚Äúsmart‚Äù commands. For example, pressing <code>,</code> after the selector can automatically start another selector (pressing <code>,</code> in the middle could split it, etc.).</p>
<p>If you're serious about structured editors, I highly recommend trying MPS out. They have implemented many good ideas so that structured editing feels like text editing most of the time.</p>

I'm guessing the author wants to come up with something he could embed on a web site as editor.</p>
<p>The thing I have in mind is different from MPS in that it would fully switch to edit some subgraph of the AST with plain text, so after exiting the subgraph would have to be parsed to get it back to structured mode.</p>
<p>A user wouldn't be able to exit "plaintext mode" until the subgraph parses properly. Probably easier to implement than the quasi-seamless "simulation of plaintext" MPS tries to achieve.</p>

<p><a href="https://emmanueloga.com/">Emmanuel Oga</a> the demo does have a text mode (button at top) which won‚Äôt switch back unless text parses.

The bigger the gap, the better having a structural editor is going to be.  Plain CSS isn't going to have as rich of a structure as <a href="http://lesscss.org/#"></a><a href="http://lesscss.org/#">http://lesscss.org/#</a> or <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide"></a><a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide">https://sass-lang.com/guide</a>.  On the other hand, some CSS features have long distance dependencies: <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/5-cool-css-grid-generators"></a><a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/5-cool-css-grid-generators">https://www.creativebloq.com/features/5-cool-css-grid-generators</a>, <a href="https://loading.io/flexbox/"></a><a href="https://loading.io/flexbox/">https://loading.io/flexbox/</a>, <a href="https://divtable.com/"></a><a href="https://divtable.com/">https://divtable.com/</a> layouts.  Anytime there are connections between many related properties, a structural editor may be worth it.  Consider the CSS developer tools in browsers.  Tools that help represent interaction of rules, and tools that help you adjust those interactions to produce a desired effect.  A domain independent tree-structure editor will be less of a win over text editing than a domain dependent assistance. An advantage of making the editor strongly structural with tooling is that you don't need to represent all kinds of invalid text states.  The flip-side is that the direct path a useful transformation sometimes passes through invalid intermediate states.  Giving meaning to those is a classic mathematical activity.</p>

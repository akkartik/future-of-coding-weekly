<p>A potentially better, but more conceptually challenging step, is having a system that's really good at assisting with order.  People have certainly looked into this with types and contracts and what have you, but I don't feel like it's been nailed.  AOP, for instance, was good for describing long distance ordering constraints as a double check.</p>

But that leaves two questions: 1. what is the value of re-organizing the code, just to allow me move my mouse less? 2. The pointcut / advice seems complex. My recent thought on this is: The value of re-organize the code is to re-design the dependency relationship between packages. If cross cutting concern extracted out into same package, there is little extra benefit. If extracting cross cutting concern allows us to optimize the dependency graph, so that more package can be removed from dependency list, it worth the trouble. It is just a package management game in the end.</p>

<pre><code>ANTLR v4 is the result of a minor detour (twenty-five years) I took in graduate school. I guess I'm going to have to change my motto slightly.

Why program by hand in five days what you can spend twenty-five years of your life automating?

ANTLR v4 is exactly what I want in a parser generator, so I can finally get back to the problem I was originally trying to solve in the 1980s.

Now, if I could just remember what that was.</code></pre><p><a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf"></a><a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf">http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/preface.pdf</a></p>
<p>I wonder how this resonates with people on this community.</p>
<p>On the one hand I love building tools, but in the other, there are so many apps I want to build... I don't necessarily want to spend a lot of time building a "generalized problem solver" for each instance of the problem I want to solve.</p>
<p>As seen in ANTLR example, building a general tool can take years.</p>

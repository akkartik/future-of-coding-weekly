<p><a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit"></a><a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit">https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format#transit</a> is such a format, but I'd like to know if there are others.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine trying to represent JSON+Dates, and no other additional type.</p>
<p>From: <code>["a", 123, ..., "whatever", "~#date:1929292929"]</code> ...</p>
<p>... a JS decoder would see <code>"~#date:1929292929"</code> and convert that to <code>["a", 123, ..., "whatever", new Date(1929292929)]</code> .</p>
<p>What if I wanted to encode the <code>"~#date:1929292929"</code> string verbatim? Now I have to come up with some escaping mechanism, say, <code>~~</code> : <code>"~~~#date:1929292929"</code> , etc.</p>
<p>So I could try to come up with a format to do what I need, but I wonder if there are already specs out there doing something similar other than transit.</p>
<p>I want something a bit easier to implement than Transit... it has a bit more features than I need (for instance, I don't really need caching or user defined types).</p>

<blockquote><p>Users of data formats without such facilities must rely on either schemas, convention, or context to convey elements not included in the base set, making application code much more complex. With Transit, schemas, convention, and context-sensitive logic are not required.</p>

<p>I suppose conventions and schemas is what we're both reaching for. I just haven't felt this particular pain point yet..</p>

Depending on your context, the "~#" prefix might be enough, you might not even ever need to escape them.  Not if "~#" doesn't occur naturally.</p>
<p>Using a hash with a "type" key or perhaps a "<del>type</del>" key for extra safety is perhaps a more versatile (and verbose) solution.</p>
<p>The only downer of using extra ~s to meta-escape is that it can get silly sometime.  I vaguely recall a system wherein to write backslash I had to use the string <code>"\\\\\\"</code>.   So having another way to say backslash would have worked out better.</p>

<p>Actual transit ends up looking like a lot of nested arrays, something like:</p>
<p> <code>["~#array", [1, 2, [~#date 1929292929], [~#json, [1, 2, 1929292929]]]</code></p>

<p>Or you could use the same mechanism: <code>"~#string:'~#date:...'"</code></p>

It works but it has quite some layers of complexity (RDF+XML/XSLT).</p>
<p>It uses Saxon/JS. Saxon does what I'm asking: it expresses the full XSLT type system on top of JSON, it is just more than a bit hairy, as you can imagine... At the same time Saxon/JS lacks basic things like supporting async extension functions.</p>
<p>It occurred to me I could create a format to express both markup and graph data with an eye on building on top of JSON from the start, as opposed to the Frankenstein of tech I currently use.</p>
<p>Something like <a href="https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/egf"></a><a href="https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/egf">https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/egf</a> comes close but it is missing the markup part (mixed content).</p>
<p>For now I'm just looking at "prior art", specially if I can find very minimal formats that build on top of JSON without adding too much complexity to ... steal üôÇ .. some of the patterns people use when building on top of JSON.</p>

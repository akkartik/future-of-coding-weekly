But a bit different of a motivation.</p>
<p>I am building a very dynamic language.  A language that should have a very small core but with the power to implement most of the interesting things in itself.</p>
<p>I’ve done a bit of exploration building it in Clojure (my preferred language for many things) but found a few problems. First, the language I was making was being too heavily influenced by what was convenient for me to do in Clojure. I always ended up with a lispy thing just because I could do it quick. I know that if I stick with clojure those things will leak in more than I wanted and so I decided to not use it.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, I don’t want to spend time right now focused on speed, but I need an interpreter that is decently fast. Since most of the interesting things in my language should be implemented in itself, I will have a huge interpreter overhead. Of course, I could spend the time to optimize that away, but I’m still exploring the idea and optimization isn’t the interesting part. When I was doing things in clojure, my naive solution was already getting to the point where things weren’t interactive at the level I wanted them to be.</p>
<p>So for those reasons I chose Rust as my implementation language of choice. I know that in the future when I really care about the speed of everything I can make it fast. And for now, my super naive code is already fast enough for what I’m doing. I haven’t gotten quite to the point where I can really test the interpreter overhead. But I expect things to be fast enough that I can make all the ideas I have in my head in my language itself, keeping the rust I have to write to a very small amount (hopefully 500-1000 lines at most).</p>

That's reasonable as a goal for this particular page. (It's also why I find this page unsatisfying.) But it also seems reasonable for it to trigger conversations about the how. That doesn't feel like "missing the point". Isn't that sort of conversation what this page is designed to engender?
Yes, completely agreed. The mission page is trying to act as a list of ideals to aim for (and they aren't set in stone either, I'm sure they'll change and improve through feedback like this). It's great to see people talking about how they could be achieved, which goals are more important to them, etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will help to triangulate by bringing up my mission: <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>. Not to brag, but we're attacking highly overlapping if not isomorphic problems. By definition I should have addressed any shortcomings I bring up here. It stays high-level, focuses on goals, but also indicates the sorts of trade-offs I'm willing to make. I'd love to receive similar criticism from you about what it's lacking.
I agree, there's a good amount of overlap between the malleable principles and your own mission. Seems like we should continue to chat and compare notes as our efforts evolve. 😄</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About your own mission page, overall I think it's quite good! My initial comments are only about stylistic things like making section headers more visually distinct, since my ADHD-addled brain found it hard to scan. I think with a personal mission (like your page), where you're describing your personal vision, it makes sense to link goals, constraints, and solutions together like you have done.</p>
<p>For the malleable site, I'd like many different voices to contribute their own views, constraints, and solutions, so that's why I've been saying they make more sense to be separate elements from the list of ideals there: I expect there to be many different answers as different people get involved. For now, I'd like to at least collect such perspectives and encourage more discussion.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>Perhaps it would help to drill down into which comments you consider to be missing the point. It might require a private conversation, but it might help make this conversation more concrete.
There's a background level of startup-y noise in there, such as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858840">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858840</a>, but I never read HN these days, so perhaps that's actually a low amount of such things for the site. 😅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree there's useful feedback in there as well. 😄 Thanks for picking out those various threads and summarising the sentiment. I agree with your take on the ones you selected. I'll add them to my list of feedback to sift through for the future.</p>

<p>We all know how software was doing this bad waterfall thing, and now it's doing this good Agile thing, and everybody wants to be part of that story and be "Agile", whatever that really means.</p>

<p>Similar things can be said about the perceptions of OOP, "structured programming", and probably most other paradigms in software (regarding the how things "started bad" and now we do this new good thing -- but that's just a story, and not quite accurate; reality is much more complicated).

Everybody understands that writing a novel, writing a love letter, and writing technical documentation are very different things, even though all are prose.</p>
<p>Agile is about developing tools for rapidly changing or incompletely understood requirements. If you are working on the perfect contribution to the Obfuscated C Code Contest, then Agile is the last thing you want. Subsuming both problems under "software development" is not helpful.</p>

The main reasons for me were to
1) add another voice to ideas that I think are good
2) think through, clarify and organize some my thoughts - required when publishing (I find this also helps me 'move beyond' the specific idea to other ideas)
3) find folks interested in similar stuff and get comments, conversation and further evolution of the ideas</p>
<p>Specially wrt 3, I've been <em>very</em> happy with the comments threads that have built up on some pages.</p>
<p>I dont think one needs fully formed coherent ideas to publish. A post could be a vague idea, a proposition, a perspective etc. I would personally recommend a blog, 'digital garden' or collection of unorganized notes. This is not noise, I think, but just an space folks who so desire may visit, absorb, reflect and optionally comment. People are good at filtering.

1. The author references "Out of the Tar Pit", which persuasively argues that relational programming should be used for general purpose programming. <a href="http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf</a>
2. Every general purpose language has hierarchical data structures, and means for querying and updating these data structures. For my Curv language, I started by copying these features from popular languages. So, I have records and arrays; R.foo selects field 'foo' from R; A[i] selects element 'i' from A; etc. And I have multi-dimensional array slices. But I discovered you can't abstract properly over these language features, and they aren't properly composable. So I've broken down these features into orthogonal, composable query and update operators, and I have rediscovered the "Lens", popularized by Haskell, but Lens packages are popping up in every language. And I discovered that Lenses are good for building pure functional GUIs that are modular and composable (you use them to connect the model with the view and controller). And I noticed that my new query / update operators resemble relational algebra without the "join". So I'm looking at Tarpit and this paper, and wondering if I should just add a join.</p>

Quote:
• SQL has not been designed with composition and separation of concerns in mind,
• Avoiding strong coupling between subqueries tends to be very difficult in practice,
• Coupling hurts separation of concerns and software design.
This shows that embedding SQL in a programming language is not a great idea. It is a poor API, and this paper demonstrates a better alternative (the relational algebra).</p>

ADTs are heavily overused in OOP programming, and I'm not a fan of the style, but I still think we need abstract data types for at least some use cases. The ability to perform relational queries on compound data encapsulated in ADTs is cool.</p>

For one thing, in what sense are relations "first-class citizens"? Maybe I don't know the definition of a "relation". Also, why does the join work?
<code>project(
  join(suppliers, cities),
  [:sid, :name, :city, :country])</code>
does it choose implicitly to join on "city" just because the two tables both have a city column? But what if the column names don't match, and how is this going to work if two tables happen to share a column name but it is just a coincidence and not intended for joining?</p>
<p>I have always found relational algebra unnatural. In non-DB code, if you want to know what city a person lives in, it's just <code>person.address.city</code>... DBs are so clumsy in comparison, constantly making you think about how to join tables together while including and excluding the right data. You might say "well what if you want to know what people are associated with an address... not so easy then, huh?" Yeah, then I'd have to run a query like <code>people.Select(p =&gt; p.address).Where(a =&gt; a == address)</code>, but by golly, simple paths like <code>person.address.city</code>  are both very convenient and maximally efficient computationally.</p>

Relations are first class in Alf because relations can be directly manipulated as first class objects (of class "Relation") in the host language, Ruby. This is in contrast with the software he is comparing Alf to, which allow you to run SQL queries against an external relational database, but don't model the relations as objects. In 2013, maybe this was a bigger deal than it is today.</p>

But what does it mean for tables to be first class? Couldn't we say, for example, that that a growable list of records (objects with properties) in C# is basically the same as a table, and that it is first-class in some sense? It seems like maybe the goal is to make "query composition" first class, or something like that.</p>

I've seen your project when I was searching for existing solutions, it is indeed interesting. It is great that you are here also.</p>
<p>There are some things that I didn't like in loyc trees. Specifically use of literals.</p>
<p>I wanted this tree data structure to be used by as many parties as possible. I expected it to be easily stored as JSON in text file, stored as file tree in Git or tree in IPFS. Use of literals like uint64 goes against that, since Git files are not typed and JSON numbers are expected to be numbers of JavaScript, which are doubles internally and cannot denote max value of uint64.</p>
<p>Thus, allowing different kinds of literals might create a lot of friction, many little hacks how to denote this of that kind of literals in this or that storage.</p>
<p>My solution to that is to have only one kind of literal: binary blob. Other kinds of values can be denoted with a wrap that will be represented equally on all storage systems: <code>{"uint32": "\0x00000001"}</code></p>

Now, for LES3 I decided that in order to achieve better cross-language compatibility, it was necessary to not require all implementations to support data types like int64, so I introduced Custom Literals. I think I'll be changing the implementation of this at some point, but conceptually my new approach is that everything is a string, but could, incidentally, also be a number, a Regex, a boolean, or whatever. For example, a literal like <code>1234f</code> (single-precision float 1234) would be equivalent to <code>_f"1234"</code> in LES3 which is a character sequence <code>['1','2','3','4']</code> and a type marker <code>_f</code>  in which the leading underscore means "formatted as a number literal, if possible". So you can treat all literals as pairs of two strings.

Contrast that with Modula-2 which did not allow dynamic dependencies, and forced all IMPORT statements in the first lines of the program, so you can could scan them instantly to find out what other modules are needed. I am trying like heck to not need a tool like Bazel in my language. Especially with possible remote installation steps to consider, it is a very tricky problem indeed.</p>

<p>Hickey had that whole talk about decoupling the various semantics of “map” just to the extent that it could run in serial or in parallel, and it’s just plain impossible for every engineer to put that amount of thought into every bit of code they write. I feel that most of the lack of reuse / repo bloat is just that: someone writes a module that complects the type of input, type of output, programming language, runtime, threading model, framework, etc, and separating any of those is just so hard that it gets rewritten instead, but with all the same rigidness in a new configuration, because it’s still hard to write in a factored way.</p>

You try to use just one routine, but it calls 3 others which call 3 others, etc., leading to an above-linear increase in the number of included code accompanying the small piece you really wanted. Some languages are more easy to "tree shake" than others. I once converted a giant C program to Modula2, and the lines dropped in half, even though the languages are 1:1 identical in almost every statement. The trick was that in Modula2 you had to name every import, and it took work to do that, and to avoid that hassle, unconsciously you would write code that minimized dependencies, and the net result was a higher level of sharing. I would bet with their high salaries and consequent high quality of workers, Google is probably  better than average companies at encouraging code re-use, but Google cannot escape the fact that they are using C++, JS, Java, etc; all languages designed without much care about code re-use, so the geometric increases are going to happen whether they like it or not, simply because of the languages they are using. This same problem of "copy-pasta" i believe it is called happened at IBM many years ago. IBM actually encouraged duplication (!) because they felt that otherwise you would be breaking other people's projects with your changes, so they thought non-sharing was safer. Of course it leads to low productivity and the non-fixing of bugs across semi-shared code. Then you have the opposite approach in big open source projects where the damn thing is broken constantly, and you have to cherry pick the right release day to get something reasonably stable. No question in my mind that a world of interchangeable software parts is possible, and will represent a seismic shift in the industry.</p>

Modula2 was the 10 year later sequel to Pascal. The big improvement other than a few expansions of the type system so you could have POINTER TO ARRAY [-5..+5] OF A_RECORD, which beats the hell out of C's nutty notation, was the module system. Modula2 had a unique approach that actually Prof. Wirth discard as cumbersome in Oberon. In Modula-2 each module had 2 separate files, an implementation file (the big one with the actual code) and a definition module, which held publicly visible constants, types, and function declarations. You compiled each of these 2 files separately; the definition first of course. What this gave you is that once you pinned down the external aspects of a module you were free to change the implementation part, and any other module that depended on it did not have to be recompiled when you change only the implementation file; just relink the program and execute. This goes way beyond compiled headers in C, because most of the time you change something in the implementation module, and don't modify the number or type of function parameters. This means recompilation of a 100k line program takes seconds. For small projects it is like having a REPL. There is a freeware Windows compiler (formerly the Stony Brook compiler) on the ADW website. This was the compiler i used for the WIndows side, and there is a small german firm P1 that made the Macintosh compiler.</p>
<p>Anyway by forcing you to constantly evaluate what symbols are public or private, and being able to check that every call has the correct precise type, a great many errors are caught at compile time. Modula-2 was targeting system programming; it had no graphical primitives, so I used Win32 API and on the Macintosh the QuickDraw system (for OS7).  The way the language is structured, it drives you subtly towards a very modular type of coding style. You end up with various function libraries that tackle different tasks, and as your program gets larger you tend to make it even more modular and systematic. So it is a language that encourages virtue and a slightly lower exponent of expansion than C for example. When runtime checks are fully enabled in Modula-2 it puffs up the code by 30%, but that means you have tens of thousands of range checks, assignment compatibility, null pointer, etc. that are very helpful during testing. For golden master you turn them off and your program gets a big speed boost. Although i only got to speak with Prof. Wirth once, i consider myself a disciple of his Swiss school of programming which is all about neatness, economy, and rigor.</p>
<p>Modula2 as a language was damaged severely when Prof. Wirth made a sequel called Oberon, but in Oberon 1 he stripped out some very valuable features from Modula-2 and thus made it impossible for the Modula-2 users to move forward. This was not corrected until Oberon 2 and by that time the world has discovered the new panacea of OOP (a disaster IMHO), and Java ran away with the academic market. Modula2 did not have a good free compiler. Interestingly enough Logitech, the famous Mouse maker, was founded by a Swiss person, and they offered one of the first symbolic debuggers, which had the amazing feature that when your program crashed, it would save the entire state of memory and registers, and you could then browse the moment of the crash will full symbols. This post-mortem dump as it was called was a fantastic step forward over the memory dumps and very crude crash reporting systems of other languages.</p>
<p>I mention this because the single hardest feature of my Beads language is the ability to time travel debug post mortem from user submitted dumps. It is pretty easy on a huge development machine to support time travel debugging, but to do that in a shipping product in the customer hands, that is something you don't see often. It is the intermittent errors that are the hardest to debug in my experience, and recreating the exact conditions of the user can be often impossible. I think the biggest scandal in computers today is not the size of the code bases, because with enough sweat and blood you can get  code pretty clean; what is embarrassing is that all the big companies have bug reports numbering in the hundreds of thousands if not millions of open cases that will never get fixed because the staff "cannot duplicate".</p>

<p>An anecdote from 10 years ago - someone filed a ticket to request that the Python API for an internal service that I was maintaining be more Pythonic, which I guess it indeed wasn’t.</p>
<p>To motivate his case he linked to 3 Pythonic wrappers for the API in the Google code base.
This was quite fishy in my eyes - if someone already made a Pythonic wrapper why did the other two write their own rather than use it? So I checked and indeed those 2 were pieces of code that were used to obtain the coveted internal language proficiency certification called “Readability”. While that certification was easy to get for many, due to its conditions it was challenging specifically for those tasked with maintaining existing production systems, so they needed to write unnecessary duplicated code to get the certification..</p>
<p>This is a small example out of many of how the system incentivized inefficiency and work of lesser quality.</p>

Many a computer company lived on consulting fees earned programming in a supposedly easy to maintain language like COBOL. COBOL was verbose and very annoying. It did have BCD arithmetic and a convenient number formatting syntax, but overall was inferior. The same kind of decision was made to elevate Java to the #1 slot, when it is also a ponderous, ugly language. If your managers have no clue as to the quality of your work, they may indeed judge you "by the pound", and the more verbose the language, and the more copy/paste you perform, the higher your apparent productivity. The inability to measure and judge accurately the code quality of programmers is an interesting area. It is pretty easy for anyone to recognize good singing, dancing, and painting. Poetry is a great deal more subjective. I think programming is a great deal like mathematical poetry. And people f*cking hate poetry.</p>

They are notation for describing algorithms. For communicating ideas between human beings, just like written language. In the early days of programming, before the first compiler, we wrote programs in high level languages for the purpose of communicating algorithms between programmers, and mathematical notation was invented centuries before that. The lambda calculus is now considered an early programming language, but it was invented in the 1930's as a notation for describing recursive functions, and it clearly wasn't a "tool" then.</p>

Language is a technology: it is a tool of communication, and a tool of thought. We invented language as a tool, just as we invented flint knives and various other technologies in even earlier eras.</p>

You can't even consider running Elixir or Erlang without the special virtual machine. That runtime has a very clever heap-per-thread architecture, unique among languages, and if you have a task to do that requires 300,000 simultaneous threads, you are going to get pounded with memory management problems in any conventional runtime. Languages also don't agree on data types. C has a 2 value boolean. JS has a 3-value boolean (undefined, true, false), and Beads has  a 4-value boolean (undefined, error, true, false) in order to have a uniform top and bottom value for all data types. These types of minute details make data interchange basically impractical between languages, so the idea of a universal runtime is unrealistic in this universe.</p>

<p>Maybe that's a matter of which is faster to parse and interpret, if that's how it works (note: I'm only vaguely aware of what AWS lambda is). For example, compare:</p>
<p>(a, b) =&gt; a+b</p>

<p>I have my own ideas about replacing a compiler (and programming language), with composing regular old programming paraphernalia that generate the code you want, from whatever data / syntax you want. The main difference is that it's not something separate from the code that's "written in it", and it replaces programming language as a (metaphorical) framework, with language as a (literal!) code library.</p>
<p>I'll DM you</p>

The live coding field has grown over the past 20 years from <a href="http://art.runme.org/1107861145-2780-0/livecoding.pdf">a community of artists and researchers</a> interested in “changing rules while they are followed” -- that is, the creative practice of using a computer programming language as a live interface, mainly in the performing arts. This field has since grown into the international “<a href="https://toplap.org/">TOPLAP</a>” community, with <a href="https://toplap.org/nodes/">dozens of local nodes</a> and offshoots such as <a href="http://algorave.com/">Algorave</a> algorithmic dance music events, with events taking place in over a hundred cities with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/30/is-algorave-the-future-of-dance-music-sheffield-algomech-festival">growing</a> <a href="https://cdm.link/2018/05/inside-the-livecoding-algorave-movement-and-what-it-says-about-music/">media</a> <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/algorave/4">interest</a>.</p>
<p>Live coders have worked collectively to make their technology and culture accessible, with <a href="https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding#languages">almost all systems shared as free/open source software</a>, and attempts to instill <a href="https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines">inclusivity, diversity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Algorave/algoraveconduct">safety</a> across organisations and lineups. On this foundation, <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/">current research</a> in the field is increasingly looking outward, beyond now well-established practices such as <a href="https://algorave.com/">algorave</a>, livecode <a href="https://networkmusicfestival.org/">network music</a> and <a href="http://www.ludions.com/texts/2007a/">slow coding</a>. This includes new interfaces based on old practices including the <a href="https://github.com/jarmitage/Stenophone/">Stenophone</a> made from a court transcription device, a <a href="https://penelope.hypotheses.org/1780">live-codable loom</a> based on ancient weaving technology, and experiments in punk genres such as riot grrrl remixed with live codeable machine listening tools.</p>
<p>This workshop aims to bring together current thinking on how live coding techniques can be combined with other algorithmic practices, and augmented and hybridised with gestural and physical interfaces. A feature of this research is humility, as researchers realise that relatively young computer science innovations have everything to learn from physical interface designs, which have developed through practice over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. This online workshop explores these themes through discussion and exploration of interfaces and practices.</p>
<p>This is a call for proposals for short demos, talks and other interventions exploring hybrid live coding interfaces in performance and craft. Proposals could present:</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:1em;color:#555555;font-style:italic"><p>We language nerds have a tendency to fetishize minimalism. Personally, I think simplicity is only part of the equation. What we really want to give the user is&nbsp;<em>power</em>, which I define as:</p>
<p><code>power = breadth × ease ÷ complexity</code></p>
<p>None of these are precise numeric measures. I’m using math as analogy here, not actual quantification.</p>
<p><em>Breadth</em>&nbsp;is the range of different things the language lets you express. C has a lot of breadth—it’s been used for everything from operating systems to user applications to games. Domain-specific languages like AppleScript and Matlab have less breadth.</p>
<p><em>Ease</em>&nbsp;is how little effort it takes to make the language do what you want. “Usability” might be another term, though it carries more baggage than I want to bring in. “Higher-level” languages tend to have more ease than lower-level ones. Most languages have a “grain” to them where some things feel easier to express than others.</p>
<p><em>Complexity</em>&nbsp;is how big the language is (and its runtime, core libraries, tools, ecosystem, etc.). People talk about how many pages are in a language’s spec, or how many keywords it has. It’s how much the user has to load into their wetware before they can be productive in the system. It is the antonym of simplicity.</p>
<p>Reducing complexity&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;increase power. The smaller the denominator, the larger the resulting value, so our intuition that simplicity is good is valid. However, when reducing complexity, we must take care not to sacrifice breadth or ease in the process, or the total power may go down. Java would be a strictly&nbsp;<em>simpler</em>&nbsp;language if it removed strings, but it probably wouldn’t handle text manipulation tasks well, nor would it be as easy to get things done.</p>
<p>The art, then is finding&nbsp;<em>accidental</em>&nbsp;complexity that can be omitted. Language features and interactions that don’t carry their weight by increasing the breadth or ease of using the language.</p>

The reality is that you have to make compromises based on engineering tradeoffs and on the goals of your language. Maximizing breadth results in a swiss army knife; it doesn't result in the best possible tool for all possible situations. That's why we have DSLs. The power equation also asks you to increase ease and reduce complexity. In reality, you can only increase ease and decrease complexity relative to some context, and a DSL provides this context. So what I'm saying
is that there is a tradeoff between breadth and the other desired qualities.</p>

He’s just trying to explain some
design choices he made in that chapter. I have taken this out of context just because I hoped it would make some of you interested in the other stuff he has to say around that tiny paragraph, but I can see how it’s a little misleading. </p>
<p>The goal of the book is teaching people how to craft a programming language and not to create the best possible language. A lot of the choices he makes are to keep it simple and illustrate important concepts. I think he’s doing an excellent job throughout the book making people aware of all the big and small trade offs that go into the design of a language and I hope you don’t get the wrong impression from that tiny piece that I chose to present here.</p>
<p>That said, I do agree with your comment, <strong>Doug Moen</strong>, what I'm basically trying to say is don’t blame the author because there’s a lot of context missing and blame me instead. :-)</p>

My university thesis took the power equation as its starting point, and tried to show how to design the "one true programming language" (not in those exact words) that had maximum expressive power. I no longer believe in this idea, so it was kind of exciting to see what I now consider to be a fundamental fallacy of language design expressed so bluntly and directly, as a simple equation.</p>

My thoughts about this have changed in the time since, though. Next year, it's something I want to get more info about, not to mention the fact that it signals, "This is related to a problem here and we care about solving it!"</p>
<p>Aside from gender, are there any diversity-oriented questions you wish had been asked? I have a pretty bad blind spot here, and it's something I want to improve.</p>

That could start with simply starting an open discussion here, and then having breakout discussions with those whose views and backgrounds aren’t well represented here. And then forming positive actions for the community as a whole. It wouldn’t be too much to do an additional diversity survey as an addendum to this rather than waiting a year. I would recommend to consult outside of this community to write such a survey. </p>
<p>Diversity means different things in different contexts. There is a wealth of diversity here in some dimensions, and a dearth in other dimensions, gender being the most obvious one. The issue also is a broader sociopolitical one: the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities and oppression across society. This community can either be an ally towards justice by working actively to dismantle that, or it can continue in its bubble implicitly excluding everyone else from the “future of coding” conversation, and ignorant of its own biases and weaknesses. </p>

We need a clear signal to the outside world that this is something we care about and want to improve. I'm excited to find many ways to send that signal.</p>
<p>With respect to consultation specifically, there are ways it can backfire — creating additional work for people who are already disadvantaged; implicitly asking individuals to act as representatives of a class. I want to do it, but I don't want to do it badly.</p>
<p>That's what made me uncomfortable to ask about gender. On one one hand, asking is a signal that it's something we care about and want to learn about. On the other hand, I've seen instances where the very people I'd like to reach are bothered by the tone-deaf way in which others have tried to reach them. To some, a survey question about gender might be seen as interest. To others, it might be seen as a gate.</p>
<p>I like the idea of a diversity survey. I'm going to spin up a conversation about that in <strong><code>#meta</code></strong>, so if you have thoughts on what that could look like I'd love to have your input.</p>

When I first took over, none of those conversations were happening here, and I was highly aware that some people would react with "ugh agenda" if I started making noise about it (edit: and I was looking for a way to start those conversations on a more constructive note). Now, we're having those conversations, and while some people are tipping their hand a bit in how they respond, I believe that the vast, vast majority of people here are interested in improving things and, like me, probably weren't sure how best to approach that before. We're still doing <em>activity</em>, and not making <em>progress</em>, but it's a start and I have no intention of letting the issue go.</p>

The deeper stuff can be coded inside plugins. The underlaying format can be a graph stored in json format which can be read and processed in a lot of languages. An advantage of a visual programming environment is also that it can serve as part of the documentation needed for a project</p>

So we gotta build it, because that is what the customers (i.e. new programmers) demand. There are about 100 million people learning to program now. Enormous competition going on to build the tools acceptable to this new generation.</p>

Although it has lots of visual helpers. For me visually programming is visually connecting nodes that represent plugins/variables or can call a "sub-flow" (a function in normal programming), but you still need code to wire it up and provide additional functionality depending on the application (if you write a webapp server flow this could be the connection with the webserver to handle http endpoints in the visual environment for example)</p>

That's reasonable as a goal for this particular page. (It's also why I find this page unsatisfying.) But it also seems reasonable for it to trigger conversations about the how. That doesn't feel like \"missing the point\". Isn't that sort of conversation what this page is designed to engender?\nYes, completely agreed. The mission page is trying to act as a list of ideals to aim for (and they aren't set in stone either, I'm sure they'll change and improve through feedback like this). It's great to see people talking about how they could be achieved, which goals are more important to them, etc.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it will help to triangulate by bringing up my mission: <http://akkartik.name/about>. Not to brag, but we're attacking highly overlapping if not isomorphic problems. By definition I should have addressed any shortcomings I bring up here. It stays high-level, focuses on goals, but also indicates the sorts of trade-offs I'm willing to make. I'd love to receive similar criticism from you about what it's lacking.\nI agree, there's a good amount of overlap between the malleable principles and your own mission. Seems like we should continue to chat and compare notes as our efforts evolve. :smile:\n\nAbout your own mission page, overall I think it's quite good! My initial comments are only about stylistic things like making section headers more visually distinct, since my ADHD-addled brain found it hard to scan. I think with a personal mission (like your page), where you're describing your personal vision, it makes sense to link goals, constraints, and solutions together like you have done.\n\nFor the malleable site, I'd like many different voices to contribute their own views, constraints, and solutions, so that's why I've been saying they make more sense to be separate elements from the list of ideals there: I expect there to be many different answers as different people get involved. For now, I'd like to at least collect such perspectives and encourage more discussion.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it would help to drill down into which comments you consider to be missing the point. It might require a private conversation, but it might help make this conversation more concrete.\nThere's a background level of startup-y noise in there, such as <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858840>, but I never read HN these days, so perhaps that's actually a low amount of such things for the site. :sweat_smile:\n\nI agree there's useful feedback in there as well. :smile: Thanks for picking out those various threads and summarising the sentiment. I agree with your take on the ones you selected. I'll add them to my list of feedback to sift through for the future.",

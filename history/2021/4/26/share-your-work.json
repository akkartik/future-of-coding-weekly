It's my own personal FoC project, and I'll be using this new podcast to explore the design of it in great depth. The podcast is inspired by early episodes of the Future of Coding podcast, in which Steve recapped his research with a style that felt to me a little like _daydreaming_. I enjoyed those episodes very much, and have wanted to do something similar ever since I took over Steve's show. I've come up with my own twist on the format that should make it even more enjoyable and useful. Episodes will be brief, frequent, and light. There are already 6 episodes in the feed, so that you can try it out for a bit to see if you enjoy it before deciding to subscribe on an ongoing basis. The primary audience is... myself \u2014 this is an audio sketchbook. But I think some of you will find it interesting too.\n\nFor a slightly longer writeup about the podcast: <https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/>\n\nTo subscribe,\n\u2022 use this hand-crafted RSS feed: <https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss>\n\u2022 search for\u00a0*Hest*\u00a0or\u00a0*Ivan Reese*\u00a0in your podcast player of choice,\n\u2022 or click one of the buttons here:\u00a0<https://pod.link/1559446316>\nThis might not appeal to many people, but for those to whom it does, I sincerely hope you enjoy it.",

The \"cool kids\" zeitgeist seems to be going the other direction (e.g. Ink&amp;Switch), both for privacy and performance reasons. I recently moved house and go better internet (70mbps) and tried out Stadia and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and the performance still isn't there IMO, the ping is very noticeable. Maybe once cloud compute infrastructure is common in every town, like a post office. If you live next to an AWS datacentre, then yeah I'm sure the calculus is very different.",

The \"cool kids\" zeitgeist seems to be going the other direction (e.g. Ink&Switch), both for privacy and performance reasons. I recently moved house and go better internet (70mbps) and tried out Stadia and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and the performance still isn't there IMO, the ping is very noticeable. Maybe once cloud compute infrastructure is common in every town, like a post office. If you live next to an AWS datacentre, then yeah I'm sure the calculus is very different."

Both are experimental programming environments with their own bespoke languages, focussed on learnability and visualization. In the case of Code Lauren, we also see another theme of Mary's work \u2014 taking the largely invisible processing done by compilers / interpreters and making it visible and interactive. Mary also made a totally awful game that I hate so much, but to find out what that is you'll just have to listen to the show (or read the largely unedited transcript \u2014 again, sorry Jack).",

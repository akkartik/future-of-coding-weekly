It was the emphasis that systems should not have synthetic barriers of understandability, i.e. barriers that are completely irrelevant and outside of the environment itself. Just think of how much you have to learn in order to add a button to your OS _desktop_ to display or make so many of the even trivial changes. There is no path from A-&gt;B which does require you to learn new programming languages, paradigms, etc etc\n      It is as if to write down your thought you needed to  go and study stone carving/chiseling for 3 years\u2026 This is exactly the sort of thing the LRG wanted to avoid. And I would argue that this is  the case for Smalltalk, but whether the way things are organized or the metaphor used for this organization is good, i.e. evocative, is a different conversation.\n     And one we should be having! - one of the reasons to make more authorship environments! This is what Alan Kay wanted/thought was going to happen. He even insisted that they burn all the disks and start over in ~\u201978 but that was vetoed by the group.\n\nSmalltalk was an engine for thinking about how computing could be in the future. It was not intended to be the engine of computing. Simpletalk goes along the same direction. It is a conversation starter not an end-all. That in no way takes away from what it should be able to do - it should be the real thing.\n\nPapert said that \u201cin order to think about thinking you need to think about thinking about something.\u201d\n\n_In order to author an authorship environment you need to author the authoring of something_. Awkward but you get the point\u2026\n\nAnd yes as you intuited our starting point was to build a system from the ground up. But we counted on an initial 3-6 months of funding, and going \u2018from the bare metal\u2019 to something like this with three people in that time is not realistic. Moreover we wanted to ask slightly different questions as step one, those which were beyond specificities of implementation, hardware and all that.\n\nSo thank you for comments! They are exactly inline with what I hope will generate the sort of thinking about such environments and computing as a whole.",

And I would argue that this is  the case for Smalltalk, but whether the way things are organized or the metaphor used for this organization is good, i.e. evocative, is a different conversation.\n     And one we should be having! - one of the reasons to make more authorship environments! This is what Alan Kay wanted/thought was going to happen. He even insisted that they burn all the disks and start over in ~\u201978 but that was vetoed by the group.\n\nSmalltalk was an engine for thinking about how computing could be in the future. It was not intended to be the engine of computing. Simpletalk goes along the same direction. It is a conversation starter not an end-all. That in no way takes away from what it should be able to do - it should be the real thing.\n\nPapert said that \u201cin order to think about thinking you need to think about thinking about something.\u201d\n\n"

Moreover we wanted to ask slightly different questions as step one, those which were beyond specificities of implementation, hardware and all that.\n\nSo thank you for comments!

Back in the early days, each motherboard contained a little snippet of Clojure code but I noticed that a lot of them were simple if/them clauses and when they weren't you could simplify them to be so by making the other logic physical, if you know what I mean? For instance instead of writing code to detect a recent button press in the Simon game by having a Clojure variable to keep track of the last time a button was pressed, I just created a physical thingamajig that is in a certain state for a while after each button press. So if each motherboard can just be simple if/then statements with or/and/not conditions, then it can be represented by a simple graph. Even things I thought couldn't be simplified this way like a while loop turned out to be possible, the \"player\" circuit is a physical while loop for instance.",

                                "text": "\u00a0Thanks, I'm often surprised by how powerful the motherboard programming is (the logic panel as you call it), that was kind of an accident. Back in the early days, each motherboard contained a little snippet of Clojure code but I noticed that a lot of them were simple if/them clauses and when they weren't you could simplify them to be so by making the other logic physical, if you know what I mean? For instance instead of writing code to detect a recent button press in the Simon game by having a Clojure variable to keep track of the last time a button was pressed, I just created a physical thingamajig that is in a certain state for a while after each button press. So if each motherboard can just be simple if/then statements with or/and/not conditions, then it can be represented by a simple graph. Even things I thought couldn't be simplified this way like a while loop turned out to be possible, the \"player\" circuit is a physical while loop for instance."

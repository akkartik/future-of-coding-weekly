Inspired by the idea of 'complementary science', this essay recovers interesting ideas from how programming used to be done using Commodore 64 BASIC. Reading about interactions is not enough and so this interactive essay lets you build a small Breakout game using a simple Commodore 64 BASIC simulator.",

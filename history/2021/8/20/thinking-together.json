I was looking everywhere for a particular version of 3-SAT algo that I am thinking of (although it is not totally done in my mind) and I would like to understand what am I missing (or not seeing rather) because it does seem to me that there is a nice (i guess) polynomial time (I hope) algo to deal with 3-SAT. Now 3-SAT being NP Complete and the fact that all NP-Complete problems can be reduced to 3-SAT in polynomial time, I am certainly off somewhere. The problem is, I can't figure out where.

Probably my favorite so far has been <https://anvil.works/> but even that was rejected. The most impressive was bubble. I will evaluate <https://docs.budibase.com/>, <https://enso.org/> over the weekend\n\nHere are my gripes with the tools\n\n1. JSON exports / Unreadable code generation - This just kills most solutions for me. For this reason I would much rather use tools like tailwind designer that generate readable Html5 code. Looking at you webflow.\n2. Cloud Only - If the trend of cloud goes on any longer I will be calling all offline apps and command line tools lightning apps. Pure offline support is important. Self hosting is important. I love node-red in this regard.\n3. Intimidating examples - My use case is simple. Most examples and documentation provide complex use cases. When learning programming in the text driven world, we start with \u201cHello World\u201d, simple iteration, repl, libraries and shell scripts. Not only are these easy and fast to type, you can copy paste stuff to get things working. Copy paste is a killer feature of the text driven world.\n4. Tie in with frameworks and using the browser for editing code - This introduces too much dependency and breaks my existing way of working.\n5. Can\u2019t re-use the components in existing projects - I think these platforms need to provide an api or hooks so that they are reusable in normal scripts. Perhaps 90% of the app can be designed in the browser but 10% can be done in the traditional way.\n\nHere are some good enough and free solutions - stencil, mongodb, python scripting, wordpress, webkit shell for mobile apps, tailwind designer for UI. For a team &lt; 10, these solutions are workable with email and all of them are free. These solutions are simple. Perhaps no code is doing too many things at once ?",

I love node-red in this regard.\n3. Intimidating examples - My use case is simple. Most examples and documentation provide complex use cases. When learning programming in the text driven world, we start with \u201cHello World\u201d, simple iteration, repl, libraries and shell scripts. Not only are these easy and fast to type, you can copy paste stuff to get things working. Copy paste is a killer feature of the text driven world.\n4. Tie in with frameworks and using the browser for editing code - This introduces too much dependency and breaks my existing way of working.\n5. Can\u2019t re-use the components in existing projects - I think these platforms need to provide an api or hooks so that they are reusable in normal scripts. Perhaps 90% of the app can be designed in the browser but 10% can be done in the traditional way.\n\nHere are some good enough and free solutions - stencil, mongodb, python scripting, wordpress, webkit shell for mobile apps, tailwind designer for UI. For a team < 10, these solutions are workable with email and all of them are free. These solutions are simple. Perhaps no code is doing too many things at once ?"

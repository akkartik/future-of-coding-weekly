        "text": "I think web3 is actually a bunch of things, some of which are more likely to succeed than others. E.g. the idea of using private keys for authentication/authorization is obviously better if you can get over the UX hump (go go SSH!).\n\nIf we remove all the hyperbole from it, the best explanation I've heard so far is that web3 is a protocol/architecture for near-trustless* commitments. That doesn't sound like much, but commitments underlie virtually all of modern society, which I think is why the rhetoric around the space gets so crazy.\n\nSome examples:\n1. How does someone know you are who you say you are? The government issues you a number of some kind, it makes a commitment that you are unique and this number identifies you.\n2. How do you prove you own a house? The government issues you a deed declaring that some parcel of land and whatever is on it is yours. The government reifies this commitment as a copy of the deed stored in public records.\n3. How do you prove you have the money to buy something? You either physically possess fiat currency, or you have a bank account, with a number that is unique to you and contains your balance. The commitment of that balance is upheld only by the bank itself.\nIn each of these scenarios the commitments are upheld only by authority. I am the government and you trust me, so you'll believe that this number is this person or this house belongs to them. I am the bank and you will believe that you have $100, because I say so. With something like the ethereum blockchain, you can accomplish the same kinds of commitments, but without needing to trust some third party to continue to uphold their side of the deal.\n\nRemoving the need to trust the other party allows for things that weren't previously reasonable. For example, let's say you want to fix up your local neighborhood's park. You have the time, but doing so will take a few thousand dollars in supplies. You could go to your neighbors and try to raise the money from them, but that requires them to trust you with whatever donations they give. 40 years ago in the US, that probably would've worked, but these days, trust is in pretty low supply and I suspect you would have a very difficult time convincing folks. Trust-less commitments, however, give us a different way forward. You can specify the amount needed and contractually state what is allowed to be done with it as well as contingencies for if the obligations aren't met. Once submitted, that contract will be carried out exactly as specified, it is observable to all, debuggable, and non-falsifiable*. So as a community we could come together, raise $2k, require that the person who is going to purchase the physical supplies also puts in 2k as collateral in the event that the community votes that the funds were misused and now no one needs to really trust each other. If enough money isn't raised, everyone gets their money back. If you tried to make off with the 2k, you just lost the 2k you put up yourself, so it's a wash.\n\nIn this scenario, we talked about a local community because it's much more reasonable to imagine giving someone you know a donation. But if you put this on the internet, these sort of trust-less commitments could spring up for all sorts of things. From \"investing\" in the community of projects like Hest to large scale collective action like improving an entire city's parks.\n\nIn principle a system that can make commitments without the need for authority could underly most forms of ownership and commerce. It also allows you to create systems of economic incentives that would otherwise require you to trust that individuals never change their mind or become bad - which has historically been a very bad bet.\n\nWe'll have to see if it pans out, but at least in theory, the concepts behind web3 could provide a very different foundation for society, one where guarantees don't have to be backed by people with guns (aka governments), but instead a series of transactions on an immutable ledger backed by cryptographic math that can be automated, observed, and trusted.\n\n(*) nearly trustless because you have to believe that the network has not had a 51% attack and that the system and contracts are without bugs. Given the size of these networks and their history, by far the greatest risk are the contracts themselves, but just like there's standard contract legalese, I suspect standard, verified contracts would become the norm and you'd just be putting them together. I believe in practice, it is far more trustless than any other extent system.",

Once CryptoKitties appeared, we thought this was all going to go too weird for our buttoned-down tastes.\n\nNow over Thanksgiving I have my sister asking me, \"So I was on TikTok, and what is an NFT?\"  \"A scam,\" I said.  For now, that's my honest answer to a first approximation.\n\nI'll change my mind when those gun toters recognize deeds and paperwork by consulting the blockchain.  I'm most interested in boring administrative work: auditing, supply chains, compliance, logistics, paper pushing.  Complaints about mining costs fall on deaf ears when we already build whole cities more or less dedicated to the same task.\n\nFor me, if web3 ends up being anything, I certainly hope it ends up with more web1ish interoperability rather than the web2ish walled gardens."

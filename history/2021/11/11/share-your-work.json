I wrote about this a bit in an article called <https://jessmart.in/articles/copilot|Copilot and Conversational Programming.>\n\nContext: I've been programming with Copilot for a few months now, so the code generation wasn't super surprising. I've also done a bunch of work in VR, so more or less familiar with the interfaces, headsets, etc.\n\nIn other words, I totally love this stuff. :heart:\n\nThat being said, some feedback on the video:\n\u2022 It was definitely hard to watch from your view due to the head bobbing. I know that's not distracting to you when you're in VR, but this is exactly why GoPro and others added gimbals and such to make those videos watchable.\n\u2022 I was most curious about the annotations of the code, and was constantly trying to figure out what they represented. Wish you'd explained those more.\n\u2022 I love how you represented the environment as basically having no \"floor\" - infinite up and down, with a \"horizon line\" to keep things centered. Also, that subtle code-like background texture was :ok_hand: .\n\u2022 I was surprised y'all didn't move about or \"use the space\" a little more. I would think of writing programs in VR as writing on those giant sticky note pads. Once you fill one up, you \"tear it off\" and \"stick it to the wall\" somewhere out of the way.\n\u2022 Minor thing, but the 3d positional audio (I think) was nice, but your coding partner was a big muffled and it made him feel non-responsive. I would expect a better demo to have more back-n-forth conversation and be a bit more \"lively.\"\nJust my two cents! Please post any other videos/thoughts you have on this, it's awesome to see!",

I had thought \"unlisted\" would just allow the episode to be streamed if you had a link, but it _also_ sent the episode out to all subscribers. So.. that sort of blew our cover.\n\nKartik has very kindly, very masochistically, very kindly offered to take a crack at cleaning up the transcript, since that's something I used to do that I'm <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/CEXED56UR/p1612408693044100|not> going to be doing in the future.\n\nSo yeah, I was just giving him a bit of time to do that before posting an announcement. At the same time, I figured _someone_ would probably say something. So it was just a matter of time. No sweat!\n\nThanks for the kind words. To be honest, listening back to it a year after the fact (this interview was recorded in Jan 2020), I keep thinking \"How the fuck did I come up with such good questions? This doesn't feel like me.\" So.. chances are good that I blow it on the next one, but it was a good run while it lasted :P\n\n&lt;3",

But there is something about the demo above that triggers me.\n\nThe demo above looks like pure theater to me. Oh, you can sort these images by color in a fancy moving animation? Why? And when he calls his colleagues on stage and they do\u2026 what\u2026 exactly? His hand movements are overly expressive, more than they need to be, even for 2010 technology. (Which is important for what Tom Cruise does in the movie! It would be boring to watch otherwise.) That looks like theater to me.

As someone else in the conversation pointed out, many would consider a bit of stagecraft an improvement after a day of presenters mumbling through dry presentations featuring illegible slides. I think it's important to keep in mind that different audiences need to hear things said in different ways, and that what seems like hollow showmanship to you might be exactly what inspiration looks like for someone else.\n\nSo, with that in mind, perhaps this video featuring smaller gestures and a wand interface might be more to your taste. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n<https://vimeo.com/174223351>",

As someone else in the conversation pointed out, many would consider a bit of stagecraft an improvement after a day of presenters mumbling through dry presentations featuring illegible slides. I think it's important to keep in mind that different audiences need to hear things said in different ways, and that what seems like hollow showmanship to you might be exactly what inspiration looks like for someone else.\n\nSo, with that in mind, perhaps this video featuring smaller gestures and a wand interface might be more to your taste.

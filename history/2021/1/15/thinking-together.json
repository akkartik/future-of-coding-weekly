I'm not sure if this is a novel insight or not, but there seems to be some form of equivalence between reading/writing code textually vs with blocks/shapes and the equivalence of algebra/geometry.\nThere are many proofs and problems that seem to lend themselves to geometry over algebra but there are also situations that being able to reason about something algebraically makes it substantially simpler. I think this is the situation where you need both and it's possible at certain levels of abstraction you would want to be able to easily shift back and forth. For example I could imagine a system that had components built in a textual representation but then the component linking all done utilizing shapes.",

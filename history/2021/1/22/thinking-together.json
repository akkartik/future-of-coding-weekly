The tangibility is important here, but using physical objects can also reduce the scope of what code has to do. For example, your code becomes simpler if you don\u2019t have to worry about fitting modals, tabs, and substates into a single screen if you can separate them across many papers/programs.

The tangibility is important here, but using physical objects can also reduce the scope of what code has to do. For example, your code becomes simpler if you don\u2019t have to worry about fitting modals, tabs, and substates into a single screen if you can separate them across many papers/programs. This also includes using the spatial relation of programs to influence control flow."

Most of my disappointment was with implementation, which is maybe the wrong thing to critique in a research environment, but it's still something that matters.  Specifically the overall latency of the system was disappointing, it was challenging to code or interact with any programs that felt immediate.  When I was there they said latency would be addressed, but it's also a hard problem given the implementation of the system.  The other thing I didn't like so much was that claim\\wish\\when system wasn't well utilized in most of the tables they had in the space.  That is, usually a single page or two felt like a self contained application, and the dream of a loosely coupled dynamic play space that required little coding to compose interesting and useful behaviors wasn't realized.  There's no reason I could see that they couldn't support it, and some of the debugging tools gave a glimpse of that, but it was really hard to pick up a random page from one table, bring it across that space and have it do something interesting (or at all) with other pages.  Designing a semi-shared set of common claims (outside of system level ones to access lower level drawing, audio, etc. functionality) would have made it more interesting I think.\n\nMy favorite demos were things that worked around these limitations and also showed something that would be tedious to do outside of the environment.  Like the demo where you could draw multiple sketches and have them automatically animated on another page.  Latency didn't matter, because you got much more immediate feedback than if you did this with a camera or a scanner in a traditional computing environment.  Another one I liked was a simple book (like the equivalent of a CD album booklet) where you could turn the page and play different songs, with text with the song and artist name. In some ways the projector system might be a good visual equivalent to an audio home assistant (Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.)  I really wanted to see more, here are a bunch of building block pages, compose them however you like.  I think back to Nicky Cases concept for visual programming (below) in Dynamicland, and although I don't think I just want that, the actual act of programming in dynamicland was writing lua scripts on an extremely text laggy editor, with poor error\\compile feedback, and I would have liked to build things with the same ease and in the same natural way as interacting with some of the demos",

Most of my disappointment was with implementation, which is maybe the wrong thing to critique in a research environment, but it's still something that matters.  Specifically the overall latency of the system was disappointing, it was challenging to code or interact with any programs that felt immediate.  When I was there they said latency would be addressed, but it's also a hard problem given the implementation of the system.  The other thing I didn't like so much was that claim\\wish\\when system wasn't well utilized in most of the tables they had in the space.  That is, usually a single page or two felt like a self contained application, and the dream of a loosely coupled dynamic play space that required little coding to compose interesting and useful behaviors wasn't realized.  There's no reason I could see that they couldn't support it, and some of the debugging tools gave a glimpse of that, but it was really hard to pick up a random page from one table, bring it across that space and have it do something interesting (or at all) with other pages.  Designing a semi-shared set of common claims (outside of system level ones to access lower level drawing, audio, etc. functionality) would have made it more interesting I think.\n\nMy favorite demos were things that worked around these limitations and also showed something that would be tedious to do outside of the environment.  Like the demo where you could draw multiple sketches and have them automatically animated on another page.  Latency didn't matter, because you got much more immediate feedback than if you did this with a camera or a scanner in a traditional computing environment.  Another one I liked was a simple book (like the equivalent of a CD album booklet) where you could turn the page and play different songs, with text with the song and artist name. In some ways the projector system might be a good visual equivalent to an audio home assistant (Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.)  I really wanted to see more, here are a bunch of building block pages, compose them however you like.  I think back to Nicky Cases concept for visual programming (below) in Dynamicland, and although I don't think I just want that, the actual act of programming in dynamicland was writing lua scripts on an extremely text laggy editor, with poor error\\compile feedback, and I would have liked to build things with the same ease and in the same natural way as interacting with some of the demos"

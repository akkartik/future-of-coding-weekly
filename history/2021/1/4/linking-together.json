The \"pre-1996\" list includes LISP - a language from 1958! If we are allowed to reach 40 odd years in the past, then a lot of the 1996 list can be included in a 2020 list. It also oddly _excludes_ C++ from the description; _\"useful incremental improvements on top of the foundational technologies that came before\"_, despite it's name being a literal pun on incrementally improving C.\n\nThe second article, I don't really follow what type of organisation is expected to be producing groundbreaking research. Small software houses making UI widgets? From my understanding, most significant steps forward have come from monopolies, academia, or military. (this is where most of the 1996 list items came out of).

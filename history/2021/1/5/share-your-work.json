Your ethos of \"no-code isn't powerful enough\" and \"you still have to think like a developer\" come through and resonate. Your value prop of eliminating boilerplate is clear. I had a strong feeling it was Rails behind the scenes before you said so. The first idea I wanted to steal was your auto-generated custom API docs. Very nice. My reaction to \"Twilio and SendGrid connections with more coming\" was: consider <http://autocode.com|autocode.com> instead of recreating all those connectors. As a developer, Gadget's design aesthetic feels fun, but my impression as potential customer of Gadget is: this isn't \"serious\" enough and feels like a toy. A font change could make the stuffed shirts be more comfortable with it. I asked myself fairly early on: why (other than Gadget's business model) is this a hosted service? It seems like 90% of the value is created in the initial app creation with a lower value prop in the ongoing maintenance, all-the-while feeling locked in. Why can't this be a code-generating wizard that I then take away to host and maintain myself? What's the benefit to me of keeping the project in Gadget long term? Finally, the demo itself shows the construction of an app that actually could be built well in a tool like <http://retool.com|retool.com> or something where the kind of customization you allow isn't necessary. It seems like a more compelling demo would include customization that less flexible tools wouldn't allow. (I know it's a lot to pack into 10 minutes :slightly_smiling_face:). I'm inspired by the innovative work you're doing and wish you lots of success. Cheers!",

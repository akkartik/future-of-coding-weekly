If you enable authentication with LinkedIn's 3-legged flow (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?tabs=HTTPS>), then you can use the Connections API with Field Request to return the connection names and unique IDs/urns (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/connections-api>) for all of your connections.  With that, you have a first-connections social graph.  And then, just need a way to send message blobs to those folks!\n\nHere's a repo where I've been working on it:\n\n<https://github.com/sbutler-gh/earthkind>\n\n^ At the moment, it's stuck because the LinkedIn 3-legged auth isn't working \u2014 not sure exactly what the problem is, whether CORS or with the redirect URIs.  I added documentation in the `index.svelte` file to describe more there.\n\nIf it is CORS errors, I'm not sure if that's bypassable locally, so I also spun up a deployed instance at <https://earthkind.pages.dev/>.  That gives some redirect errors when trying to authenticate which might provide more information.\n\nI've been reflecting on this for awhile, think it could be really useful!  For example, do you ever have an in-depth DM chat with a friend where you wish other people could check out the discussion/thoughts coming out?

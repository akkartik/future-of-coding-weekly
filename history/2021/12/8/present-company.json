For the last one year I have been working in Robocorp as a Senior Software Engineer. I was leading the AI / ML part. I have built the entire training, ops and related parts their. Here are two interesting projects I had worked on there\n\n1.&gt; Identifying and classifying UI elements from a screen shot- I started with a single line of brief. I created the detail problem statement, defined the methodologies, oversaw the data gathering process, trained, tested and debugged classical and deep learning based algorithms, I managed to out-perform the most advanced algorithm publicly available in this domain, and finally I integrated this in the main product as a PoC.

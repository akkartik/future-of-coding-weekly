That would be where most of the meat is, and maybe I've been assuming that those will serve as examples that clarify the very abstract parts. So I'm reluctant to make this part longer. Maybe one of those side-by-side formats would be good with examples and explanations off to the right?\n\nWith what I've given you, maybe it's enough that people aren't actively confused on what I'm even saying. Like I said up front, this is primarily an exercise in whether I can convey the ideas at all. I've historically had trouble putting them into words at all. I know it's a little weird using this slack as basically a writing critique group, by that's where I am right now. :) \n\nI almost posted, and still might, an even more abstract question about what even _can_ serve as justification for, e.g., one set of data modeling primitives over another.",

That would be where most of the meat is, and maybe I've been assuming that those will serve as examples that clarify the very abstract parts. So I'm reluctant to make this part longer. Maybe one of those side-by-side formats would be good with examples and explanations off to the right?\n\nWith what I've given you, maybe it's enough that people aren't actively confused on what I'm even saying. Like I said up front, this is primarily an exercise in whether I can convey the ideas at all. I've historically had trouble putting them into words at all. I know it's a little weird using this slack as basically a writing critique group, by that's where I am right now. :) \n\nI almost posted, and still might, an even more abstract question about what even "

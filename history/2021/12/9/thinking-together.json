Do you think a brief summary and a link to a blog post w code examples would be more helpful? Anyways, what I mean with `state`is just a tree of pure values, like in `statecharts` , and, yes the embodiment can be DOM, concrete UI etc. In stead of Layer machine, just read `state machine` or `statechart` and assume a composable version of them that covers the whole app instead of leaving a lot to the host language. And in stead of _layer machine markup_, think HTML, just extended with some new kinds of tags or metatags. I think _explicit state modeling_ as in e.g. statecharts is so great for keeping complexity at bay, and that the biggest thing stopping it from being even more useful is _composability_; thus I find anything that might enhance composability of statecharts/state modeling super exciting!

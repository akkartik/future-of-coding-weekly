I've been working on a language for quickly sketching out app ideas/user flows, inspired by the concept of a \"software breadboard\" from Basecamp's Shape Up methodology (<https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding|https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding>): it's definitely not ready for prime time yet, but I think it's got the bones of a decently expressive rapid prototyping language. Feel free to play around with the demo at <https://breadboard.redefine.software|https://breadboard.redefine.software>. Source code is on GitHub: <http://github.com/redefinesoftware/breadboarder|http://github.com/redefinesoftware/breadboarder>. Curious to hear your feedback!",

I largely agree with the philosophy, but at the same time find some unease with it. \n\nI guess I want to have this conversation, but I also don't want to be super negative. \n\nClojure is a fantastic set of tradeoffs that makes for a super productive programming environment. But I do worry that there is a lot of talk from rich that this model of programming is the only good one. That is something I think needs more push back in the clojure world. \n\nI think languages have something to learn from clojure. But clojure could learn a lot from other languages as well."

The main complications are multi-methods (that require elaborate closure representation) and the fact that Alpha is JIT-compiled (so compilation units are smaller and are added dynamically). Not much code has been written this week, and there are zero features added, so I\u2019ll submit a book review and my musings about continuations as this week\u2019s report :grin:.",

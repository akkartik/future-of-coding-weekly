I\u2019ve already been experimenting with backend flows, where you can design a flow which has http endpoints and communicate with a the database.\nWhat I\u2019ve been doing today is compile a visual flow to webassembly, live in the browser :slightly_smiling_face: . I already wrote a litte webassembly compiler which runs in the browser, so all I had to do was parse a flow and generate the code that this compiler understands. It\u2019s offcourse still very early stage, and I hope to show some more soon (currently this flow-type only supports variables and expressions, but the compiler has already support for functions, while loops and very basic memory manipulation).\nOne of the things that I already noticed , is that I need is to be able to have vertical flows instead of just horizontal in the editor :blush:.\n\nAn image of the above can be seen in the attached thread\n\nI\u2019ll be back with a video soon!\nHave a good sunday!\nMaikel",

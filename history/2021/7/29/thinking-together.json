Just thought I'd throw out some ideas I've been mulling over to get some feedback on their plausibility.\n\nFirst: A controlled natural language (CNL) like Attempto Controlled English for precise documentation. I'd envision a sort of CI pipeline where updates to documentation trigger a series of tests, and if the documentation doesn't match the code its paired with then the tests would fail. In the other direction a CNL seems like a great starting point for program synthesis from a higher level of abstraction.\n\nSecond: A math chat bot teacher.  Given a math question and its answer, can a program deduce the conceptual error(s) that led to any wrong answer? So far I have a list of possible useful technologies: SAT/SMT solvers, Prolog, ASTs, Lean, Sympy in Python. I haven't put in much actual work yet, but order of operations questions seems like a good (or easy) place to start.\n\nAfter listening to an interview with Sal Khan of Khan Academy (on the 3b1b podcast) my pie in the sky idea is a chat bot that can help a student through the entire pre-k - 8th grade curriculum. Seems like a better idea than the one I had that expected kids to learn LaTeX.",

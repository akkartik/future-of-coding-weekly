Just like any other online code playground, but this one is extensible.\n\nRecipe:\n\n- 3 \u00d7 Code Editor\n- 1 \u00d7 HTML Renderer\n\nIn the video, I manually include the animation library \"anime.js\" into the website. An extension to this workspace would be another block that could be used to load external dependencies.\n\nWhat\u2019s included:\n\n- Programming using Blocks and Wires\n- Blocks as Objects: Cut, Copy, Paste, Rename\n- Organization with Tabbed Workspaces and Layouts\n- Data Fetching and Data Flow",

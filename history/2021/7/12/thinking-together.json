The idea is nodes would always have a single parent, and a fixed x/y position, and be connected to their parent by a tube, in which unlimited wires might be threaded. Messages between nodes would have to route according to these layouts (each node would have routing capability). To see the exact connections between nodes, you would likely have to hover over a node and it's relevant wired connections could highlight. Does the EE world have GUI tools that follow a paradigm like this?",

The idea is nodes would always have a single parent, and a fixed x/y position, and be connected to their parent by a tube, in which unlimited wires might be threaded. Messages between nodes would have to route according to these layouts (each node would have routing capability). To see the exact connections between nodes, you would likely have to hover over a node and it's relevant wired connections could highlight. Does the EE world have GUI tools that follow a paradigm like this?"

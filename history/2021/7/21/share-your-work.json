As an interviewer, your did a lot of preparation / research beforehand which enables a lot of questions that go deeper than usual. I think the interview was very honest und humane. It also gave insights into his thinking, more than just thought out solutions and also provided insights into other communities and tools that some of us might not be aware of. Thank you!"

I'm using my own <http://Nodes.io|Nodes.io> for development so i was able to modify and recompile parts of app live without taking the headset off. ..and then i never did it again due to connection issues, browser wanting to upgrade, blind keyboard typing being hard etc.\n\nThe cool thing is Pass Through support for apps is apparently coming to Oculus so you will be able to see your room (and keyboard). So while AR being 80% real and 20% virtual (full of tracking alignment problems), having VR+camera at 20% real and 80% virtual might be sweet spot!",

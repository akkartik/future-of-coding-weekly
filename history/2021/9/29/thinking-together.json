It is a huge topic, but I'll attempt (perhaps foolishly) a summarization.\n\nSociocracy is a framework for self-governance of a group of people. This could be anything from a book club with your friends to a large corporation. In my mind, the main pillars of sociocracy are: consent, circles, and feedback.\n\n1. *Consent*: sociocracy takes \"consent of the governed\" very seriously. Every decision of a sociocratic circle must be made with the consent of everyone that is a member of that circle. Lots of people think this is impossible, but I assure you it isn't. The key to making this work is to try to find a course of action that is within everyone's \"range of tolerance.\" That is, the decision doesn't have to be everyone's preference, they don't have to like it, they just have to be \"okay with it.\" Finding a solution within the area of \"I can live with it\" is a LOT easier than finding a solution that makes everyone happy. Indeed, the later is often impossible.\n2. *Circles*: a sociocratic circle is the fundamental unit of organization within sociocracy. A circle can optionally have one or more Child Circles, if the organization is large enough to warrant it. Each circle in sociocracy has an AIM (a reason for existing), a DOMAIN (area of authority), a TERM (how long it exists), and MEMBERS. A circle also has ROLES: 1) _Lead_: think \"project manager\" for the circle. Doesn't actually make the decisions (remember that is by consent of the members of that circle) but rather supports the circle so that it is still headed towards its AIM. 2) _Facilitator_: simply someone who ensures circle meetings run smoothly and are in service of the AIM. 3) _Secretary_: the person tasked with \"making sense\" of the circle's activities, recording minutes, logging decisions, etc. and 4) _Delegate_: see below.\n3. *Feedback*: The Delegate is the circle member tasked with pairing with the Lead to ensure the free flow of information from a Child Circle to a Parent Circle by virtue of being members of both circles. With this free flow of information and consent from \"top\" to \"bottom\" an organization becomes very aware of how well things are working at all \"levels\". Paring this with circle (and policy, and role) TERMS, sociocracy enables a dynamic, self-healing, and fluid structure of self-governance.\nIf you'd like to learn more about sociocracy, I highly recommend \"Many Voices, One Song\" by Ted Rau and Jerry Koch-Gonzalez <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/> And I can give a talk about it, if folks are interested.

        "text": "<@UJBAJNFLK> so the difficult thing about sociocracy is the wonderful thing about sociocracy, and that is: everyone has a say, everyone has a voice. Consent. What this means in terms of limits and where it breaks down, is that the members of a circle must be willing to engage in civil discourse. They must be able to express themselves freely, openly, and with vulnerability. Holding back a frustration or anxiety because you don't want to \"rock the boat\" will cause problems down the line. Everyone in a circle needs to be able to bring themselves fully into that space. Something that is highly recommended in sociocratic literature is something called NVC or nonviolent communication. It is a toolbox for supporting open and honest communication with minimal conflict. The de-facto \"texbook\" on NVC is appropriately titled \"Nonviolent Communication\" by Marshall Rosenberg.\n\nFor the question of expertise, it essentially boils down to, as usual: \"are we okay with it?\" If the members of the circle don't understand the impact of the decision they are making, then the expert needs to make them understand. Not the details, per se, but the impact. No one should be pressured into accepting a decision that they don't understand. Alternatively, highly technical decisions could also be delegated to a child circle. If the members of the parent circle consent to the creation of a child circle that makes highly technical decisions without their direct involvement, that is perfectly valid as well. Since 2 members of the child circle are also members of the parent circle, there should be regular reporting of its activities, and since consent flows both ways, there should be solid information flow (feedback) such that the parent AIM is still the guiding star.\n\n<@U027P92A0N5> the speed of decision-making is a fascinating story from my experience. If sociocracy is a new thing for the group, then decision-making does take longer initially. There is a learning period. However, once the group really understands and puts into practice the philosophy of \"good enough for now, safe enough to try\" and really adhere to the idea of \"I can live with it\" rather than demanding their preference, then decision-making (and meetings) amazingly gets shorter! And yes, larger circles (20 or more) do indeed take a long time, so if a group is huge, the first order of business is for that large group to consent to the creation of an array of child circles to delegate some of the authority and responsibility to.

What this means in terms of limits and where it breaks down, is that the members of a circle must be willing to engage in civil discourse. They must be able to express themselves freely, openly, and with vulnerability. Holding back a frustration or anxiety because you don't want to \"rock the boat\" will cause problems down the line. Everyone in a circle needs to be able to bring themselves fully into that space. Something that is highly recommended in sociocratic literature is something called NVC or nonviolent communication. It is a toolbox for supporting open and honest communication with minimal conflict. The de-facto \"texbook\" on NVC is appropriately titled \"Nonviolent Communication\" by Marshall Rosenberg.\n\nFor the question of expertise, it essentially boils down to, as usual: \"are we okay with it?\" If the members of the circle don't understand the impact of the decision they are making, then the expert needs to make them understand. Not the details, per se, but the impact. No one should be pressured into accepting a decision that they don't understand. Alternatively, highly technical decisions could also be delegated to a child circle. If the members of the parent circle consent to the creation of a child circle that makes highly technical decisions without their direct involvement, that is perfectly valid as well. Since 2 members of the child circle are also members of the parent circle, there should be regular reporting of its activities, and since consent flows both ways, there should be solid information flow (feedback) such that the parent AIM is still the guiding star.\n\n"

Would we put out a call like \"If you'd like to participate in the renaming of the community, please let me know and we'll form a circle to do so\"? And then the circle would get together, select an AIM, and then proceed from there? (Apologies if this is already well explained in the above thread, which I've been following but it usually takes me a few passes over a subject before it sticks)."

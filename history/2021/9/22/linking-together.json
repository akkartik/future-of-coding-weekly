CodeScene has an onboarding, which I did, but then there's a long wait until you get your first results. And then the results include build artifacts and libs, which are instant to exclude with the GH one, but a bit harder to figure out with CodeScene. I've now updated the configs, and am waiting to run the jobs again. Anyway, it does look promising, and excited to see the results, just a bigger learning curve with slower feedback times when using the app.",

However, before you tackle the scale, I suggest to consider tackling a small scope. For example, focus on a single message. Can you trace that through the system? If not, you might want to change the system to ensure you can - perhaps logging. Once you have that information, you will find that it\u2019s much easier to aggregate it across multiple queues.\n\nYou might also find that it\u2019s cheaper to create a tool that works for you than to adapt to a generic tool that might not fit, regardless of how fancy the look and feel is. A tool is most effective when it allows you to (in)validate your hypothesis."

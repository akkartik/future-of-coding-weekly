        "text": "Ok here goes a 'diversity' thread! I ran a session on the weekend that was like a kind of reverse beginners' workshop. We talked about what it was like engaging with tidalcycles as a community as a beginner, trying to teach me how to improve things. It echoed a discussion I took part in with early career Black artists as part of a programme called 'algoafrofutures' - I learned there are huge hidden barriers to participation in the form of hidden hierarchies and norms that repel most people ('most', given that white men are the minority). It seems that many just don't want to post their questions to a forum or especially engage with a live chat system because of bad past experiences and the general attitude of the \"men on the internet\" who hang out there. It seems people who experience racism, misogyny etc are there, but are lurking or not participating (shout out to the lurkers! would love to hear what you think but, well..). Similarly with local live coding workshops in Sheffield, women-only workshops will be full but then only men will show up to open workshops and mansplain things to the woman co-running the workshop. This is serious I think - communities that repel most people in ways they don't realise, and which totally undermines their aims to e.g. find a future of coding for everyone (in the case of this community), or do something similar by connecting computer programming with performing arts and wider culture (in the case of live coding).\nSo what can we do about it, besides solemn introspection? I really enjoyed Emma Dabiri's work which challenges the response to BLM, from an Irish and UK perspective. I recommend her short book 'what white people can do next' and most recent appearance on the blindboy podcast - best to check that out than rely on my summary.. But her thinking is based on solid academic understanding of the nature of race, and argues not for allyship (which only re-enforces power structures) but coalition. I think I'll stop there as I'm interested in what other people think 'coalition' could mean in this context..",

Ways in which groups can be separate yet  be totally co-operative are missing. When anthropologists go to a tribe, they don\u2019t force their views on them ... they operate in 3.\nTo take programming languages as an example ... I am arguing for single paradigm languages without forcing every language to accommodate every style. Python doesn\u2019t have types and that\u2019s OK. Every community has strengths and I fear tying to create a \u201ccommon community\u201d is a bad attempt to create 1 language that is forced on everyone for their own \u201cgood\u201d.  An organisation that uses multiple programming languages interacting via a common REST protocol is better than enforcing 1 language.

Ways in which groups can be separate yet  be totally co-operative are missing. When anthropologists go to a tribe, they don\u2019t force their views on them ... they operate in 3.\nTo take programming languages as an example ... I am arguing for single paradigm languages without forcing every language to accommodate every style. Python doesn\u2019t have types and that\u2019s OK. Every community has strengths and I fear tying to create a \u201ccommon community\u201d is a bad attempt to create 1 language that is forced on everyone for their own \u201cgood\u201d.  An organisation that uses multiple programming languages interacting via a common REST protocol is better than enforcing 1 language. While it looks inefficient, what I would like to point is that monocultures suck."

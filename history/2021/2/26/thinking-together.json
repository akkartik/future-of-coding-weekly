Like, where you're debugging a specific app and you spend a long time befuddled before realizing that your senses have been lying to you because of a bug in some app-specific view that you wrote. It was hiding some crucial bit of state, or it gets stuck in an infinite loop that hangs the whole system, and now you have to debug the debug system without being able to use the debug system.\n\nI wonder if this might be the reason people dislike debug-by-print as well. It is more powerful, but it forces everyone to wrestle with something typically considered the domain of systems programmers: the act of observing getting perturbed by the thing doing the observing.

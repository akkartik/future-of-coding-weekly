This is only my 2nd Electron project (the first being the rough prototypes for my FoC project, Hest), so I'm just now getting out of the early part of the learning curve. I'm at the point where I understand what it's like to work with Electron, and so I'm interested in looking at the other options \u2014\u00a0ideally, other options that people like _better_ than Electron \u2014 to see what those projects have decided to do differently, and to for the first time _feel_ that difference. I've looked at other options in the past (pretty much everything linked in this thread, as it turns out, so I guess the field is pretty small), but I wasn't able to really get much of a sense for each project beyond _this looks unsupported,_ or _the gaps in the docs are worrying_. But now that I know some of the not-obvious pains and joys of Electron, I was hoping that reflecting on alternatives would help me discover a few more not-obvious pains and joys.\n\nNo luck, but it was worth a shot!",

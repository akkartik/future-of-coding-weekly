Based on s-expression this time! And with communication with regular Scratch code using Scratch messages.\n\nHere are the <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mrjcj2Q2f3RH03x79cl4M1DKBQKG1znCb9oyMavhJZA/edit|documentation> and the <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/483823376/|Scratch project>.\n\nI really like this kind of weird experiments!

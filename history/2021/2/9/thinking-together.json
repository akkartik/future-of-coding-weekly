I think I'm frustrated by the conflict of the modern web building so much into individual documents rather than relying on pushing the structure into the links themselves. You're totally right that the web can be used in a way that makes it perfectly valid to strip out the presentational markup to quote something. But I think most of the web (or at least most of what people experience on the web) would be made unusable by this sort of transclusion.\n\n<@U01M3Q6JEG7> Thanks for the link! I hadn't heard of that as an area of study. It's interesting that you comment on the possibility of an all-encompassing structure because the main project I'm interested in is making a generic graph data structure usable as an application datastore. Which as soon as you have multiple overlapping schemas will immediately bring in concerns about maintaining different (potentially mutually inconsistent) ideas of consistency. I'll do some reading.\n\n<@U013ZLJARC7> That's good context. I have this sense that if we would have made browsers more powerful we could have avoided a lot of the js that gets written. An example I've been thinking about lately is authentication. Every website has its own login form, but browsers are (well, could be if digest auth were fully supported) totally capable of doing a login handshake with a server. Do you (or anybody) have thoughts on that?",

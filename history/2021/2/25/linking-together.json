I watched Emma's <https://doodybrains.github.io/the-mouse-holds-us/|last performance> (which was, in my impression, about _the mouse as an output device_, so to speak) and found it fascinating, so I'm really looking forward to this one.\n\nFor an early taste, take a look at Emma's site for the event: <https://complicatingthecomputermouse.net>\n\nHere's an excerpt of the description:\n&gt; Channeling Engelbart\u2019s energy, _The Dada of All Demos_ will take <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY|The Mother of All Demos> as its departure. Participants will engage in a collective scrolling performance lecture performed by Emma Rae Bruml Norton. The performance will seek to re-orient us to something which already exists in the world, something which we always already have a relationship to: the computer mouse.\nThe event is free, and you can register here: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-dada-of-all-demos-tickets-137830164733>\n\nFeb 24th, 7pm EST!",

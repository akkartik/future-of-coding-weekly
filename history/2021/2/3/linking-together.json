But shipping is better than perfect (worse is better), so we got that. And we saw that it was good (enough). And commercializable.\n\nThat's why the old papers of the 1960-80s have so much interesting material for \"new\" ideas that are desperately needed today. One might have to update the technology they were envisioned in back then, although I'm not even sure about that\u2026"

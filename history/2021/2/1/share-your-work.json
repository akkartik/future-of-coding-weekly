I could then use LeMP macros to straightforwardly convert the syntax tree of a particular language into a mostly-common format. And comments could be preserved too, as I have written a language-agnostic algorithm for this purpose.\n\nNow, from the readme and article about tree-hugger it doesn't _look_ like tree-hugger does something like this, but correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThis wasn't the problem I was interested in solving - I wanted to figure out how to go in the reverse direction, from Loyc tree to text, because part of my dream is to help people convert code between languages. But seeing this video makes me want to ask if conversion to a common format is something that would help the Docly project. If so, I available to help at below-market rates.\n\nYou could certainly have a separate ML model for each language - there may be enough code on GitHib to support this approach, at least for popular languages, but perhaps not for new or obscure languages. But if you convert all languages to a common format, a single model might be able to share intuitions across languages, potentially allowing improved summarization in a single model.",

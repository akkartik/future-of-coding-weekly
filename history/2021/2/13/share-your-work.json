As part of that I added a CI step which built the app and played a chord using Github actions on all 3 platforms, and did a quick demo of combining Sonic Pi and GPU shaders - this functions as an API test and demo; it is not intended to replace the existing UI.\nIn February\nI'm working on a more private project in my spare time.  Some time in March/April when I'm let back into the open again (!) I will get back to my music project, which may well take a turn towards more of a graph-based editor - since I did some research into that over Christmas; getting to the point where I have a flexible UI for displaying nodes, and the ability to drag them around on screen.\n<https://youtu.be/cl1ABJLMvRc>",

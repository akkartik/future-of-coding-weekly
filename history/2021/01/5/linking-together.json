For example, my side project is maintaining system level safety properties under composition while maintaining some level of productivity. The math is super difficult and it may not even work within the heat death of universe."

Anyone reading this post probably used at least two of these technologies today, MacOS/iOS users have likely benefitted from all four.\n\nThere's definitely a cultural problem around how modern OSS work is funded.  The idea that individuals should fund the projects they use out of after tax salary while companies carry on building empire on the backs of OSS contributors is grotesque, and I'm still fairly bitter that I wasn't able to get Google to put any money (beyond Summer of Code projects) into improving _emacs_ even though half their engineers were using it daily.\n\n&gt; it also killed the market for development of better software tools.

Yes they're all progress, but the last one seems different at a fundamental level. Brings very new possibilities, and new limitations. What if it was required that all invented modes of transport must stop at, start at, and follow the railway tracks only (compatibility!). How to invent airplanes in this world? This is the curious nature of software. It's not just objects, it is also the space within which these objects live, and much of that is entrenched."

High-level operations around developer intent\n2. Early feedback (like pair-programming) which is also given asynchronously (like pull request reviews)\n3. Compatible with existing tooling\nOn the website - <https://getsturdy.com/> there are some short clips of how it works.  It's pretty easy to try out, I would love to hear what you folks think.\n\nSturdy is itself open source - <https://github.com/sturdy-dev/sturdy> (stars welcome :slightly_smiling_face: ).\nCheers!",

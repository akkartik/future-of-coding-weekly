The term \u201csoftware diagnosis\u201d refers to recently innovated techniques from automated software analysis and software visual analytics that aim at giving insights into information about complex software system implementations, the correlated software development processes, and the system evolution. To this end, all common, traditionally separated infomation sources of software development get automatically extracted, related, and combined. The ultimate goals of these techniques are to provide not only software engineers but also all other stakeholders better instruments to monitor, to comprehend, to discuss, and to steer software development activities. In particular we will investigate how \u201csoftware maps\u201d as cartography-oriented, general-purpose, powerful visual analytics instruments can be used to improve software development effectiveness and transparency.\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdmaUqnmrw0&amp;list=PLoOmvuyo5UAfyyE3b5eRaDjRAD7u8vl1R&amp;index=1|Intro Video>, <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoOmvuyo5UAfyyE3b5eRaDjRAD7u8vl1R|Full playlist>",

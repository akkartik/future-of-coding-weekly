Someone choosing whether to invest more in what they know vs what they don't shouldn't just be considering effort but also risk, the odds that the thing you end up with is broken in subtle ways that warp your sense-making. The classic example of this is the bugs found in the spreadsheet behind Reinhardt and Rogoff's influential paper: <https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646>\n\nThis is why Alan Kay harps on the right representation. The problem with pushing on excel for functions and tests and version control isn't just that they're harder, it's that it is harder to trust the results.\n\nWhich is not to say the right representation has to be text or anything. But advances in representation are few and far between. The ones we know how to use are the ones we should build bridges to lead everyone to. Otherwise we risk building bridges to nowhere.",

Someone choosing whether to invest more in what they know vs what they don't shouldn't just be considering effort but also risk, the odds that the thing you end up with is broken in subtle ways that warp your sense-making. The classic example of this is the bugs found in the spreadsheet behind Reinhardt and Rogoff's influential paper: "

The problem with pushing on excel for functions and tests and version control isn't just that they're harder, it's that it is harder to trust the results.\n\nWhich is not to say the right representation has to be text or anything. But advances in representation are few and far between. The ones we know how to use are the ones we should build bridges to lead everyone to. Otherwise we risk building bridges to nowhere."

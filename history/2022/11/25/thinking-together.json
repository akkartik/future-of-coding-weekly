So, instead of working on shared mutable networks (that *is* knowledge), we turned to texts (a serialized, final form of a current knowledge) that can refer to other texts. The competing ideas of referring were Dr. Ted Nelson's transclusion in Xanadu and Sir Tim Berners-Lee's implementation of hyperlinks.

The much better Xanadu failed for 50 years because it contains three fundamental flaws, ironically the cure was there in Dr. Nelson's other idea, the Zigzag database all the time (but that's another story).\n3. As a conclusion, the current thinking of links is that they point to, and sometimes into a stream. If you see it written in a sentence, it tells you why it does not work: this approach can't handle changes and versioning. That requires an opposite approach, accepting that knowledge is a constantly changing network of which we create persistent snapshots and through the links you must be able to see the momentary state and navigate through the changes. Of course, this is much more complicated than books, this is why computers are still just paper-simulators - but <https://youtu.be/KdnGPQaICjk|Dr. Nelson is much better at explaining it>. _Those damned cats!_\n_That's my (bit more than) 2 cents._",

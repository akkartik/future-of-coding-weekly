I was thinking about the following question an the answer was less clear than I was originally thinking.\nWhat is the fundamental difference between a Repl and a Shell? In my opinion there is very little, the main differences seem to be what systems they are plugged into. i.e. a shell is plugged into the os and  a repl is language specific. Also if we add the nice feature of being able to change previous expressions do both end up looking effectively like a code notebook.\nSo the final feeling is just that a code notebook is just a fancy Repl.\nIn which case are code notebooks the future of Repl's/shells. Would you like a code notebook that was able to read your os processes and replace the sell?",

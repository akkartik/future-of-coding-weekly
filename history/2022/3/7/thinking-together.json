When analyzed they become information.\"\n\nWhat is the difference between a \"fact\" and \"information\"? If something needs to be analyzed to be considered information, does that mean an encyclopedia is not information until a human or machine reads it? What does it mean to \"analyze\"? If the encyclopedia emits photons, and those photons interact with other matter in the world, then has the encyclopedia been analyzed? If so, then the encyclopedia is in a _constant_ state of being analyzed, and so is every piece of data. To exist is to be analyzed. Thus the distinction evaporates. (See also: Appendix A below).\n\n<@UJBAJNFLK> \"Data is any symbolic expression using a well-defined notation. Information is data presented in a context that allows its interpretation.\"\n\nCan data exist outside of the physical universe? If not, then every piece of data is continually surrounded by a context \u2014 its physical environment.\n\nMoreover, your use of the term \"interpretation\" is synonymous with Mariano's \"analyze\", and so I will again assert that data is _constantly_ being interpreted by its environment \u2014 even if unintentionally.\n\n<@U02028JHX37> \"The term 'data' communicates that any internal structure and relations to external objects are irrelevant.\"\n\nI can accept this definition. But is it useful in reality? In what situations is it important to stress that you don't care about the structure and relationships that a piece of information expresses? In what situations would using the word \"information\" mislead a reader where your definition of \"data\" would not?\n\n<@U9C92716C> \"I would define information operationally as data that leads an agent to update its internal model of its environment.\"\n\nThis seems very close to the earlier definitions that \"information is data that has been analyzed or interpreted\". Thus, I shall refer you to my responses to those, and also to Appendix A. (Also: what conditions are necessary for something to be considered an \"agent\"? Can an arbitrary collection of atoms be considered an agent?)\n\n<@U016VUZGUUQ> \"I contend that just because a term is tricky to define doesn't mean it's useless. In what actual situation does the common understanding of \"data\" fail?\"\n\nIn general, I agree. However, there are hundreds (thousands?) of research papers, books, and blog posts which laboriously try to articulate a difference between \"data\" and \"information\", not to mention companies that are trying to sell products and services related to \"information systems\". The amount of human effort spent on understanding the (imagined) distinction is considerable. That's the \"harm\" I'm talking about.\n\n<@UL2SJ88Q3> \"I'm curious to hear what you think is an equivalent term for 'data' that is more broadly understood... I'm not coming up with one.\"\n\nInformation :innocent: (or \"formation\": see Appendix A).\n\n*Appendix A:*\nSome of the responses in this thread come close to describing information as a _process_, rather than a _thing_. One might suggest that \"information\" is the _process_ of analyzing something, or the _process_ of updating an agent's internal model. In simpler words: information is the process of *informing*. If we accept this definition, then we still need to describe what _things_ (objects) are involved in an occurrence of informing. An obvious term that could help us is \"formation\" (or \"form\"). We could say: to *inform* is to create a formation (in someone's mind, in a computer, or more generally, at any location in the universe). \"In-formation\" is then the process of creating such a formation. But what _induces_ a formation to be created? Well... interactions _between_ formations of course! (This matches up with physics: the configuration of the universe is fully determined by interactions between matter and/or energy.)\n\nGiven these definitions, the term \"data\" would be a synonym for \"formation\". I could accept that.",

It is true that most people are using the term \"data\" every day, and are effectively communicating with other humans, even though the term does not have a precise definition.\n\nI think the sorities paradox you've linked to pretty much nails the problem with the idea that data is something \"directly observed\", or something that has \"not yet been analysed\". Such a definition involves laying down a line/boundary, but in reality it seems such a boundary (between \"direct\" and \"indirect\", or between \"un-analysed\" and \"analysed\") cannot be made precise.\n\nPerhaps you can make \"data\" precise by defining it as information which is given as input to a _particular_ computation/analysis. But that would make the term synonymous with \"argument\" or \"input\". (I'm pretty sure this was the _original_ meaning of \"data\" in its modern usage.)",

It is true that most people are using the term \"data\" every day, and are effectively communicating with other humans, even though the term does not have a precise definition.\n\nI think the sorities paradox you've linked to pretty much nails the problem with the idea that data is something \"directly observed\", or something that has \"not yet been analysed\". Such a definition involves laying down a line/boundary, but in reality it seems such a boundary (between \"direct\" and \"indirect\", or between \"un-analysed\" and \"analysed\") cannot be made precise.\n\nPerhaps you can make \"data\" precise by defining it as information which is given as input to a "

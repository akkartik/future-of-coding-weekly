I turned his presentation in to a little video attached below. Keep in mind, Mech is still very early and there's no error messages, yet he demoed this in one take live in front of the class. It's the programming-demo equivalent to pitching a no hitter imo. I was very impressed! If anyone out there has job openings consider Haocheng!\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNvTTd6rp3w>",

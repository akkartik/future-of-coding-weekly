The overall code structure is an object tree (class hierarchy), of which methods are the leaves and the only nodes that have a text representation.\n\nYou can of course represent Smalltalk code as text files. That's what GNU Smalltalk does. It's also what Pharo (the Smalltalk that I use) does for storing code in git repositories. (see "

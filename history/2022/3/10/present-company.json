        "text": "Hi fellow FoC community folks!\n\nYou probably know me from.. well.. being the moderator here, doing the podcast, maybe from Twitter. I'm going to put on a different scarf today.\n\nI'm looking to hire someone.\n\nI work for a little company based in western Canada that builds interactive multimedia tools &amp; simulations. You can imagine emoji sparkles interposed between those 1990s buzzwords if you like. The team is 7 artists, 3 subject matter experts, 1 programmer (hi), and a few other folks for admin and such. My job is to build tools for the artists, who make multimedia for the subject matter experts, who use it to teach people around the world about mind-blowingly complex machines. We're _tiny_ compared to the audience we serve (from high-school students up to terrifying multinationals), but we've got an unbelievable reputation in our corner of the world for being like 20 years ahead of the competition. It's a weird company. I love it.\n\nYou might know I've been working on a project called Hest. It's an attempt to take some of the work we do on visualizing complex systems, and apply it to node-wire visual programming. Well, I'm looking for someone to come help me work on a complementary project \u2014 building a new drawing tool for the artists on my team. They currently do their drawings in Adobe Animate (because we used to use Flash, because the 2000s were a beautiful time for multimedia and we're not even close to recapturing that culturally or technologically). They export their drawings as SVG files, and then bring them to life using some JS animation/simulation frameworks I wrote for them.\n\nThere's a problem: \"export their drawings as SVG files\". An SVG is a great container for a vector image. It's an awful container, especially when generated by a general-purpose drawing app like Adobe Animate, for rich semantic information about what the artist means for their drawing to represent, especially when the drawing is a very specific kind of technical illustration.\n\nSo here's the plan: We'd like to design and prototype a new drawing tool. Something like OmniGraffle, but _much_ simpler. There'd be some sort of library of common symbols, which you could drag and drop onto a canvas, and then wire together with a few different kinds of path drawing tools. Finally, the program could (perhaps) export a much richer SVG with a bunch of metadata that preserves various aspects of the intent behind the drawing. (I say \"perhaps\" because there's a lot of different approaches that could be taken, and making that decision would be part of the R&amp;D process).\n\nOnce this drawing tool exists, the goal is to push it in the direction of being a tool for programming said drawings. We already have a simulation toolkit that works with SVG graphics that the artists know well, but there's so much more we could do by giving them live / visual programming that happens right in same tool as their drawing canvas, not some detached build-&gt;run-&gt;debug process with a text editor like they have today. And whereas the goal with Hest was to start with the programming experience and build \"down\" toward a usable tool for dynamic drawings, the goal for this new project is to start with a usable drawing tool and build \"up\" toward making those drawings dynamic.\n\nThis is already a wall of text, but I'll share one more bit of detail that should be a helpful filtering function for folks who might be interested in this project. This is planned to be a 3 month contract position where you'll do some initial R&amp;D work and build as much of a prototype as you can \u2014 a way to get the ball rolling, and then hand it off to me (or possibly _yourself_ if we extend/renew the contract). The pay is also competitive for Canada, where we're based, but not what you might be used to if you're from a hotspot in the US \u2014 $2000/week USD.\n\nIf you have questions about this, please crack open a thread here and ask them. Ask anything, I'm very interested in being transparent about all details of this.\n\nFinally, here's <https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/jobs|a page on our website> where you can get a quick summary of who we are, watch a video of simulations we've made, and read a slightly less wall-of-text description of the position at the bottom (it's the 3rd job listed, the one about an interactive drawing tool).\n\nThe position is open now, I'm setting up calls ASAP, so if you're interested by all means let me know! &lt;3",

A rendering surface, a scene graph, some sort of coordinate system / matrix math to render things in the right place (though possibly just handled by SVG if that ends up being the rendering API used \u2014 to be determined).\n\nI think Rust would be a no-go for us, just because I'd have to maintain it and I don't know Rust (though I'd love to learn it, I just don't want to sign myself up for that on a deadline, haha).\n\nThat stuff I listed \u2014 scene graph, rendering, etc \u2014 that stuff is all fairly easy to set up in my experience (especially if you're happy leaning on the browser). The tricker parts are what you build on top of that, especially when it comes to GUI interactions and making them good feeling, reliable, etc."

Where the pro may have reason to optimize performance of a computation, an end-user wants to optimize time-to-answer.  At the end of the day, a 10,000x performance hit of doing the first dumb thing that comes to mind is fine since you can leave it running run overnight.  On the other extreme, when superior performance gives you answers as fast as you can pose questions, you can potentially start asking in a qualitatively different way.  It can get downright silly, \"let the machine ask the questions while we figure out how to filter the answers.\"  (I guess this ties into the data/information conversation.)",

De-facto standards originate with dominant players who find themselves at the center of an ecosystem that is beneficial for them.\nThe worst environment for emergent common representations is probably the digital feudalism that we see in today's platforms.\n\nAnother dimension is formal vs. informal representations. Formal representations encourage formal standards, informal representations encourage informal standards with many variants. Markdown is probably the best illustration of the latter.

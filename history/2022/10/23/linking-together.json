But that is a short paper that hints at ideas. We have no work that explores our discipline at depth the way other fields have philosophy of x or methodology of x. So as a field we haven\u2019t reflected enough. \n\nBut the way I used it in that last sentence is slightly different. We as individual programmers don\u2019t reflect enough on our own practice. We might think about best practices, we might consider how to solve problems we have, but we don\u2019t spend a lot of \u201carmchair time\u201d. \n\nEven if we aren\u2019t the ones coming up with great answers to these difficult questions, we need others to help us think more deeply about them. What exactly is an abstraction? What is the nature of a program? Why have we privileged some features of nature language in our programming language and denied others? Can our programs have meaning outside of what we intend then to? Where do they get that meaning? What do we mean we talk about an explanation for a bug? When is a reductive explanation if a bug useful and when is it not? What does that tell us about explanation?\n\nThere are so many questions we ought to sit and ponder. We are a culture that is good at arguing about things that honestly don\u2019t matter much. And bad at asking fundamental questions and considering answers to them. \n\nI have some not fully formed ideas about why this lack of reflection has happened in our culture. First is a deep seeded implicit belief in positivism that so many programmers hold. We often believe that only measurable scientific things are meaningful and so dismiss philosophy. \n\nBut I also think this lack of reflection comes from our frustrations of the kinds of work we have to do day today and yet the realization that we have it pretty darn good. We have great job security and great pay. But the software we are forced to make is terrible. \n\nIn this environment, deep reflection does not help us at all. It just reminds us how shallow our work truly is. Instead, we constantly try to find ways to feel our work had more meaning. Hence to following if trends, the gatekeeping, and the tribal behavior. \n\nI don\u2019t think we need to slow down the process of making software. Just that we need to care about the \u201cnon practical\u201d questions of our field. We need to think much more deeply about the work we do, think kind of work we want to do, and the nature of our work. ",

        "text": "<@UK3LH8CF5> Exactly as you say: we need to focus on the \u201cbig picture\u201d view of a given program, in order to reflect on its constitution/composition/architecture and employed methodologies.\n\nBut I can\u2019t see why you think this is antithetic to focusing on structures/patterns embedded in the code? I think it can help; it\u2019s the first step to understand the program. Of course, this assumes that the primary goal is utilitarian (the program should work). However, I think this comes hand in hand with the more \u201caesthetic\u201d appreciation of software.\n\nI don\u2019t know about other people, but two properties of (some) programs I find very beautiful is _emergence_ and _reflectivity_. In other words, the fact that a composition of a few simple programs can generate complex behaviour, and that there are (many) programs generate a whole new world inside them (and that they\u2019re embedded in these worlds). In most (all?) \u201cart heavily depending on software\u201d/\u201csoftware being art\u201d I\u2019ve seen, it was especially emergence that \u201cmade it artistic\u201d (I\u2019m not counting surface design).\n\nAs one quickly realizes, these two properties make software very complex, so in order not to be stuck just blindly experimenting, one needs to employ some tools to understand programs (and finding structures and patterns is the most basic form of that; it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked).\n\n(Blind experiments can be good (to test the boundaries of the current theory), but imagine composing music just by pushing random keys on the piano. That\u2019s no way to be much productive, even artistic. Without (music) theory, there would be no Bach.)",

I think it can help; it\u2019s the first step to understand the program. Of course, this assumes that the primary goal is utilitarian (the program should work). However, I think this comes hand in hand with the more \u201caesthetic\u201d appreciation of software.\n\nI don\u2019t know about other people, but two properties of (some) programs I find very beautiful is "

In other words, the fact that a composition of a few simple programs can generate complex behaviour, and that there are (many) programs generate a whole new world inside them (and that they\u2019re embedded in these worlds).

That\u2019s no way to be much productive, even artistic. Without (music) theory, there would be no Bach.)"

Essentially, Smalltalk was killed in the 90s by Java and the Web, while also being expensive and slow. Even today, tools like GToolkit are tied to the desktop way of software, while general computing moves more and more to the Web. As a language released almost 40 years ago, Smalltalk lacks features found in newer dynamic languages, like first-class map/dicts and optional typing, and has different names for common classes/methods. Perhaps there is another world where Smalltalk won in the 90s and Java didn't sour the programming world on OOP, but in this world Smalltalk, like Lisp, lives on in a tiny community of the devoted.",

Even today, tools like GToolkit are tied to the desktop way of software, while general computing moves more and more to the Web. As a language released almost 40 years ago, Smalltalk lacks features found in newer dynamic languages, like first-class map/dicts and optional typing, and has different names for common classes/methods. Perhaps there is another world where Smalltalk won in the 90s and Java didn't sour the programming world on OOP, but in this world Smalltalk, like Lisp, lives on in a tiny community of the devoted."

I'll use an example to elucidate:\n\nTake a rectangle of base `b` and height `h`. It's common to think of these as \"independent\" variables and define quantities like the following as \"dependent\":\n\n\u2022 `perimeter(b, h) =&gt; 2*(b+h)`\n\u2022 `area(b, h) =&gt; b*h`\n\u2022 `diagonal(b, h) =&gt; sqrt(b^2+h^2)`\nBut if I were to ask, what are the base and height of a rectangle whose area is `a` and diagonal is `d`, our programming languages have no tooling to do this (except the symbolic manipulation libraries for computer algebra). All the required information is there but we have privileged `b` and `h` over `area` and `diagonal` and thus, we now need to figure out the formula for side lengths and program it as the function `sides(a, d)`\n\nI should be able to describe a structure, and auto-generate all possible functions (including for currying and partial applications, and while we are at it, all the partial derivatives with respect to each other) so that i can just declare what is known and what I want to calculate. A rectangle can then be represented with any set of variables that make everything else determinable. I should get access to all possible constructors like  `new Rectangle(area: a, diagonal: d)`.\n\nAnd I want to see this be available for all programming tasks, not just algebra/math. For creating a graph, is the constructor `new Graph(Nodes[], Edges[])` really the privileged one? Why not build languages in a way that I automatically get the constructor `new Graph(AdjacencyMatrix)` and the instance methods `graph.getNodes()` and `graph.getEdges()?`",

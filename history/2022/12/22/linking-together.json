It is also *beta-optimal*, meaning that, for higher-order computations, it can be exponentially faster than alternatives, including Haskell's GHC.\nThat is possible due to a new model of computation, the *Interaction Net*, which supersedes the *Turing Machine* and the *Lambda Calculus*. Previous implementations of this model have been inefficient in practice, however, a recent breakthrough has drastically improved its efficiency, resulting in the HVM. Despite being relatively new, it already beats mature compilers in many cases, and is set to scale towards uncharted levels of performance.\n*Welcome to the massively parallel future of computers!*\n\n<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540197926432?ref=pdf_download&amp;fr=RR-2&amp;rr=77d9648ffe1f9171|Interaction Combinators Paper>\n\nIt is shown that a very simple system of _interaction combinators_, with only three symbols and six rules, is a universal model of distributed computation, in a sense that will be made precise. This paper is the continuation of the author's work on _interaction nets_, inspired by Girard's proof nets for _linear logic_, but no preliminary knowledge of these topics is required for its reading.\n\n*<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets|Interaction nets>* are a graphical <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation|model of computation> devised by <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yves_Lafont&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1|Yves Lafont> in 1990 as a generalisation of the proof structures of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic|linear logic>. An interaction net system is specified by a set of agent types and a set of interaction rules. Interaction nets are an inherently distributed model of computation in the sense that computations can take place simultaneously in many parts of an interaction net, and no synchronisation is needed. The latter is guaranteed by the strong confluence property of reduction in this model of computation. Thus interaction nets provide a natural language for massive parallelism.",

Interaction nets are an inherently distributed model of computation in the sense that computations can take place simultaneously in many parts of an interaction net, and no synchronisation is needed. The latter is guaranteed by the strong confluence property of reduction in this model of computation. Thus interaction nets provide a natural language for massive parallelism."

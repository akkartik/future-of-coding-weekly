In recent years more and more sharding solutions are implemented you can see that with polkadots parachain model, Cosmos, RChain , Cardano,  even in the Ethereum Ecosystem there are are many \"satelite\" Efforts like Gnosis Chain. These Efforts point not only to technical difficulties but in my opinion its a cultural thing. Human beings are not like a global bee hive cluster, or bork cluster for that matter. We have distinct cultural and local history backgrounds. We are still looking for ways to express this with technology and its accompanying patterns of behaviour ( what seymour papert called computing cultures)",

In recent years more and more sharding solutions are implemented you can see that with polkadots parachain model, Cosmos, RChain , Cardano,  even in the Ethereum Ecosystem there are are many \"satelite\" Efforts like Gnosis Chain. These Efforts point not only to technical difficulties but in my opinion its a cultural thing. Human beings are not like a global bee hive cluster, or bork cluster for that matter. We have distinct cultural and local history backgrounds. We are still looking for ways to express this with technology and its accompanying patterns of behaviour ( what seymour papert called computing cultures)"

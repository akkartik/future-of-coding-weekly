We'll be reading a number of papers from the history of our field, ranging from the beloved classics we all know by heart, to obscure and mysterious potential alternate histories that never came to be, and perhaps \u2014 perhaps! \u2014 one or two papers that really deserve nothing more than to wrap a dead fish. First up, squarely in the _beloved_ camp, a classic from \"Licky\" himself.\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode \u2014 the paper was a fun read, and I think that really came through in our discussion. Also, I want to personally thank Jimmy for suggesting we do this together (and then patiently waiting for 9 months for me to finish Crosscut). I think this will breathe new life into the podcast, and help me keep new episodes coming out at a regular clip in the gaps where I'm too overwhelmed with * gestures everywhere * to do interviews.

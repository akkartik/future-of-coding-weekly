Licklider (<http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf|http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf>)\n\nIn our first series of episodes going through some papers (<https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055|https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055>) we discuss man-computer symbiosis.\n\nIf I were to put together a list of the most influential papers in computer science this would definitely make the list. The paper is really the first paper that imagines personal computing. While it may not have predicting everyone owning a computer. It definitely imagined a future that looks quite similar to the one we have today.\n\nI think the other striking thing about this paper is just how practically minded it was. It says a large vision, but also talks about a way to achieve it. In some ways it feels mundane today, but I think this mundanity is actually its virtue. If you are looking for a paper to learn from for proposing your own idea in the future of coding, this is a great paper to consider. \n\nDefinitely worth a read",

                "text": "One of the most frustrating experiences about using computers is when you try to do something, and the system freezes up or is otherwise slow. This is latency - the unacceptably large amount of time between when an action is triggered by the user and the response to that action by the computer is relayed to the user. It\u2019s something that people have come to expect as a \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of using computers, but frankly, it\u2019s an utterly unacceptable one.",

No discussion of how to export/migrate data between apps\n\u2022 The protocol defines data and functions that embedding app needs to provide to blocks.\n    \u25e6 The protocol does not define the mechanism to provide these. That's why React/iframe/web-components are possible compatible implementations (though unspecified). This can potentially fragment the ecosystem, so iiuc they plan to spec this as well\n\u2022 The spec also does not define how blocks are distributed, how end users can search or add them\nThis does not seem like \"userspace reusable blocks\".

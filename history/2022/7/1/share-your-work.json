I prefer text based systems, UIs are too clunky for creating scripts. (though I have to admit, I have a plan for a \"ui\" like system for devs like me)\n\n\u2022 I didn't like the way adding options created inputs below, they would probably be easier to relate / understand if they were inline. For example, when I click \"header\", just add a row with two inputs for key/value.\n\u2022 The dots look like a drag-n-drop reorder indicator, the vertical three dots typically used for menus would probably be better. Reordering would also be a good feature\n\u2022 I think tooltips would be helpful, especially on icons\n\u2022 lifting the remove button up (as an \"X\") would make it easy to remove entries added by misclicks / exploration.\nDocs will definitely help uptake, anecdotally from my own projects",

Summarizing, it sounds like the key ideas for scalable, discoverable UIs are:\n\n\u2022 one-level menus\n\u2022 off to an edge so they don't obscure people's stuff\n\u2022 that are context sensitive\n\u2022 that show keyboard shortcuts\n\u2022 that expand to something like a ribbon bar when you click on them\n\u2022 that allow searching to filter through their contents\nThis makes a lot of sense. I'll move the palette to the bottom and blend it with the wordstar-like menu I've done before. It's already context-sensitive, though in an ugly, hard-coded way because it's quite a simple tool at the moment and there's only a few context-sensitive exceptions.\n\n---\n\nI'm still thinking about focus follows mouse. It's something I've never used before. But I think I see where you're coming from; the current metaphor is already focus follows mouse to some extent since stuff outside the viewport implicitly goes out of focus. Why require an extra click to switch panes within the viewport.\n\nWould you prefer focus follows mouse with all panes being editable? Or should I perhaps restrict focus follows mouse to only when a pane is not being edited?",

It's something I've never used before. But I think I see where you're coming from; the current metaphor is already focus follows mouse to some extent since stuff outside the viewport implicitly goes out of focus. Why require an extra click to switch panes within the viewport.\n\nWould you prefer focus follows mouse with all panes being editable? Or should I perhaps restrict focus follows mouse to only when a pane is not being edited?"

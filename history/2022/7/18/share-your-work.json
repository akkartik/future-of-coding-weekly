This is so pervasive that if you look around for examples of smear frames in 3d cartoons, you only see frames with motion blur (and maybe a little squash / stretch, which isn't too unusual or tricky since the mid 00s, [caveat, caveat, etc]). Smear frames are beautiful and wildly expressive and are created lovingly, individually. Motion blur is pretty much an automatic \"How much do you want?\" algorithm.

Not true of smear frames from classic Disney vs WB vs (etc).\n\n_An_ animation frustration is that 2d animation tools let you work frame-by-frame, or use tweens. Tweens are ugly by default, and _fine_ at best. Frame-by-frame is the only way to make transcendently _beautiful_ motion. (There are exceptions, of course, but they prove the rule). But, frame-by-frame is only moderately better on a computer than it was when done on paper. There are probably tremendous gains to be had by improving how computers help you do frame-by-frame animation (<https://www.iorama.studio/looom|Looom> comes to mind), and by improving tweens.\n\nFor all of the above, it's worth noting that I'm talking very much about the way things move and change over time.

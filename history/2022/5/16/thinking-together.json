Perhaps I should bring y'all in:\n\u2022 <https://lobste.rs/s/i1b6tw/computer_science_was_always_supposed_be#c_2mffpq>\n\u2022 <https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/35/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-38>\n\u2022 <https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/107896035093628757>\n\u2022 <https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/108043961340591227> (and thread)\nThe conclusion I've currently arrived at is:\n\u2022 The kind of computers we have today prioritizes large organizations that pay people with money. The influence of this mindset is deep and infects almost all our tools. This \"computer industrial complex\" is often useful on short timescales, but it is also blind to a lot of the value people create with it. As a result, future decisions by the computer industrial complex often destroy value at people scales. \n\u2022 Right from the start (suspense alert), there's been a shadow computer with a different, more convivial purpose. Confusingly, this shadow computer often looks just like other computers. You have to look closely to look past the camouflage.\n\u2022 It's hard to see what people would do with these shadow computers if we weren't immersed in a world created by organizations. After some time thinking about it, I can't find a better answer than the one (drumroll) Vannevar Bush arrived at, right at the start: one thing convivial computers are _definitely_ for is to externalize our brains. Paper expands memory. Computers expand both memory and modeling.\nThis is a surprising, even shocking, conclusion for me to arrive at. I've always slightly looked down my nose at all the \"tools for thought\" conversations in this Slack. It's felt too close to productivity porn most suitable to avoid doing anything productive. Suddenly they're super relevant.\n\nBut it's not enough to build more tools for thought. We have to think also about the process by which they're built. We have to ensure that the people-factory generating the convivial iPhone is also convivial.

Paraphrasing here, the computer is a communications medium that allows us to share simulations of our ideas with other people which they can then run, modify, and test in order to better understand and question the ideas being communicated. It is personal in the sense that anyone can use it to create simulations of their ideas and share them. It is dynamic in that the simulation can respond to the recipient of the message who is attempting to understand it. The recipient can ask the simulation \"what if?\" questions of the sort that have only historically been possible when conversing directly with the person who has the idea.\n\nIt can also allow others to respond to and critique messages by pointing out flaws in a simulation and publishing an improved version.\n\nUltimately, by allowing us to think and communicate more deeply about complex issues, this could help bring about another enlightenment in the same way that the printing press helped bring about the last one by allowing people to communicate ideas and arguments that were too long to remember all at once.",

Paraphrasing here, the computer is a communications medium that allows us to share simulations of our ideas with other people which they can then run, modify, and test in order to better understand and question the ideas being communicated. It is personal in the sense that anyone can use it to create simulations of their ideas and share them. It is dynamic in that the simulation can respond to the recipient of the message who is attempting to understand it. The recipient can ask the simulation \"what if?\" questions of the sort that have only historically been possible when conversing directly with the person who has the idea.\n\nIt can also allow others to respond to and critique messages by pointing out flaws in a simulation and publishing an improved version.\n\nUltimately, by allowing us to think and communicate more deeply about complex issues, this could help bring about another enlightenment in the same way that the printing press helped bring about the last one by allowing people to communicate ideas and arguments that were too long to remember all at once."

It's just a very convenient tool for *stuff*.\n\nYou see the first case much more in universities, it's there, but its not connected to business. You get random software that a prof made for enumerating mathematical objects in _such and such_ space. Thats the computer as a mind extender. Its lovely.

                "text": "In sociology of scientific knowledge, Planck's principle is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.\nThis was formulated by Max Planck:\nA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it ...An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.\nInformally, this is often paraphrased as \"Science progresses one funeral at a time\".  \nPlanck's quote has been used by Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend and others to argue that scientific revolutions are non-rational, rather than spreading through \"mere force of truth and fact\". It has been described as Darwinian rather than Lamarckian conceptual evolution.Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of evolution in the years after Darwin's On the Origin of Species, age was a minor factor. On a more specialized scale, it also was a weak factor in accepting cliometrics. A study of when different geologists accepted plate tectonics found that older scientists actually adopted it sooner than younger scientists. However, a more recent study on life science researchers found that following the deaths of preeminent researchers, publications by their collaborators rapidly declined while the activity of non-collaborators and the number of new researchers entering their field rose.",

Suffice it to say for this conversation that the profit motive has given us an extremely twisted major use for computing: social media. If profit above all else is the motive, then Facebook/Twitter et al will do whatever it takes to increase their profits. They do this by way of advertising money. The suggestion / content algorithms maximize \"user engagement.\" And since we humans are hard-wired to pay attention to extremes (\"if it bleeds, it leads\"), the algorithm has no choice but to suggest more and more extreme content. We have witnessed this again and again in mass shootings and in general political divisiveness around the world. This barely scratches the surface.\n\nAnd if you wonder \"why doesn't Facebook do something about it,\" an internal FB group was instructed to research the extent of FB's influence on extremist activity and came to the conclusion that yes, FB is contributing to global instability and that the best course of action for the benefit of humanity was to fundamentally change FB's business model. Mark Zuckerberg waved the warning aside and told them to never bring it up again.",

Suffice it to say for this conversation that the profit motive has given us an extremely twisted major use for computing: social media. If profit above all else is the motive, then Facebook/Twitter et al will do whatever it takes to increase their profits. They do this by way of advertising money. The suggestion / content algorithms maximize \"user engagement.\" And since we humans are hard-wired to pay attention to extremes (\"if it bleeds, it leads\"), the algorithm has no choice but to suggest more and more extreme content. We have witnessed this again and again in mass shootings and in general political divisiveness around the world. This barely scratches the surface.\n\nAnd if you wonder \"why doesn't Facebook do something about it,\" an internal FB group was instructed to research the extent of FB's influence on extremist activity and came to the conclusion that yes, FB is contributing to global instability and that the best course of action for the benefit of humanity was to fundamentally change FB's business model. Mark Zuckerberg waved the warning aside and told them to never bring it up again."

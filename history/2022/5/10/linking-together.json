If someone were to ask me something like \"how do if statements and while loops help me write a video game?\" I can only think of answers that are unintelligible until after a person has learned the necessary concepts that are bigger than \"if\"and smaller than \"video game.\" \n\nIf they don't have a mental map from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain, how can I show them that the first step actually takes them up a path that will get to the top of the mountain?"

Most pull requests (about 2/3) get merged without corrections, and the idea is to have the bot detect and approve them. This was born out frustration constantly waiting for 'code review' for small and safe code contribution, especially since I believe in \"ship small &amp; often. Also it allows you to focus on the trickier changes instead.\n\n:point_right: Here's how it works: anybody can do a 'historical' test on any repository here - <https://codeball.ai/> to test out the accuracy. To do reviews on new pull requests, it's setup as a GitHub action.\nI'd love to hear what you smart people think! Happy to also share more about the model too (basically it's a neural net, the inputs include features about the code, the author and author experience with the code changed, trained on over 1M code contributions).",

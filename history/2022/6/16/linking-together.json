However, the most useful/advanced ones fail to reach even a moderately sized userbase, since actually using the tools requires a long time of specialized training. An undertaking focused on creating a good \u201cuser interface\u201d to these mathematical tools would be greatly beneficial for the society.\n\nThis would have the potential to raise mathematical literacy, which I believe is partly a prerequisite for advancing computing literacy."

(Many areas do and in many different ways.)  In this particular area, you start with a direct connection between a shadow cast on a puzzle panel and the correct path you should trace on the panel.  As the series of puzzle panels progresses, intervening objects obscure the connection in a bunch of different and gradually more significant ways until, near the end, you see a panel in full sunlight.

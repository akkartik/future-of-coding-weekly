Like, you want to make TV because you love TV. Because there\u2019s stuff that you just _love_.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you\u2019ve got really good taste, and you get into this thing, that \u2013 I don\u2019t even know how to describe it \u2013 it\u2019s like there\u2019s a gap. That for the first couple of years that you\u2019re making stuff, what you\u2019re making isn\u2019t so good. It\u2019s not that great. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it\u2019s not that good. But your _taste_ is still killer.\n&gt; \n&gt; And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you\u2019re making is kind of a disappointment to you\u2026 you can tell that it\u2019s still sort of crappy. A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the thing that I would like to say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn\u2019t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew that it fell short\u2026 that it didn\u2019t have the special thing that we wanted it to have.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the thing I would say to you is, everybody goes through that. And for you to go through it, if you\u2019re going through it right now, if you\u2019re just getting out that phase, or you\u2019re just starting off and you\u2019re entering into that phase, you\u2019ve got to know that it\u2019s totally normal, and the most important possible thing that you can do is do a lot of work, do a huge volume of work\u2026 [Put yourself] in a situation where you have to churn out the work, because it\u2019s only by actually going through a volume of work that you actually then catch up and close that gap, and the work that you\u2019re making will be as good as our ambitions.",

A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit.\n\nAnd the thing that I would like to say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn\u2019t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew that it fell short\u2026 that it didn\u2019t have the special thing that we wanted it to have.\n\nAnd the thing I would say to you is, everybody goes through that. And for you to go through it, if you\u2019re going through it right now, if you\u2019re just getting out that phase, or you\u2019re just starting off and you\u2019re entering into that phase, you\u2019ve got to know that it\u2019s totally normal, and the most important possible thing that you can do is do a lot of work, do a huge volume of work\u2026 [Put yourself] in a situation where you have to churn out the work, because it\u2019s only by actually going through a volume of work that you actually then catch up and close that gap, and the work that you\u2019re making will be as good as our ambitions."

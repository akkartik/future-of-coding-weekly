That's kinda where I'm going with my politics these days! And I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with in the other project. Good stuff.\n\n&gt; The most significant comment I have on how you present the idea is that it needs more examples, and visuals of the examples then visuals of the framework.\n&gt; .\nOK. Point taken, and I'll add it to my fix-up list!\n\n&gt; The benefit of reality is that everyone's always building a model of reality in their head which we all independently verify against reality. I'm not entirely clear how that process would be possible efficiently at scale with this idea. I suspect perhaps through some sort of blockchain?\n&gt; .\nNot sure I get where you're going with this, :disappointed: sorry. Can you elaborate a little? Do you mean scaling up with different points of view? Thus harder to settle on common data types for shared data? That is, models that are specific to a person or group versus sharable models.\n\n&gt; It's super cool that there is a companion smartwatch! It's in line with something I thought about in the past.\n&gt; .\nOK - tell me more! The watch is a fun side project really. Just to keep the code lean and buildable on embedded devices for when the time comes that it's needed more.\n\n&gt; Let me give it some more thought and circle back in a week or so.\n&gt; .\nPlease do!",

Sure, it's \"objects\" are just small file systems, but that's still a very general infrastructure to build an object system on.\n&gt; .\nYes, I've been researching existing P2P infra to build upon. I ended up with a shortlist of one: OpenDHT! Trouble is that it has to (a) be written in C (or have a C header file) (b) NOT be bloody blockchain based! (c) be active and used not academic. I'll dig some more into Hypercore though, so thanks for that!",

It's not a huge hardship if you have to retype a word. Most of the time, words you type appear on screen. But I also notice that browsers used to bring up modal dialogs for say searching for a word on a page, and now they do so in a non-modal way where the panel pops up above or below the page while allowing you to interact with the page. I'm in text mode, so there's a fundamental limitation of only ever being able to interact where the cursor is. Perhaps that's the fundamental 'modefulness' here?

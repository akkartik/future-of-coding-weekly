Would ye oracles of the future of coding be willing to chime in on some of the technical aspects? It's for a non-profit that has the capacity to do a lot of practical good in the present world.\n\nThe grant is for a \"digital transformation\" of civil society in my province in Canada. The non-profit I'm building the proposal for is an organization that supports and financially audits over 150 community associations, representing over 20,000 volunteers and close to 1 million neighbours. My city is unique in the sense that a portion of our municipal operations are done by these distributed volunteer associations. As a rule however, these associations are very inefficient from a technological standpoint. Many of their workflows are done manually via paper.\n\nMy question is this. Do you think that the world of low-code/no-code solutions has become accessible enough for me to create a series of micro-grants for individual volunteer groups to do their own digital transformation? Or should I simply push all these associations through a unilateral transformation programme (like buying them all Google suite)?\n\nI am biased towards creating a series of competitions around specific workflows that need to be digitized, and using the grant funds to fund prizes. I've worked with close to 30 civic-tech volunteers over the last year with some success, taking that approach. However, it has some risks of longevity. Perhaps it would be wiser to just take off-the-shelf solutions.\n\nYet I see this (perhaps simplistically), as an invitation by a government body to rethink the society and technology interact. If we talk about how we wish the economics around coding was different, this strikes me as a practical opportunity to build an alternative model. When it comes to the long-lasting design of what that technology looks like, I'm out of my depth. What do you think?",

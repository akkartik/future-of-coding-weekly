While I come up with some scenarios, please free to also suggest things you wish you could do.\n\n<@UHWC9PXBL>\n\n&gt; my initial suspicion on the stack depth stuff is that the stack shouldn't ever really get too deep\n&gt; \nYeah, for sure, stack depth feels like less of a constraint compared to line length and how much horizontal space we devote to the stack state of each word.\n\nI don't care about compatibility with Unix or functional equivalence. Just something that is internally consistent and reasonably discoverable. I think if push came to shove I'd make the same trade-off as everyone else and compromise on discoverability.\n\n<@UDQBTJ211>\n\n&gt; Just infiniscroll to the right within in a window/frame (perhaps I'm misunderstanding the issue, this seems completely analogous to new lines in a source file).\n&gt; \nYou're right. If we can solve the problem of wide values on the stack, long lines seem viable.\n\n---\n\nOne constraint I hadn't mentioned until now: I'd like for the number of hotkeys this environment needs to be small enough that I can describe them all in the menu at the bottom for some reasonable screen width. Excluding intuitive stuff like arrow keys.\n\nI think I have a new idea after this thread. Values on the stack will have 3 possible states: collapsed, truncated and maximized. By default, any value wider/taller than some threshold will be collapsed -- except at the top of the stack, where it's truncated to the threshold width and height by default.\n\nNow we need just one new hotkey: toggle the top of stack at the cursor between trunated and maximized.\n\nMaximize does exactly what it sounds like. It puts you in full screen mode browsing the data as necessary. The idea is to avoid any ambiguity about what will scroll. No nested scrollbars.\n\nValues in the stack are always in read-only mode when maximized; you can only browse within them. This suggests an analogous maximized edit mode for input words (say literal strings or arrays). But I haven't thought that angle through.\n\nIdeally I'd like this to be the totality of the UI (or some single prototype UI) for the Mu computer. Just text mode, no mouse. A single cursor on screen, an infinite 2D space that you can move around in, containing panels (functions or sandboxes) that in turn contain values. Panels and values can be collapsed or maximized. Everything one can do to be done within this framework, whether it's editing code or browsing data or running programs. (Tentatively I imagine a single address space so strong sandboxing, no concurrency only lazy streams.)\n\nThoughts?",

If we can solve the problem of wide values on the stack, long lines seem viable.\n\n---\n\nOne constraint I hadn't mentioned until now: I'd like for the number of hotkeys this environment needs to be small enough that I can describe them all in the menu at the bottom for some reasonable screen width. Excluding intuitive stuff like arrow keys.\n\nI think I have a new idea after this thread. Values on the stack will have 3 possible states: collapsed, truncated and maximized. By default, any value wider/taller than some threshold will be collapsed -- except at the top of the stack, where it's truncated to the threshold width and height by default.\n\nNow we need just one new hotkey: toggle the top of stack at the cursor between trunated and maximized.\n\nMaximize does exactly what it sounds like. It puts you in full screen mode browsing the data as necessary. The idea is to avoid any ambiguity about what will scroll. No nested scrollbars.\n\nValues in the stack are always in read-only mode when maximized; you can only browse within them. This suggests an analogous maximized edit mode for input words (say literal strings or arrays). But I haven't thought that angle through.\n\nIdeally I'd like this to be the totality of the UI (or some single prototype UI) for the Mu computer. Just text mode, no mouse. A single cursor on screen, an infinite 2D space that you can move around in, containing panels (functions or sandboxes) that in turn contain values. Panels and values can be collapsed or maximized. Everything one can do to be done within this framework, whether it's editing code or browsing data or running programs. (Tentatively I imagine a single address space so strong sandboxing, no concurrency only lazy streams.)\n\nThoughts?"

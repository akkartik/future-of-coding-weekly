If this attempt fails to convey, I will whip up some codepen to illustrate what I mean.",

It's basically a \"backend builder\" (hosted db, models, CRUD and custom API, Admin UI) that helps developers build feature rich backends quickly. It speeds up your work by reducing the need for boilerplate, glue code, or bits and pieces you've built a million times (auth, permissions, ...) and it leaves you to code the unique bits of the problem. The best way to think about Gadget is that it's LOW CODE FOR DEVELOPERS. We believe that there's a certain way of thinking, modelling and coding that's necessary to build scalable applications. As such, we're not necessarily huge fans of the no-code movement as a whole, but there are certain aspects we like and we've tried to bring that to a developer audience.\n\nThis demo is ten minutes long. And I build a real, live app in that time. The alpha is open to anyone who wants to give us feedback and totally free. DM me if you're interested.

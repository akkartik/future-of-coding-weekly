Ted's asking for the OS to provide a framework for parts of documents that can be given mutable but persistent locations, akin to a desktop or bedroom floor. They can be moved around, they stay in one place unless moved around, and you can see where they moved from.\nI get to enjoy this exact mode of working when I edit video and audio. For instance, here (below) is a screenshot from the Orca podcast episode. At the bottom, in the clip editor, you see the full source audio recording. In the middle of the screen, in the main \"arrangement\" view, you see all the ways I've cut up and rearranged that source audio into the final product, stripping out some pauses where they felt bad, adding in pauses where they felt good, cutting out a tremendous amount of stuttering and false starts and tangents.\n\nWhen I'm editing thousand-line source files, or documentation, or blog posts, I often use copy-and-paste in a similar (but less richly supported) way \u2014\u00a0I keep a scratchpad document open next to my main document, and whenever I cut something but don't know where it's going, I paste it to the scratchpad. Nothing ever stays in the hidey hole, because that's a recipe for lost work. But I often find myself in the situation where I rearrange the document, leave it for a week, come back with fresh eyes.. and realize the flow of thoughts is worse than it was before. I suspect that what Ted is asking for would help with this, by allowing me to \"view things as they were\" with a little more interactivity than just undo/redo or version history.",

At the bottom, in the clip editor, you see the full source audio recording. In the middle of the screen, in the main \"arrangement\" view, you see all the ways I've cut up and rearranged that source audio into the final product, stripping out some pauses where they felt bad, adding in pauses where they felt good, cutting out a tremendous amount of stuttering and false starts and tangents.\n\nWhen I'm editing thousand-line source files, or documentation, or blog posts, I often use copy-and-paste in a similar (but less richly supported) way \u2014\u00a0I keep a scratchpad document open next to my main document, and whenever I cut something but don't know where it's going, I paste it to the scratchpad. Nothing ever stays in the hidey hole, because that's a recipe for lost work. But I often find myself in the situation where I rearrange the document, leave it for a week, come back with fresh eyes.. and realize the flow of thoughts is worse than it was before. I suspect that what Ted is asking for would help with this, by allowing me to \"view things as they were\" with a little more interactivity than just undo/redo or version history."

I agree with <@UEQ6M68H0> that external control of apps has disappeared mainly because today\u2019s dominant players can afford not to offer it and have a commercial interest in creating silos and walled gardens. But we also lack the infrastructure, technical but most of all social and legal, for a market of small to mid-size players to develop interoperable components of non-trivial complexity. Software development is all bottom-up. You take existing stuff (dependencies) and build on them. There is no top-down design as it\u2019s done for material goods, based on markets for standard components and subcontractors that produce to an agreed-on specification. Therefore complex software assemblies are fragile unless they come from the giants who control their full software stack.\n",

But we also lack the infrastructure, technical but most of all social and legal, for a market of small to mid-size players to develop interoperable components of non-trivial complexity. Software development is all bottom-up. You take existing stuff (dependencies) and build on them. There is no top-down design as it\u2019s done for material goods, based on markets for standard components and subcontractors that produce to an agreed-on specification. Therefore complex software assemblies are fragile unless they come from the giants who control their full software stack.\n"

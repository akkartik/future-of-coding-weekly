                "text": "A Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) is a program designed to support self-directed education. Sugata Mitra, an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his Hole in the Wall experiments. Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and \"research since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves.\" Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the School in the Cloud project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding \"Granny\" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs.",

My worst nightmare is things that are highly configurable but in a \"closed\" way, e.g. a lot of creative software like Photoshop, Blender, Unreal Engine etc.\n\nFor example, in Sublime Text, the Build command will basically just execute a string you provide as a command. This is so much more appealing to me to than trying to configure Eclipse. The \"connection\" in Sublime Text is more \"raw\"."

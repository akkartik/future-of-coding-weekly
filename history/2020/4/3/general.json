The complexities inside banking/ACH/creditcards is insane. Honestly, it\u2019s the definition of insanity. Banks and cards are very difficult to work with because their tech is absolute shit. So APIs that make that easy\u2026 very valuable.  (Happy to share more of my experience there, just DM me)\n\nI don\u2019t think the finance/fintech note is exclusive or even a bias. It\u2019s more business as a whole. Consumers rather use interfaces, so I would be comfortable drawing the line of a bias towards businesses. API tools are all about ease of use: providing a better UX than dealing with the terrible tech underneath it. Think of API\u2019s as more access to information than a programming interface. If you are intereseted in building an API as a business I have a friend, Travis, that would love to chat more building the company Saasify.sh who has a lot of experience in this topic.",

The complexities inside banking/ACH/creditcards is insane. Honestly, it\u2019s the definition of insanity. Banks and cards are very difficult to work with because their tech is absolute shit. So APIs that make that easy\u2026 very valuable.  (Happy to share more of my experience there, just DM me)\n\nI don\u2019t think the finance/fintech note is exclusive or even a bias. It\u2019s more business as a whole. Consumers rather use interfaces, so I would be comfortable drawing the line of a bias towards businesses. API tools are all about ease of use: providing a better UX than dealing with the terrible tech underneath it. Think of API\u2019s as more access to information than a programming interface. If you are intereseted in building an API as a business I have a friend, Travis, that would love to chat more building the company Saasify.sh who has a lot of experience in this topic."

In my guest blog post (<https://malleable.systems/blog/2020/04/01/the-most-successful-malleable-system-in-history/>) I point out one of them, which is responsibility for the overall system. If you let users mess around with it, you can't then let them sue the original authors if it breaks. And if you let people distribute their own add-ons, that makes three parties among which responsibility must be divided in some way.\n\nSize and complexity are also an issue, but less so if you get away from the assumption of a software _stack_ implying vertical dependencies. Replace this by a network of modular subsystems with reasonably stable APIs, and you can have malleability for the whole system and for each subsystem. Do it recursively and you can perhaps scale to really big and complex stuff (though I am obviously speculating here).\n\nSure, we have no technology for building systems out of modular subsystems. That remains to be done.",

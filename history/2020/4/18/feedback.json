One thing I find interesting with this approach, is that it forces you (as a designer of a programming system) to have high level programming constructs as close as possible to the \"end-user\" programmer interests. I mean, often in general purpose language, you have some kind of surrounding code (preparing variable, accessing data, etc., sometime boilerplate code) which is not that necessary. As programmers it can be part of our job to make this code less necessary and to produce higher abstractions, but with a system like the one in the video, you are forced to have these very high level constructs (and I understand it is at the core of the design of StoryScript).",

So, taking a disclaimer here that the structure of ideas on this might be incoherent as I don't have enough clarity as I didn't go deep enough into the thick of these things and then zoom out to get the birds view picture. Most of the stuff that I list here are the ones that I have either bookmarked or found to be interesting during my spelunking. But I emphasis that I haven't personally chased down to comprehend their proper form, function and/or how they relate with each other.\n\nFirst up there seems to be a wikipedia article here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation> which has some interesting models and a related section with further ones.\n\nBut using the structure you have provided as a baseline, one thing missing there is rewriting ideas used by Post / Semi-Thue systems (which I think comes under the abstract rewriting systems category in Wiki's classification).\n\nHere are some links:\n1/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_canonical_system>\n2/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Thue_system>\n3/ This looks like a good paper to read about this: <https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82345385.pdf>\n\nNext up is the idea of formalizing what computation is. Most of my understanding comes from this well written blogpost by Ron Pressler: <https://pron.github.io/posts/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation>\nIf you are academically inclined and willing to dig down, there is some deeply funny stuff happening with Chomsky hierarchy of formal grammars, automata, data structures (chain, tree, lattice, graphs), algorithms and their complexity classes. There are some non-trivial highly regular deep structure there.\n\nThere are these books if you want to chase this rabbit holes:\n1/ Computation: Finite and Infinite Models \u2014 <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326791.Computation>\n2/ Understanding Computation: <https://computationbook.com/>\n3/ Nature of Computation: <http://nature-of-computation.org/>\n4/ Computability and Complexity: <http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~neil/comp2book2007/book-whole.pdf>\n5/ Models of Computation: <https://cs.brown.edu/people/jsavage/book/pdfs/ModelsOfComputation.pdf>\n6/ Models of Computation and Formal Languages: <https://www.amazon.com/Models-Computation-Formal-Languages-R-Gregory/dp/019510983X/>\n\nOne thing (I could be wrong here) about the above books I think is that they operate under the mainstream consensus of agreeing that Church-Turing Thesis formalizes what computation is. Though Alan Turing and Church's hypothesis is said to have given a bounded form to the mechanism of computation, there are ideas like that of Robert Rosen proposing that Church Turing Thesis is wrong and can't possibly stand as a model for all computation physically realizable.\u00a0There is something called epistemic cut and other ideas which I haven't been able to unbundle yet.\n\nHere are some relevant reading materials if these rabbit holes intrigue you:\nRobert Rosen's paper: <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02477996.pdf>\nIs Church-Turing thesis true? <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00976283>\nSurvey on these ideas: <https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~cgutierr/papers/computabilityLife.pdf>\nEpistemic cut: <https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27049>\n\nSignificant idea about Pattee\u2019s work seems to be the interplay of duals like adjoints in Category Theory (I am punching above my weight class here):\n&gt; _\"There are two realities to this thing. Just like light is a wave and a particle at the same time. Information and construction, structure and function, are irreducible properties of the same physical object that exist in different layers with different protocols.\"_",

Thanks gang!\n\nMy thinking on this \"spectrum\" was to rank these models of computation in terms of how \"easy\" it'd be to build a little machine that implemented them. Totally subjective, really vague, just a fun way of getting a little closer to these concepts that are normally quite theoretical and at a remove.\n\nI was thinking, like... Junkyard Wars style, or like MythBusters... where you have a fairly well-stocked workshop for making hobbyist electrical things... how tricky would it be to build a machine that implements a particular model of computation. Rank them in that order.\n\nSo, like... Sure, von Neumann is conceptually simpler than a Turing Machine. All you need for vN is a lot of wires and a power source, whereas for a TM you need something like magnetic tape, and a tape reader, and something that can adjust the movement of the tape based on what's read, etc. But, on the other hand, you can probably salvage a cassette deck and use some sort of amplitude modulation as a binary encoding with nothing more than what you'd find in a Radio Shack of yore, so to me that _feels_ more doable. Whereas wiring up your own vN machine.. you've all seen the pictures of what it looks like to do, say, an 8 bit ALU just using wires and relays. Bonkers!",

Thanks gang!\n\nMy thinking on this \"spectrum\" was to rank these models of computation in terms of how \"easy\" it'd be to build a little machine that implemented them. Totally subjective, really vague, just a fun way of getting a little closer to these concepts that are normally quite theoretical and at a remove.\n\nI was thinking, like... Junkyard Wars style, or like MythBusters... where you have a fairly well-stocked workshop for making hobbyist electrical things... how tricky would it be to build a machine that implements a particular model of computation. Rank them in that order.\n\nSo, like... Sure, von Neumann is conceptually simpler than a Turing Machine. All you need for vN is a lot of wires and a power source, whereas for a TM you need something like magnetic tape, and a tape reader, and something that can adjust the movement of the tape based on what's read, etc. But, on the other hand, you can probably salvage a cassette deck and use some sort of amplitude modulation as a binary encoding with nothing more than what you'd find in a Radio Shack of yore, so to me that "

Maybe public documentation will be made available for the release version. It's not that different from any other version of K, at least at first glance. It has a better syntax for dictionary literals, and better support for database tables, and some of the operator syntax has been rearranged. For example, dyadic ^ is now \"cut\" instead of exponentiation, which breaks some of the examples on Wikipedia. It certainly is not an OOP language, since it has no concept of objects, classes, inheritance, or any of that. It certainly does have date and time values. The help mentions \"exp\" in a list of trancendental functions, so I assume that is exponentiation, although it isn't implemented.

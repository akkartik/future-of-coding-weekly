That could start with simply starting an open discussion here, and then having breakout discussions with those whose views and backgrounds aren\u2019t well represented here. And then forming positive actions for the community as a whole. It wouldn\u2019t be too much to do an additional diversity survey as an addendum to this rather than waiting a year. I would recommend to consult outside of this community to write such a survey. \n\nDiversity means different things in different contexts. There is a wealth of diversity here in some dimensions, and a dearth in other dimensions, gender being the most obvious one. The issue also is a broader sociopolitical one: the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities and oppression across society. This community can either be an ally towards justice by working actively to dismantle that, or it can continue in its bubble implicitly excluding everyone else from the \u201cfuture of coding\u201d conversation, and ignorant of its own biases and weaknesses.

That could start with simply starting an open discussion here, and then having breakout discussions with those whose views and backgrounds aren\u2019t well represented here. And then forming positive actions for the community as a whole. It wouldn\u2019t be too much to do an additional diversity survey as an addendum to this rather than waiting a year. I would recommend to consult outside of this community to write such a survey. \n\nDiversity means different things in different contexts. There is a wealth of diversity here in some dimensions, and a dearth in other dimensions, gender being the most obvious one. The issue also is a broader sociopolitical one: the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities and oppression across society. This community can either be an ally towards justice by working actively to dismantle that, or it can continue in its bubble implicitly excluding everyone else from the \u201cfuture of coding\u201d conversation, and ignorant of its own biases and weaknesses.

Not sure I understand the question.\n\nBut as far as I get it, your logic (observe, filter, map) is not UI related, so the UI could belong to any library , the logic is behind it. You could do that in Kotlin (Kotlin Flow), in Dart (RxDart and Freezed), in JS (Uhh RxJS &amp; Collections.JS if you wanna use a baked solution), most languages have their own implementation.",

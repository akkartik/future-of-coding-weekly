For the last eight years, we\u2019ve worked on the Webstrates (<https://www.webstrates.net>) software platform as a way to explore\nsoftware that\u2019s inherently malleable and collaborative. In our team, we\u2019ve\nworked on various iterations of tools for developing software with Webstrates\nand now we have something that we think is pretty neat, but we\u2019d love to get\nsome input from you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe programming challenge is to _*make a small multiplayer game where the players can change rules through programming*_ using our _Codestrates v2_ development platform. The challenge will run for a little less than three weeks from *June 10th to June 26th* ending with an online demo session *Friday the 26th at 15.30 CET*.\nThe programming challenge is open-ended, but expect to spend the equivalent of a couple of evenings to work on it. You can work on the challenge by yourself or in a group (all members should sign up). To participate, you are expected to have experience with Web development and JavaScript programming. We don\u2019t expect that you have experience with game development but it\u2019s fine if you do.\nWe assume games to be publicly shared under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) unless otherwise is agreed with you.\n\u00a0\nYou sign up for the challenge here: <https://www.survey-xact.dk/LinkCollector?key=HCPGJP41UK9J>\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Sign up before June 8th at the latest*.\n\u00a0\nIf you sign up we will contact you with further instructions, access to our\nsystem, and to a Slack workspace where all participants can chat and ask for\nhelp. You can at any time opt-out of the challenge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor us this challenge aims to:\n\u2022 assess the creative potential of the Webstrates &amp; Codestrates tools.\n\u2022 evaluate the usability and understandability of Codestrates &amp; Webstrates.\n\u2022 get input for the future development of the platform\n\u00a0\nFor you, it\u2019s an opportunity to contribute to science by playing with some software that hopefully inspires you and challenges you to think of software\ndifferently. We cannot compensate you for your time, but we can provide you\nwith an exciting experience.\n\u00a0\nOur goal is to publish the results of the study at an academic conference or\njournal.\n\u00a0\nFeel free to share this invitation personally to people you might believe are\ninterested, but we ask you kindly not to distribute it broadly, e.g., on social\nmedia or the like.\n\u00a0\nBest\nregards,\n\u00a0\nClemens Nylandsted Klokmose, PhD, Associate Professor\nBjarke Fog, PhD student\nDigital Design and Information Studies\nAarhus University\nDenmark",

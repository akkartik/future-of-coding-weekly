Firstly, I\u2019ve been working on a presentation about what problem Glance is attempting to solve, why that problem is worth solving, and it proposes a plan for how we can attempt to solve it. I plan to share this presentation within the next day or two. The second thing is that I have started investigating how to make a GUI for Glance, by which I mean a visual programming editor that will generate Haskell. Right now I\u2019m evaluating the GUI toolkit GTK because it has Haskell bindings. The existing Glance code creates diagrams using the Haskell diagrams library, and I should be able to render these diagrams in GTK using the Cairo or GTK backends for the diagrams library.\n<https://youtu.be/dU0rHwNXCig>",

At the very least, it's an existence proof that you can cover most kinds of input in a way that should allow everyone to scroll and zoom in a way that feels fairly comfortable.\n\nIf you do end up rummaging through this code and have questions, feel free to DM me if you want to keep the noise level in this thread low.",

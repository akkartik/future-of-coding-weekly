Swift used to be a pretty modest language, but is turning into a monster. Apple is pursuing a strategy of constant enhancement to the language perhaps so as to indirectly block Swift from stabilizing and becoming an Android platform language.  Not that there was much danger, because a great deal of the language is dictated by the Cocoa underpinnings of OSX API sets. At least it has a very tight spec; the old ObjectiveC language that Jobs used at NextStep lacked a manual, and the spec was \"whatever the compiler does\".

        "text": "People propose new languages all the time. The arguments in favor of the new languages often revolve around increased expressive power, or conciseness, or new buzzwords. But to businesses and government entities which provide most of the employment in the field, their overriding concern is for stability, and transferability. Time and time again, the industry consensus has been to select the worst, most verbose language available, that had the perception of being easy to understand. LISP, which permits, some would say encourages, very sneaky metalinguistic abstraction practices, is well known to be  \"write-only\" language, so regardless of its positive attributes has been shunned for 50 years (and probably rightly so). Python has crept up into the top 3 due to merit; it is reasonably compact, and reasonably easy to read.\n\nI used Modula-2 which was the 10 year later sequel to Pascal. It was superior to C in every single aspect except popularity. It generates faster, smaller more compact, more readable programs, and its feature set has 100% correspondence with C, and adds dozens of error-reducing compile-time and runtime checks against dumb errors like nil pointers, array bounds checks, and conversion errors. I could not get a single person to convert to Modula-2 in 20 years because everyone was in thrall to Microsoft's dominance. Whatever MS did was the law, and people were afraid to buck the behemoth's practices. Now i look back and see the probably close to 100,000 security patches that have had to be applied to MS's code base, all because stupid C doesn't have NIL pointer or runtime range checks. The amount of wasted time spend downloading and installing these patches, none of which would have been necessary had MS used a more robust language.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the people working as programmers many of which are paid by the hour, have a perverse incentive to use the most troublesome language available. Programming is one of the few fields where people are paid full wages to fix their own errors. A building contractor, when he screws up, often has to pay with free labor to fix their mistakes, while programmers typically earn 75%+ of their total income from fixing their own mistakes.

The arguments in favor of the new languages often revolve around increased expressive power, or conciseness, or new buzzwords. But to businesses and government entities which provide most of the employment in the field, their overriding concern is for stability, and transferability. Time and time again, the industry consensus has been to select the worst, most verbose language available, that had the perception of being easy to understand. LISP, which permits, some would say encourages, very sneaky metalinguistic abstraction practices, is well known to be  \"write-only\" language, so regardless of its positive attributes has been shunned for 50 years (and probably rightly so). Python has crept up into the top 3 due to merit; it is reasonably compact, and reasonably easy to read.\n\nI used Modula-2 which was the 10 year later sequel to Pascal. It was superior to C in every single aspect except popularity. It generates faster, smaller more compact, more readable programs, and its feature set has 100% correspondence with C, and adds dozens of error-reducing compile-time and runtime checks against dumb errors like nil pointers, array bounds checks, and conversion errors.

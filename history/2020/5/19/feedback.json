How you process and generate the data to send over - your application logic - is up to you though.\n\nSecond, you can really easily tap into the .NET ecosystem (<http://nuget.org|nuget.org>) for additional libraries if the need arises, I'm using SharpDX.XInput for gamepad support for instance.\n\nIf you don't know about vvvv gamma, then I suggest you check it out, even just to see how a visual language can be designed so its powers are fundamentally on par with its textual counterparts. <https://visualprogramming.net/>\n\nThe interface is using VL.Skia, vvvv's wrapper around SkiaSharp. It provides basic primitives, paths and text, grouping of draw calls into layers, transformations and a rudimentary notification system for handling user input so it is a kind of a slightly smarter canvas.\n\nWhen I started out, there was no GUI toolkit for VL so all the widgets are patched from primitives and those are then combined together in various ways. This I think allowed me to strike a very unique look and feel though, it's really closer to a game than a traditional IDE.\n\nNowadays there is Elementa, which is quite cool and has really extensive features with styling and all sorts of layouting. I'm considering porting all my widgets to its architecture eventually. It might benefit Sch\u00e9ma and maybe save me some time in the long run. But the widgets I made are so purpose-built to deal with the needs of my program so there is quite a gap in model handling, styling, etc. So I'm not sure if it would be the right step.",

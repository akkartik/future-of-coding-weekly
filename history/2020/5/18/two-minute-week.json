Orca does indeed schedule immediately, but those generated notes  are effectively played after a small delay when the arrive at whatever Synth you are using; you just don't notice.  It should be a similar situation here; and although I am testing far into the future, in reality I will probably be scheduling much more closely to 'now'.  I'm trying to plan a for a future containing a music generation language I've been working on, alongside Orca.   Although Orca is very fast, a music language may not be as fast.   I know, for example, that Sonic Pi has a delay of 250-&gt;500ms which is added to generated notes.   By scheduling a little bit into the future, there is I hope more time to generate and align notes correctly.  My sense is that i need this flexibility, but we will see.  Pattern languages also let you 'see' into the future, since you can run the pattern forward; so the concept of what is happening 'next' is something I want to at least be able to see.",

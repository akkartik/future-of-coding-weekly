Apparently somebody accidentally said \"Rosa only date shranks\", instead of \"Rosa only dated shrinks\". That is, they applied to \"make_past_tense()\" function to \"shrink\" instead of \"date\"!\n\nHofstadter mentions he has collected thousands of examples of errors like these (it's not clear if the \"filing cabinet\" he talks about is metaphorical or not).\n\nI think it might also be useful to collect programming errors in a similar way (maybe put on the wiki eventually). Patterns might start to emerge that are instructive to how people think about coding. These errors are quite precious because they become very rare once you have become fluent in the status quo.\n\nMost programming errors are of the type \"failed to understand the full consequences of my code\" or \"failed to consider all possible inputs\". These are the types of errors that pros make. I am more interested in the type of errors that beginners make, that might reveal friction between how they might naturally express themselves or understand, and how they are forced to by the language."

So instead of saying `obj.func()` you have to say `do obj.func()`, instead of `a = 123` you say `set a = 123`. The design tradeoff they made here is to make the implementation of the parser/compiler easier at the expense of an annoyance when using the language. In the context of the nand2tetris course this makes sense because the user of the language and the implementer of the compiler are both you, but if Jack was a real language this would be absurd.\n\nFinally, just because there will always be tradeoffs doesn't mean there aren't sometimes outright improvements.

In the context of the nand2tetris course this makes sense because the user of the language and the implementer of the compiler are both you, but if Jack was a real language this would be absurd.\n\nFinally, just because there will always be tradeoffs doesn't mean there aren't sometimes outright improvements. Leibniz's calculus notation is strictly better than Newton's, IMO."

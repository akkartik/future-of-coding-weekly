Well, mostly, in fact, I could discuss the part about text files, but I guess you only mean (or don't you? :slightly_smiling_face: ) it as an illustration, so I skip this discussion...\n\nAs for the context, I agree it is a very important aspect. It is which gives lots of inertia to what is happening and what we can change. And you have to be aware of that when you work on FoC projects. To use the cost function metaphor, we are at a local minimum. And all the social/technical/economic contexts explains why we are at this minimum. They are the force that pull us down to it.\n\nSo what is this local minimum? Is there other lower minima? Where are they? What is the path to go there? etc. And as Foc builders I agree with that we must know all this: the minima we want to reach and the path to go there. And you will do some compromises.\n\nAs an illustration, in my case, I identified that one context aspect of the current local minimum that is hard to go away for me, is the web plateforme. If I want to provide something that can be used by most of the people soon, I know the web plateforme is a very good fit. And even if it has lots of technical problems that I want to get rid of. So I decided to stick with this aspect of the current local minimum of \"the present of coding\" and choose to work on other aspects.\n\nHere is another illustration of how to be aware and how to deal with these context aspects that are local minima. It is about adoption and audience. Something about the social context that is very costly to \"move\", is the current \"programming audience\". It is very hard to change habits and well established \"standards\", even if there are problems with them you want to change (random concrete example that I encountered: bash scripting). So one very risky and difficult strategy is to decide not to target this audience first and hope it will be convinced later. So I guess I will try this strategy, I want to propose new programming tools that I know most of today programmers won't want to use, so I will first target new programmers, that are not bias by the current programming context. Then if things go well, keeping the good parts of what I will build, maybe current \"established\" programmers will use them. So it is an other way to be aware of the context and try to deal with it to build a FoC vision.",

                                "text": " ) it as an illustration, so I skip this discussion...\n\nAs for the context, I agree it is a very important aspect. It is which gives lots of inertia to what is happening and what we can change. And you have to be aware of that when you work on FoC projects. To use the cost function metaphor, we are at a local minimum. And all the social/technical/economic contexts explains why we are at this minimum. They are the force that pull us down to it.\n\nSo what is this local minimum? Is there other lower minima? Where are they? What is the path to go there? etc. And as Foc builders I agree with that we must know all this: the minima we want to reach and the path to go there. And you will do some compromises.\n\nAs an illustration, in my case, I identified that one context aspect of the current local minimum that is hard to go away for me, is the web plateforme. If I want to provide something that can be used by most of the people soon, I know the web plateforme is a very good fit. And even if it has lots of technical problems that I want to get rid of. So I decided to stick with this aspect of the current local minimum of \"the present of coding\" and choose to work on other aspects.\n\nHere is another illustration of how to be aware and how to deal with these context aspects that are local minima. It is about adoption and audience. Something about the social context that is very costly to \"move\", is the current \"programming audience\". It is very hard to change habits and well established \"standards\", even if there are problems with them you want to change (random concrete example that I encountered: bash scripting). So one very risky and difficult strategy is to decide not to target this audience first and hope it will be convinced later. So I guess I will try this strategy, I want to propose new programming tools that I know most of today programmers won't want to use, so I will first target new programmers, that are not bias by the current programming context. Then if things go well, keeping the good parts of what I will build, maybe current \"established\" programmers will use them. So it is an other way to be aware of the context and try to deal with it to build a FoC vision."

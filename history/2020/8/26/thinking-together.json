My typing was perhaps 10% better, but it was suddenly hard for me to jump between different devices. Given that typing speed is completely irrelevant to productivity for everyone except perhaps professional writers, I\u2019ve never tried any weird keyboards since. There are 100 things a person can optimize to receive better returns than a new keyboard layout. For example: a note-taking methodology, diet and exercise, or social media rationing."

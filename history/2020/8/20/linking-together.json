It always felt like hardware interfaces should be implemented as a blackboard system where devices push events and consume events and nothing else (similar to his \u201cjust have ring buffers\u201d idea). Interop is trivial at that point. Creating new devices is just pushing new events that some other system looks for. The events can be easily versioned and so on.

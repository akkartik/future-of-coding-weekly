        "text": "I tend to be bearish on this whole idea of a \"Von Neumann bottleneck\".\n\n* There have been many, many attempts to create processors that operate on graphs. One of the more recent ones was by my research group in grad school 10 or so years ago: <https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips>. But see also Dataflow architectures (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture>), and MIT's Raw processor (<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/raw>). While it's possible we're just one breakthrough away from making it work, it is an Open Research Problem.\n* Hardware people know what they're doing, far more than us software people. Whether that's because they're Superior Human Beings, or because their domain is easier, you seek to make hardware more like software at your peril. Imagine having to fix a security vulnerability in a chip instead of a compiler.\n* Hardware has less open source, and you seek to implement layers of software in hardware at your peril. Imagine having to convince your processor supplier of the value of open source. Imagine having to create a new programming language in nights and weekends _in hardware_. Now ask yourself why you would want to ask others to do something that hobbyists wouldn't do, to put up with a less malleable medium. The best ideas in computing have come from hobbyists. I want a more inclusive future, not less.\n* Python is Python only because all the hard stuff has native libraries that work with existing processors. If you plan to migrate those to pure Python, that gives up much of the benefit of using an existing language with a large install base. Might as well use a better language.\n* The term \"von neumann bottleneck\" is fundamentally about improving performance. Improving performance isn't in my top 10 major problems facing the future of software.",

In some cases these textual representations are also suitable for input to the Wolfram Language. But in other cases they are intended just to be looked at, or to be exported to other programs, rather than to be used as input to the Wolfram Language. &amp;quot;Low-Level Input and Output Rules&amp;quot; discusses how you can create your own output forms. You should realize however that in communicating with external programs it is often better to use the Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol (WSTP) to send expressions directly than to generate a textual representation for these expressions.",

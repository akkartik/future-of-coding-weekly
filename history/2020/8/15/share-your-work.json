Critique is great, criticism is not.\n\n\u2022 If your work is more about programming as practiced today than programming of a hypothetical _much better_ future, please share it in <#C01932BJGE8|present-company>. This is a fuzzy boundary that we'll more clearly establish over the coming months, so if in doubt, by all means post here.\n\u2022 Blog posts about your own FoC work are welcome here.

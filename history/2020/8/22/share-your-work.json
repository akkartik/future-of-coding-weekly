I really like Visual Studio Code, but for me it lacks the killer feature which makes Visual Studio (VC) better in my eyes.  In VC you can hit 'CTRL+,' (comma) and get a search box.  But the search is completely general, and fuzzy matched.  VC will search symbols, file names, function names, class names, etc. etc.  Effectively this somewhat 'hidden' feature lets you jump to _anything_ you need while programming - instantly.  It is perfect because:\n\u2022 Fingers never leave the keyboard, it takes < 1 second to jump\n\u2022 Fuzzy matching means I can just type fragments\n\u2022 Searches everything relevant.\nThe built-in search in Visual Studio Code unfortunately searches for _either_ symbols _or_ files depending on which command you invoke.  There is no combined search.  And in fact, I have not seen the same thing as VC in any other editor.",

The TL;DR of the study provided in Heath and Heath's _Made to Stick_ conveys the point well enough:\n\n&gt; _Tappers received a list of twenty-five well-known songs, such as \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d and \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener (by knocking on a table). The listener\u2019s job was to guess the song, based on the rhythm being tapped._\n&gt; _The listener\u2019s job in this game is quite difficult. Over the course of Newton\u2019s experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs: 3 out of 120._\n&gt; _But here\u2019s what made the result worthy of a dissertation in psychology. Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, Newton asked the tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. They predicted that the odds were 50 percent. *The tappers got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they were getting their message across 1 time in 2.* Why?_\n&gt; _When a tapper taps, she is hearing the song in her head. Go ahead and try it for yourself \u2014 tap out \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to avoid hearing the tune in your head. Meanwhile, the listeners can\u2019t hear that tune \u2014 all they can hear is a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre Morse Code._\n&gt; _In the experiment, tappers are flabbergasted at how hard the listeners seem to be working to pick up the tune. Isn\u2019t the song obvious? The tappers\u2019 expressions, when a listener guesses \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d for \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d are priceless: How could you be so stupid?_\n&gt; _It\u2019s hard to be a tapper. The problem is that tappers have been given knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine what it\u2019s like to lack that knowledge. When they\u2019re tapping, they can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for the listeners to hear isolated taps rather than a song. This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has \u201ccursed\u201d us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can\u2019t readily re-create our listeners\u2019 state of mind._\nWhen we try to communicate something to a (virtual) room full of intelligent people operating in good faith and find that they cannot understand what we're saying, we have a choice: either accept that we haven't said our piece in a way that successfully translates the knowledge in our head -- which is _necessarily_ much larger than the message we have transmitted -- or we can blame the listeners for our own failure. One way leads to effective communication and positive relationships, the other one to being the same kind of asshole I was in the cautionary tale with which I started this message.",

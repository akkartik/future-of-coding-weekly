Nothing wrong with any of that, but none of it feels relevant to this group, where the goal is thoughtful appreciation rather than rapid action. (Right?)\n\nI'm not sure what the answer is. Maybe we need something more like Science Fair? Put up your shingle for a predetermined hour, hack on your project if nobody shows up. If somebody shows up you give them your schtick. If it's someone who's already heard the schtick, maybe you answer their questions. Or maybe they don't have questions, they just wanna watch you hack. Or if your buddy shows up, you pair. Most importantly, anybody who doesn't care about your project knows what time to claim a prior engagement for.",

I LOVE this idea, but after using it for so long, it feels so obvious. I have no idea how else I would solve the problem. If someone was reading this, why wouldn't they jump out of their seat? Isn't this so great it doesn't need explaination? Of course it does. And I need to develop a better sense for the reader's mindset to make more valuable content.",

If they had done that it would have created a virtual OS that would have permitted all the languages to easily move to that new universal OS. Instead, JS still rules, and WebAsm is for async heavy computation. Sure you can implement some complex back-and-forth system, but that defeats the whole purpose of getting closer to the metal. If Google &amp; co. let other languages in, it could well lessen their control of the ecosystem.

All of us JS-haters were hoping for a clean virtual machine with direct API access to the BIOS which would be the DOM. If they had done that it would have created a virtual OS that would have permitted all the languages to easily move to that new universal OS. Instead, JS still rules, and WebAsm is for async heavy computation. Sure you can implement some complex back-and-forth system, but that defeats the whole purpose of getting closer to the metal. If Google & co. let other languages in, it could well lessen their control of the ecosystem. At present the V8 engine reigns supreme; it is an exceptional performing piece of code, but also super complex."

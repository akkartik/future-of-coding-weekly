I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out.",

I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out."

I think what I\u2019m getting at is \u2014 what is a specific _task_ involving this kind of understanding? e.g. a hypothetical task is \u201cI need to understand how many ms elapse from the start of the tick to when my gameplay logic runs\u201d, which requires understanding OoO/subsystem dependencies, presumably.\n\nI\u2019m being a little pedantic here because understanding how to provide cognitive support has to start with a task. e.g. when evaluating whether to use a bar chart vs. pie chart to display some data, you don\u2019t ask \u201cwhich is better\u201d, you ask \u201cwhich is better when a person is trying to find the maximum value in my dataset\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s a high-level task taxonomy from \u201cProgram Comprehension During Software Maintenance and Evolution\u201d.

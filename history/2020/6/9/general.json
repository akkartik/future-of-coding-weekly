I've done \"tone it down\" comments (in the form of \"this is drifting off-topic; let me repeat the initial discussion prompt\") here-and-there in other threads. It tends not to work. This thread is a bit different, though, as it's not just off topic. In this case, we have one person saying _I don't see any racism_, surrounded by people saying _I do_. In the current cultural moment, it is entirely not the time to push the _I don't see it, so it doesn't exist_ argument. If you don't know about the pay gaps, the glass ceilings, the double standards, the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias#Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination|algorithmic bias>\u2026 please go elsewhere to learn about those things. This thread was meant to be a place for people who are already past the _7 stages of white grief_ (to speak very crassly about something serious \u2014 sorry) and are ready to engage on the level of _here are papers about critical race theory_ and start working on _how do we fix this here in our own practice?_\n\nWill came in at a very advanced level, and we haven't managed to meet him at that level. Can we do that? <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1591617796052000?thread_ts=1591498636.036100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL|I tried>, and I'd love to see some others try too.\n\n(And re: representation in countries outside the USA \u2014 that's a very interesting consideration, it it does serve as an interesting _counterpoint_ [in the musical sense] to what's happening in the USA right now. But please be aware that some folks might see it as a _counterargument,_ and that might be hurtful or a distraction. The problem in the USA, the problem of interest right now due to the cultural moment, isn't just about, say, the relative percentage of various races employed in tech. It's a far broader and deeper issue. I hope that enough of us are aware of the scope of that issue and are able to think about how to address it. That's the conversation Will set up, and that's the conversation we should be having in this thread. If you'd like to discuss other facets of the intersection of race and tech, I'll meet you in a new thread.)",

One of the things I have learned about being productive as a programmer is that the code you don't write is often vastly more important than the code you do write. Sometimes ecosystems of tools and blocks that you can take apart are actually just code being for itself. Maybe we don't need to solve the \"standard ways for software-pieces to talk to each other\". Maybe we can define or architect that problem away altogether.",

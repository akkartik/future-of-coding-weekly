Docker et al is abused, true, but you are free not to use it, along with whatever other hairy mud jenga towers of complexity you may want to avoid *cough* systemd *cough*. I find that generally, among people I meet, the people the most enthusiastic about docker, etc are the ones that are the least comfortable with their package manager. You can have much simpler systems by just using packages and services, rather than containers. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that it's been a trend among programming languages to have utterly unholy build processes, whose brittleness make it hard to package things\u2014but if you can't build the software in question, you can't patch it, and you probably shouldn't be using it in a container either. This issue isn't really the fault of any system in particular but rather of programmer trends, with programs like web browsers setting trends (and records) with their compilation resource usage and dependency chains.",

I find that generally, among people I meet, the people the most enthusiastic about docker, etc are the ones that are the least comfortable with their package manager. You can have much simpler systems by just using packages and services, rather than containers. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that it's been a trend among programming languages to have utterly unholy build processes, whose brittleness make it hard to package things\u2014but if you can't build the software in question, you can't patch it, and you probably shouldn't be using it in a container either. This issue isn't really the fault of any system in particular but rather of programmer trends, with programs like web browsers setting trends (and records) with their compilation resource usage and dependency chains."

But a very interesting discussion started at the end of the week makes me want to show something else (see <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1594276999116700> and thanks <@UC2A2ARPT> for starting it :slightly_smiling_face: ).\n\nIn this video I use Scratch to show a quick and dirty example of a user that \"extends\" Scratch by creating some new visual \"programming material\" (term coined by <@U8A5MS6R1> in the above discussion, thanks Shalabh :slightly_smiling_face: ) that is more expressive for the programming task at hand. The time was missing (two minutes is really very short!) to actually show the Scratch code that defines the behavior of the new visual programming material, but I am not sure it is the point here (but of course I can provide some screenshots/video of it if asked).\n\nThis is a key idea for what I want to work on in the future. Giving (some) users the ability to create new visual programming material/artifacts/representations is an important part of my vision for the future of programming.\n\n<https://archive.org/details/ogadaki_foc_tmw_2>",

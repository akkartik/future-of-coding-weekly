Taking it was a revelatory experience, and offered me a sort of \"everything all at once\" frame of mind that I can now tap into whenever I need.\n\nI'd rank it up there with (say) acting in plays and travel, as experiences which are accessible only to very fortunate people, which can offer profound awareness of life and humanity (though do not guarantee it, of course).",

Taking it was a revelatory experience, and offered me a sort of \"everything all at once\" frame of mind that I can now tap into whenever I need.\n\nI'd rank it up there with (say) acting in plays and travel, as experiences which are accessible only to very fortunate people, which can offer profound awareness of life and humanity (though do not guarantee it, of course)."

But on the other hand, it's not exactly like you are building your language paradigms out of the pieces unix provides. Unix is just there to facilitate reading, writing, and executing. So in that sense, it might even be too far to that latter extreme of the spectrum.\n\nI think the VPRI connection was the best fit, so far, for what I have in mind.

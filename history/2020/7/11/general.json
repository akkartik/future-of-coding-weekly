The Apple pencil is different technology than Wacom, and doesn't have tilt compensation. But it is pretty good, and much cheaper than the Wacom. Apple has the ability to bump the refresh rate up on their iPad Pro tablets, an obscure feature that few realize exists. So far, nobody has beaten the Wacom Cintiq system for overall artistic feel.

School curricula or marriage laws are no less purposely shaped social devices than road networks.\n2. A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence.\n3. Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon. To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools, the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and expectations of others.

I soon found small issues one after another but that ultimately added so much up that I decided not to use it. And now Gtoolkit seems to bring in the smalltalk approach which gives me as a User ( smalltalk able programmer) the ability to mold the tool in ways which I need. Runar from unison was also in the loop. I would love to have a more functional language like scala , unison or clojure (see early efforts cloxp) available in such an environment."

The current way of building also makes such remixing quite hard to support on all sides (original team and remixers). The Basman and Tchernavskij paper \"What Lies in the Path of the Revolution\" (<https://malleable.systems/catalog/#revolution>) goes into more detail on the many layers of obstacles currently in the way. I believe it will be a very long time before product teams wake up to the power of remixing, so I am instead building tools to take back control and enable changing and remixing without the original team's involvement.",

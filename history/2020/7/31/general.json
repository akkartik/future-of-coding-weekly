I think in the capitalism thread we had arguments stating that culture is largely an emergent phenomenon. As such our \u201ccurrent\u201d state of civilisation is , well , our best effort and a aggregation of all that had come before. Even now for a single person to perceive the culture of science is quite a difficult adventure. (Though I would it really recommend it to Steven diehl- but I think he somehow likes to remain in the _doing_ science space rather then _introspecting_ science space ) So as a technology for potential impact on culture crypto currencies have huge potential to be used for actual a better  and more positive live. And it this that I miss from Stevens criticism. That he acknowledges that crypto _could_ have positive impact. I agree with him that \u201cnon-productive\u201d assets are a failure of the economic system. I also agree with him that most crypto projects are sadly located near that realm. ",

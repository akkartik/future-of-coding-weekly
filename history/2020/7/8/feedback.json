But when I plug a proportional in an editor I have a global negative feeling without knowing precisely why. Until now. You are absolutely right: it is because that depends on the part of the code. And punctuations are very important and a proportional font make them too dense. Maybe an other way to achieve the same expressiveness is to use a proportional font everywhere and change the weight and the margin around punctuation characters? Or maybe design a font that provides some specific character for code punctuations?",

But when I plug a proportional in an editor I have a global negative feeling without knowing precisely why. Until now. You are absolutely right: it is because that depends on the part of the code. And punctuations are very important and a proportional font make them too dense. Maybe an other way to achieve the same expressiveness is to use a proportional font everywhere and change the weight and the margin around punctuation characters? Or maybe design a font that provides some specific character for code punctuations?"

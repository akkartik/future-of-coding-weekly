I don't show it in the vid, but you can make different named patterns and play different synths at the same time.\nIn extempore you disable a pattern by using a different operator, I copied that by adding a ! after the pat command.\nIn the video I stop/start stuff because I haven't yet added the code to have the pattern wait for the next cycle before updating itself.

I read the K&R C book and various others that year (including one that had an Alice in Wonderland theme throughout; I no longer remember the title, but I really enjoyed that one). But still without access to a computer.\n\nI was pretty good at Math and Physics in high school, but it was pretty clear by the end of my sophomore year that computers were the thing for me: I never fell asleep in front of a computer the way I fell asleep over my textbooks for other subjects. And the feeling of flow was intensely pleasurable. In my junior year there was a contest to build an AI for a boardgame, and I won it by implementing A* search. So it seems clear that I must have had a few hundred hours of practice in that first year."

Align all our metrics and system optimization on the one constraint a flat world hasn't made disappear: neighbourhoods. We all live somewhere. Design success in one neighbourhood, and scale it to neighbourhoods. Ignore other metrics.\nAlong the way, I'm sure we'll get to test drive some pretty nifty tech solutions. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:",

Here's what I'm thinking we could do, as a 5-part plan:\n\n*1.* *Rename <#C5T9GPWFL|general> to #questions-and-ideas*\n\nThis is the channel for thinking out loud, asking questions, sharing ideas, brainstorming. Not for links, but otherwise identical to how we've been using <#C5T9GPWFL|general>.\n\n*2. Rename <#C5U3SEW6A|random> to #off-topic*\n\nThis is the channel for things that aren't immediately related to the future of coding, but that would still be interesting to our community.\n\n*3. Rename <#CCL5VVBAN|feedback> to #your-work*\n\n<#CCL5VVBAN|feedback> is great to have, but I feel like it is ever so slightly too narrow in focus, and the renaming would make it broader. This channel would be the place to share whatever you're working on. Ask for specific types of feedback if you want it, or just share your latest blog post, newsletter, appearance on an (inferior, competing) podcast, etc. to reach our community as an audience and harvest fresh high-fives.\n\n*4. Create a new #stimulating-links channel*\n\nThis is the other half of how we've been using <#C5T9GPWFL|general>. We'd use this channel to post FoC-relevant links to articles, videos, tweets, books, etc. made by other people outside our community.\n\n*5. Update the set of default channels*\n\nThe default channels for new members will be:\n\n\u2022 <#CC2JRGVLK|introductions>\n\u2022 <#CEXED56UR|meta>\n\u2022 #questions-and-ideas\n\u2022 #off-topic\n\u2022 #stimulating-links\n\u2022 <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week>\n\u2022 #your-work\nThere are a bunch of other channels not included in the default set, to keep new members from being overwhelmed. Ignoring the location-based/meetup channels, the remaining non-defaults are:\n\n\u2022 <#CFQUMT7M3|1-on-1s>\n\u2022 <#CLYCGTCPL|end-user-programming> \n\u2022 <#C0133ED5811|functional-programming> \n\u2022 <#CE1R695T7|graphics> \n\u2022 <#CGMJ7323Z|jobs> \n\u2022 <#CEZ6QTHL1|music>\nNote that every channel, default and non-default, now starts with a unique letter of the alphabet. This should hopefully cut down on folks posting to <#CE1R695T7|graphics> instead of <#C5T9GPWFL|general> (which totally happens).\n\nLet me know what you think of this plan.",

Here is a graph of the raw and inflation adjusted University of California budget. Do you see a decline lately? Nope, just keeps going up and up. Some UC administrators have 8 figure salaries, and fly in private jets.  If anything, higher education in America is decadent, and out of touch with reality. All scientific evidence on education shows that the most bang for the buck happens before the age of 8, and that college, which used to be about learning to shoot pool and drink beer has never justified the outrageous funding it currently receives.\n\nShe mentions all sorts of problems, without mentioning price/performance. Too busy pursuing social justice to measure if the universities' core mission, which is to educate people, is being done in an effective or frugal manner.\n\nWhatever happened to the concern for the quality of the graduates being produced?  Shouldn't that be the #1 concern? I have deep reservations about the quality of programmers being produced in the schools. Some of them can't program their way out of a paper bag.",

                                "text": "Amy Ko's article is nonsense. She boldly claims that public university funding is in dramatic decline since Reagan. Here is a graph of the raw and inflation adjusted University of California budget. Do you see a decline lately? Nope, just keeps going up and up. Some UC administrators have 8 figure salaries, and fly in private jets.  If anything, higher education in America is decadent, and out of touch with reality. All scientific evidence on education shows that the most bang for the buck happens before the age of 8, and that college, which used to be about learning to shoot pool and drink beer has never justified the outrageous funding it currently receives.\n\nShe mentions all sorts of problems, without mentioning price/performance. Too busy pursuing social justice to measure if the universities' core mission, which is to educate people, is being done in an effective or frugal manner.\n\nWhatever happened to the concern for the quality of the graduates being produced?  Shouldn't that be the #1 concern? I have deep reservations about the quality of programmers being produced in the schools. Some of them can't program their way out of a paper bag."

With the large influx of students interested in CS due to it being trendy, the degree meaning has degraded. I met many developers who are dipl. ing. and yet are junior level mindset because they learned to optimise for learning to pass the curriculum, not to learn.\n\nComing from a country where higher education is free if you are a regular student and you \u201cpay as you fail\u201d - it is a great solution, but it yields a huge diploma inflation. Everyone has a university degree, most do optimised learning just to pass, colleges love it because they get more money from the gov and more students, students love it because they all get diplomas easily. The academy became a super-slow turtle where people join as they graduate for a \u201cdoctorate\u201d, yielding them like 2.5x median salary and having them work on useless stuff with their mentors (like, we\u2019re analyzing bitcoin transactions to see how much total volume there was last year). Dozens of them drip in per college year, rarely anyone returns to the private sector. Some professors have monetized it by having students work on stuff that is relevant to companies they partner/work with so students get hired there and teachers get a comission.\n\nIn the end, the lack of quality graduates is showing in the industry.\n\n\nRe: Amy Ko\u2019s article\n\nTotally agree, sexism and elitism are prevalent in CS. I\u2019m glad to see more women in CS classrooms, because having just 2-3% of the classroom being women was causing a quite toxic culture. In the last 8-9ish years since I started/dropped college, worked, held talks on unis, I\u2019ve seen quite an increase here and I can say that the working culture changed to waaaay better and way less \u201cbro-like\u201d. I cannot speak much about racism from experience since we have a really low percentage of non-white people in our country, but by looking at the outside world, I see why racism is quite in play.\n\nBut yeah, Academia has a serious issues with gatekeeping - and it\u2019s broken bottom up - not open for the most intellectualy curious, but reserved for those who can endure to finance themselves that long and who will gladly jump through the hoops and play politics.  And the idea that we don\u2019t need liberal arts is so self-absorbed - programming is an art and it impacts and changes our society quite a lot. I\u2019d say we get quite a lot of problems due to engineering - engineers usually have more stricter and boundary/box making mindsets. Not saying it\u2019s bad, but it doesn\u2019t fit the artist culture of programming and now the culture is growing up and rejecting the engineer label",

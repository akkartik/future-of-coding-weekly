Just like how you can select some text and then drag and drop it to rearrange the text, if you make + and * a block like the operands, they would be amenable for drag and drop too. Say you drag a + from a certain operation and then drop it to an operation where there is a division and you will get to interactively explore what such things result in.\n\nI recommend such an interaction under the notion that to pan around on the canvas, users might already reach out for their mouse. So letting some tinkering with the mouse available might also be helpful."

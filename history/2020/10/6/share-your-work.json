And to be able to reverse the transformation, it's necessary to have stored information (mostly object ids) from the initial transformation.\n\nAlso, with each transfer I've found it necessary to augment the data with some assumed information on each transformation, and I'm not sure it's possible to reverse without some dataloss. I'm also not sure I can reverse the changes with a single \"lens\" as some transformations aren't reversible.\n\nNot sure if that's useful, but regardless of whether it's possible to do with or without dataloss, I think this research is great and will be a big step forward to in integrating services.

And to be able to reverse the transformation, it's necessary to have stored information (mostly object ids) from the initial transformation.\n\nAlso, with each transfer I've found it necessary to augment the data with some assumed information on each transformation, and I'm not sure it's possible to reverse without some dataloss. I'm also not sure I can reverse the changes with a single \"lens\" as some transformations aren't reversible.\n\nNot sure if that's useful, but regardless of whether it's possible to do with or without dataloss, I think this research is great and will be a big step forward to in integrating services. I look forward to seeing where this goes!"

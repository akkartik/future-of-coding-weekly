Beyond that point, it becomes net negative, though this can be hidden for some time by debt spending and eventually money printing until economic collapse. \n\nTo test if your country is an example of this, ask what would happen if central banks stopped printing money to buy your government\u2019s bonds or reducing reserve ratios to allow banks to effectively do the same.",

Socialism attempts to invert this and collectivize production by removing the organizational ecosystem of markets, some more so and some less. \n\nWhen services are limited to those that cannot be more efficiently produced otherwise, this can be net positive. Beyond that point, it becomes net negative, though this can be hidden for some time by debt spending and eventually money printing until economic collapse. \n\nTo test if your country is an example of this, ask what would happen if central banks stopped printing money to buy your government\u2019s bonds or reducing reserve ratios to allow banks to effectively do the same."

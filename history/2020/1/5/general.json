He also mentions a usual approach would be to have 12 files for each module with functions grouped by how they relate to each other, likely causing different files to have a different number of functions.\n\nThis reminds me of Christopher Alexander\u2019s fundamental properties of wholeness, in particular the one called Layers of Scale.

There's no zero sum game being played by translation software and language learning software. People fail just as hard as technological systems when their jobs become too complex. And burdening someone with the knowledge of video conferencing network protocols doesn't make them less angry about dropped calls.\n\nIt's certainly a failure of the way user-centered design is practiced that designers so often neglect a person's need to be empowered to learn, a person's need to be resilient in the case of failure, and a person's need to understand the consequences of their actions. But if you find yourself practicing user-centered design for FoC, you're going to be thinking about those needs just by the nature of your project, and there's no reason you couldn't take those same biases with you to any other project, or convince other designers that they're important.\n\nAlso, black boxes are not the problem to be solved, and complicated \u2192 simple \u2192 too simple is not just a matter of complexity changing hands. If you made some translation software and were concerned about a person's need to wean themself off of it and have fun by actually learning the language, it doesn't matter that the translation happens in a black box. No fraction of exposed translation technology is going to empower them to learn the language. To do a good job, you're going to invent wholly new complexity in the form of a language learning system for which some of the complexity is in the user's hands and some is in the designer's. Nothing about black boxes prevents you from satisfying that need. Similarly, car engines are too complicated for everyone to understand, but designers address your need for resilience to engine failure not by exposing parts of the engine, but by adding a totally separate backup system that's easily understood: the hooks that allow you to attach your car to another.\n\nSo I wouldn't jump immediately to making white box systems. If you're consciously reacting to a person's needs, chances are that you'll think of more ways to do that than exposing the system's guts.\n\nI did really like the article. I just don't think there's anything I could add to the parts I agree with. :slightly_smiling_face:",

There's no zero sum game being played by translation software and language learning software. People fail just as hard as technological systems when their jobs become too complex. And burdening someone with the knowledge of video conferencing network protocols doesn't make them less angry about dropped calls.\n\nIt's certainly a failure of the way user-centered design is practiced that designers so often neglect a person's need to be empowered to learn, a person's need to be resilient in the case of failure, and a person's need to understand the consequences of their actions. But if you find yourself practicing user-centered design for FoC, you're going to be thinking about those needs just by the nature of your project, and there's no reason you couldn't take those same biases with you to any other project, or convince other designers that they're important.\n\nAlso, black boxes are not the problem to be solved, and complicated \u2192 simple \u2192 too simple is not just a matter of complexity changing hands. If you made some translation software and were concerned about a person's need to wean themself off of it and have fun by actually learning the language, it doesn't matter that the translation happens in a black box. No fraction of exposed translation technology is going to empower them to learn the language. To do a good job, you're going to invent wholly new complexity in the form of a language learning system for which some of the complexity is in the user's hands and some is in the designer's. Nothing about black boxes prevents you from satisfying that need. Similarly, car engines are too complicated for everyone to understand, but designers address your need for resilience to engine failure not by exposing parts of the engine, but by adding a totally separate backup system that's easily understood: the hooks that allow you to attach your car to another.\n\nSo I wouldn't jump immediately to making white box systems. If you're consciously reacting to a person's needs, chances are that you'll think of more ways to do that than exposing the system's guts.\n\nI did really like the article. I just don't think there's anything I could add to the parts I agree with. "

        "text": "I had an interesting argument the other day with 2 engineers in this group, who happen to work in automotive real time systems. I suggested that having a pair of central computers that run all the systems would be safer than having 27 different computer systems in a car (Tesla has around that number of computer chips i understand). they were vehement, to the point of anger for suggesting that type of architecture. They insisted that having the braking system on its own machine was safer, because that way a failure in the combustion computer won't affect the braking. However, they were wrong, as the probability of failure increases as you add independent systems. If you have a 1 out of 1000 chance of a catastrophic failure in a single lightbulb, and you have 100 lightbulbs, the probability of a failure in at least 1 of them is almost 10%...so you are better off having only 3 computers, and running all the systems off of the vote of the majority. that is how they do it in spacecraft when they want things to work for 30 years without repair.  My guess is that they are worried about performance sagging at critical times with all these different processes. But still, the automotive business is cheap, and they typically have no redundancy on their critical sensors and systems. really not a great way to operate, and when the chips go out of production these cars will be unrepairable. Junkyards will be very busy serving the electrical car era.",

I suggested that having a pair of central computers that run all the systems would be safer than having 27 different computer systems in a car (Tesla has around that number of computer chips i understand). they were vehement, to the point of anger for suggesting that type of architecture. They insisted that having the braking system on its own machine was safer, because that way a failure in the combustion computer won't affect the braking. However, they were wrong, as the probability of failure increases as you add independent systems. If you have a 1 out of 1000 chance of a catastrophic failure in a single lightbulb, and you have 100 lightbulbs, the probability of a failure in at least 1 of them is almost 10%...so you are better off having only 3 computers, and running all the systems off of the vote of the majority. that is how they do it in spacecraft when they want things to work for 30 years without repair.  My guess is that they are worried about performance sagging at critical times with all these different processes. But still, the automotive business is cheap, and they typically have no redundancy on their critical sensors and systems. really not a great way to operate, and when the chips go out of production these cars will be unrepairable. Junkyards will be very busy serving the electrical car era."

In vehicles, similarly to Erlang, you want to be able to maximally continue operation in the event of catastrophic, and typically _physical,_ failure of any nodes or the network itself \u2014 things like cables being cut or a liquid being spilled on one of your chips or contacts corroding or electronics overheating or desoldering \u2014 because that might happen while you're speeding down the highway or driving up the side of a mountain. You want independent and redundant pieces that can, if needed and as much as possible, operate with a modicum of functionality in the absence of part or all of the network.

For instance, in the event of a failure that causes a network partition with the host controller on one side, the nodes on the other side are either useless or need to fall back to totally independent operation.

My main website is at <https://mmm.s-ol.nu|https://mmm.s-ol.nu>, and a bit more stable. <http://ba.s-ol.nu|ba.s-ol.nu> is going to stay up at least until my thesis evaluation is over, just to be sure, but then it will probably go away, with the changes merged into master and the permalink updated accordingly.",

Sometimes they are used rather as different attributes (such as a human-friendly title for a folder), sometimes they are used as alternative variants of the same content (gallery and slideshow view of a list of pictures). For the thesis, there are two variants; one which only links to the project log and one which embeds all pages (for printing)."

Scratch certainly isn\u2019t everything \u2014 its design decisions involve tradeoffs, and I\u2019m curious about where others see those tradeoffs being the wrong decisions (I know a few that Steven Krouse would change!). But it\u2019s amazing to here about how many people started having delightful, exciting experiences programming with Scratch.\n\nFor me, the gateway drug was BASIC on the Apple II \u2014 part of the fun was that my teachers didn\u2019t understand it, or even know it was possible to get a BASIC interpreter prompt just by hitting control-reset. But it had in common with Scratch that you could make something surprising in a minute or two.\n\n<@UQPHR6Y3S> and <@UA14TGLTC>, what do you work on?",

Scratch certainly isn\u2019t everything \u2014 its design decisions involve tradeoffs, and I\u2019m curious about where others see those tradeoffs being the wrong decisions (I know a few that Steven Krouse would change!). But it\u2019s amazing to here about how many people started having delightful, exciting experiences programming with Scratch.\n\nFor me, the gateway drug was BASIC on the Apple II \u2014 part of the fun was that my teachers didn\u2019t understand it, or even know it was possible to get a BASIC interpreter prompt just by hitting control-reset. But it had in common with Scratch that you could make something surprising in a minute or two.\n\n"

There is a specialized technique available to iOS developers for installing apps on their own devices, for testing purposes only, but this technique is deliberately locked down by Apple, by the use of digital certificate trickery, so that you can't use it to distribute apps. In practice, a user cannot install apps on an iOS device without going through the official Apple app store.\nThis distinction between Android and iOS matters, because Apple heavily restricts the kinds of FoC content that they will permit in the iOS app store. For example:\n\u2022 Apps may not download or install standalone apps, kexts, additional code, or resources to add functionality or significantly change the app from what we see during the review process.\n\u2022 Educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes.\n\u2022 Apps that create alternate desktop/home screen environments or simulate multi-app widget experiences will be rejected.\nThere's more, and Apple will reject apps for additional reasons that aren't written down.\n\nIn general, Apple will not tolerate any iOS software that conforms to Alan Kay's vision of \"personal dynamic media\", in which personal computers are fully programmable by the end user.",

Seems like you have a strong opinion on where the future of programming is going to happen\u2026 or not.\n\nI support you. I\u2019d love to see your plan come to fruition and challenge the status quo. More competition would be great.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d also like to encourage you to not close your eyes and ignore what\u2019s happening on the platforms you don\u2019t support for whatever reason. Good ideas can pop up everywhere. There\u2019s a lot of great talent working on Apple platforms, in particular people who are not just exceptional developers, but also have very strong design skills.\n\nWe all have our preferences.

This is, in fact, a big reason I'm so fond of visual programming \u2014\u00a0taking programming off the character grid, adding animation and spatial relationships and things coming in and out of view. These things allow for tutorialization and self-explanation in really rich ways. I love the hackable tutorials in HyperCard and Max/MSP / Pure Data \u2014\u00a0it's so fun to be able to pull up a reference, and that reference includes a live-running example, and you can hack on that example. With the right framing device, you can make a lot of things self-discoverable that historically required external instruction."

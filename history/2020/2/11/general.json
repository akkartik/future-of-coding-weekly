In this first installment I'll be focusing mainly on how the back-end works: specifically, how we're able to not only rewind the state of your code, but any changes to the filesystem and spawned subprocesses as well. From a high level, this allows for a lot of cool functionality like real undo in a REPL. However, we'll also see how time traveling is actually essential to the way notebooks fundamentally work in RunKit.",

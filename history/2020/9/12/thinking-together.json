You can't easily replace 4 hours of watching tv with 4 hours of high-intense practice. But replacing 4 hours of tv with 30 minutes or an hour of practice should be fine.\n\nBut on the other hand, I don't believe you need a thousand hours to be competent either. My guess is 100\u2013500 hours depending on the skill.\n\nThat should give you 1\u20133 skills per year. So yeah, tv is huge waste either way."

I\u2019ve been looking at linguistics, category theory, bidirectional transformations, parsers/grammars, complexity theory, and Christopher Alexander\u2019s work on Wholeness/Life and his generative process of unfolding which I just recently started to understand as having parallels to Chomsky and grammars (search for Greg Bryant, if that sounds interesting). \n\nAll these things are very different disciplines but somehow I started to see strong parallels and connections which I totally believe can be expressed mathematically. And very likely we have already identified all the structures we need, we just need to make the connections explicit. Unfortunately, I often find it hard to describe and it makes total sense in my head, but then I\u2019m struggling explaining it to others.\n\nIt looks like you\u2019re onto something that ties into this and might help me find ways to explain some of these connections better.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even touching on all the exciting ways this might help us find better visual representations for programming systems!",

Much respect to him for his work. I need to look up Greg Bryant, thanks for the pointer!\n\nI am working on and off on my mathematical skills to see how I can represent these ideas well. This is why I started the research on notation to see how historically they have helped us in expressing that other realm that we have inside us: <https://github.com/prathyvsh/notation> I am pursuing it under a feel that there is a good ROI from having a good fitness between the content/context relationship for the constructs you device to ground these forms.\n\nWill definitely share when I have some clarity on this.

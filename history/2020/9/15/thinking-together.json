Will read that blog post.\n\n*3 Recursion + Chomsky* \u2014 If I understand you correctly, I think you're interpreting what I said already on a more abstract level than I meant it, which is interesting. That's the main problem discussing these things: we talk about abstraction all the time and we do it all the time, but we don't really have a sense for which level of abstraction we're at right now. We can only determine where we are in the hierarchy of abstractions in a relative way, by pointing out what's above or below. There is no stable absolute coordinate system that's granular enough. Feels a lot like category theory.\n\nThe way I just recently started to understand Alexander's pattern language, seems even more down-to-earth, pragmatic application of a grammar with certain terminals and non-terminals, which form a hierarchy. The point is that such a language can be described with a finite amount of elements (or patterns, in Alexander's case), but can be combined to construct an infinite amount of resulting artifacts (built structures, in Alexander's case). Through the language we get hierarchy, so there are patterns that apply to different levels of scale (up from patterns for towns, through patterns for houses, to patterns for ornaments). These correspond to where in the syntax tree they are; higher-level (town) non-terminals often rely on several more layers of lower-level (house) non-terminals until you finally resolve to a terminal (~ ornaments?).\nSo that's all pretty basic generative grammars stuff.\n\nAlexander doesn't like recursion, because there isn't really an infinite sequence anywhere in nature. It all begins and ends somewhere. So it doesn't map perfectly. But I'm willing to consider that an \"implementation detail\". :slightly_smiling_face:\nBut I expect more clarity on this from his Nature of Order series, which I will finally attempt to read soon.",

        "text": "<@UHWC9PXBL> I have been meaning to look at Nada\u2019s work for a while, but I lacked the math-fu to tackle it and sat through the first 20 minutes wondering like what was even happening when I saw it a couple of years ago. But I think I\u2019m reasonably ready now to slowly work towards absorbing the lessons there. That + MiniKanren by Friedman/Byrd been on my list for a while.\n\nThank you for the links on Kernel, coming across of it for the first time. Will take a closer look at this one. Yeah, folds and unfolds (Origami programming I think it\u2019s called? <https://archive.alvb.in/msc/11_infomtpt/papers/origami-programming_Gibbons.pdf>) points at that deep correspondence between Initial/Final (co)algebras that I have been talking about. I think the idea here is that you can modularize everything down to a sequence of unary/binary function and then talk about folding them to get data and unfolding the data to get the sequence back. This I think is a powerful idea and continuations I think are like things that does these sporadically and jumps to another part (like goto) to create a computational structure. Bird/Meerteens/Gibbons seem to be the people who pioneer work in this domain. Their Algorithmics movement I think is a great advancement in this direction. I found this person on Twitter who have been reading papers on these and doing a review of them: <https://twitter.com/chansey97>\n\nRe: Specter/Lenses is another place, though I don\u2019t know how they related to these structures. But is something I would love to read further. I see Profunctor Optics have slowly turned into a central focus point among theorists.\n\nOne of the central things I think in computing and most of mathematics is the idea of duality. So that defunctionalization/refunctionalization as much as I understand is a way to reify a continuation so that it can be treated as a datastructure. If my guess is not far off, what you get is the above mentioned algebra structure which the folds and unfolds work over. The beauty about algebra is that you get a lot of nice properties which yields itself to different ways of instrumenting into the program. Like associativity guarantees that the brackets around operations a(bc)(de) can be moved around giving (ab)(cd)e meaning you can execute each of those functions in any context (any thread when mapped to a computational substrate) and then rejoin the result to get back the original one. Mathematicians go further and generalize that to ideas like Tamari lattice: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice> where all such orderings are studied and their properties are investigated. So this bigger perspective of looking at things gives an idea to locate where the dualities arise and then instrument your program accordingly. Writing all that makes me wish there was an interactive space to show how all these things fit together.\n\nThanks a tonne for your input and I\u2019ll definitely look through them and respond back when I have better clarity on these.",

That + MiniKanren by Friedman/Byrd been on my list for a while.\n\nThank you for the links on Kernel, coming across of it for the first time. Will take a closer look at this one.

I think the idea here is that you can modularize everything down to a sequence of unary/binary function and then talk about folding them to get data and unfolding the data to get the sequence back. This I think is a powerful idea and continuations I think are like things that does these sporadically and jumps to another part (like goto) to create a computational structure. Bird/Meerteens/Gibbons seem to be the people who pioneer work in this domain. Their Algorithmics movement I think is a great advancement in this direction. I found this person on Twitter who have been reading papers on these and doing a review of them: "

I see Profunctor Optics have slowly turned into a central focus point among theorists.\n\nOne of the central things I think in computing and most of mathematics is the idea of duality. So that defunctionalization/refunctionalization as much as I understand is a way to reify a continuation so that it can be treated as a datastructure. If my guess is not far off, what you get is the above mentioned algebra structure which the folds and unfolds work over. The beauty about algebra is that you get a lot of nice properties which yields itself to different ways of instrumenting into the program. Like associativity guarantees that the brackets around operations a(bc)(de) can be moved around giving (ab)(cd)e meaning you can execute each of those functions in any context (any thread when mapped to a computational substrate) and then rejoin the result to get back the original one. Mathematicians go further and generalize that to ideas like Tamari lattice: "

Il offre la possibilit&eacute; de travailler de fa&ccedil;on individuelle ou collaborative, de lire un script de fa&ccedil;on lin&eacute;aire ou s&eacute;quentielle rapide, de d&eacute;couper, conserver, comparer ou &eacute;changer des morceaux d&rsquo;algorithme. Ce dispositif a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u pour des personnes aveugles ou mal-voyantes et leur est donc parfaitement accessible. Cela permet un travail commun entre personnes dites valides et personnes en situations de handicap.\n\nIntervention Mall&amp;t&rsquo; Algo en Main le 12 avril dernier  Merci @SemCodesSources\n\n\nInterventions / Pr&eacute;sentations / Formations :\n\n\n\n\nInterventions/Pr&eacute;sentations/Formations sur Mall&amp;t&rsquo; Algo en Main\nLes publications / Articles :\nPublications / Articles sur Mall&amp;t&rsquo; Algo en Main\n\nBonne lecture&nbsp;:&nbsp;Articles plus bas&hellip;\n&nbsp;1.

Using programming to support software development with things like continuous integration, and automated testing (these are both actually popular, but in my experience programmers tend not to like working on them very much).\n2. Solving problems programming problems programmatically, e.g., writing shell scripts or using  text editor marcos (<https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros>) to perform a refactor that isn't supported by refactoring tools.\n3.

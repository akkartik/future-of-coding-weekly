I always found all the architecture astronomy Java programmers got into to be extremely frustrating -- until I started using an IDE and realized that they were using operations that their tooling made much easier than it was for me in Vim.\n\nThis is why C++ programmers write longer functions than Java programmers: the C++ grammar is context-sensitive and harder to build an IDE for. Which connects up neatly with another thread this morning, with <@U01286RNB70>: <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1599495354127000?thread_ts=1599070210.092100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL|https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1599495354127000?thread_ts=1599070210.092100&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL>\n\n&gt; There is read-eval-print-loop. I am doing that just sending the print back to my editor. It also exposes an interface which is what people think of as a repl.\n&gt; \nThis should seem like pedantic philosophical hairsplitting, but I'm finding it interesting for some reason. The way I see it:\n\n* Your environment allows showing values of variables anywhere.\n* For historical reasons, it does this by using a REPL behind the scenes.\n* Since there's a REPL, it exposes it to you that you _could_ use.\n\nBut as you said, you don't normally use the REPL. That says to me you have something _better_. There's a spatial component here that sounds awesome. While it's technically correct to call it a read-eval-print-loop, I think that understates the value.",

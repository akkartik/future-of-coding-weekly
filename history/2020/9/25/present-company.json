There's a bit of an irony because I should also automate cross posting, but zapier doesn't support substack cross posting :/. Another reason to look for another more code friendly blogging platform. The other big thing I've noticed is that my posts about a specific software tool do much better than ideas about general techniques. So if something says \"vi\" or \"bash\" in the title, it does well. I love tools, so I have no problem writing more tutorials on productive ways to use tools like vi and sed.

My comment was meant conceptually, not talking about implementation. There are many different ways to implement it, and it doesn't have to end up in an actual tree data structure, but conceptually it seems to me that there is a line that's crossed when you need to deal with overlapping ranges where you cross over into a different complexity class.\n\nIf I'd be better at math, I'd probably be able to explain that better with algebraic structures and the operations defined on them. I think it has to do with the total order requirement on the character sequence, which makes ranges work, but then as soon as you start handling ranges as their own entities with their own operations defined on them, you are introducing another\u2026 hmm\u2026 _layer_ that has different requirements. And that's what I mean by hierarchy \u2014 layers are _above_ the sequence conceptually and allow certain operations, doesn't matter how you implement them.\n\nAh, well, that probably doesn't help, sorry. I wish I could explain it better. Right now it just _feels_ to me that there are some use cases, like cut &amp; paste of arbitrary ranges which don't correspond exactly to layer range boundaries, that can't be represented unambiguously with a pure linear sequence + a set of ranges into that sequence. It could probably be worked around though with some heuristics that'll translate the edge cases into weird/unintuitive behavior from the user's perspective, and perhaps that's totally acceptable.\n\nBut I'd love to be proven wrong and maybe there's a better way!

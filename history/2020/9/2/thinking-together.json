We have a much easier term visually parsing, internalizing and imagining even very complex trees than heavily linked cyclic graphs. There's an entire sub-discipline of data visualization trying to help people understand the latter kind of data. This is one of the deep challenges of node-and-arrow visual programming systems.\n2. Although our internal representations are fuzzy and graph-y, the mechanisms we have to communicate those representations in speech and writing are linear and tree shaped (sequences of words representing recursive grammatical structures). This makes it very hard to express these kinds of structures using syntax, thus programming languages tied to textual representations are at a huge disadvantage when encoding graphs as literals. This is one of the deepest powers of node-and-arrow programming systems.\n/cc <@UC2A2ARPT>",

        "text": "I think <@UAJKEBGP8> brings up a great point: there's a distinction to be made here between _negative_ feedback, and _critical_ feedback. Purely negative feedback (\"this is crap\", \"why would you waste your time on that?\") usually comes from people who wish you ill, but the best critical feedback comes from those who want you to succeed, and who are well-intended in their criticisms (that's not to say that this sort of feedback can't be incisive -- it often is, but i'll deal with that later). In my view, the only feedback that you should consider acting on is that which comes from the sorts of people who mean well. But just like hearing your mother shouting \"clean your room!\", it is often difficult and uncomfortable to deal with such advice, and it often comes across as curt or abrasive. The best way I've found is to look at feedback, not as a criticism of my \"self\", but rather as being critical of some work I've produced or some action I've taken. That may sound clich\u00e9, but if someone's well-intentioned criticism of your work bothers you deeply, you need to examine your personal reasons for why that is the case.

(checks notes)... every other aspect of your life. It's the sort of thing that primary education ought to teach, but doesn't.\n\nIn terms of \"the expectation is that criticism would bother you\", it is normative to feel prickled by criticism, but the more productive framing is gratitude for an opportunity to improve this thing about which you care so much. There's nothing easy about moving from defensive to open hearted, but it's one of the most worthwhile things you can do."

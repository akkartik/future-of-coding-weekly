Most \"naievly\", one might have said, in 1960: \"computers have incredible raw computing power. They will surely outperform mathematicians and physicists with mathematical breakthroughs\". But the Poincare conjecture, Fermat's last theorem, and the superstring revolutions were (?) all old-school no-computer maths. People are now talking about AI revolutionizing maths and physics, and maybe that'll happen, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\nWith that in the background, consider the following question: \"Why do people not use GA?\" The answer is not mathematical; the mathematical breakthroughs that should have convinced people to adopt it have already happened. The gap is \"soft\", i.e. it's in the domain of psychology (or even philosophy if you like Charles Gunn). That creates a \"cultural\" challenge, and you are precisely right that getting cultural change is hard (certainly harder than \"hey, here's algorithm X, it is 30% faster than algorithm Y). I think most people who understand the issue agree that this is the case. It's a hard problem, and it's an important one too, because GA really is a lot better than vector algebra.\n\nAlright, we've got two questions: \"can computers actually change physics?\" and \"what needs to be done to bring about the revolution in physics that is GA's destiny?\". And I'm betting my farm on the idea that the first is the answer to the second. That with computer visualization and a well-thought-out \"coding\" \"environment\" (mathland!), you can get exactly the cognitive revolution/cultural change you want in physics. To me, everything said by our great \"philosophers of computer visualization and psychology\", i.e. Alan Kay, Seymour Papert, Bret Victor and Jonathan Blow, can be applied quite well to propagating GA.\n\nBut to be clear, I was interested in Blow/Victor/Papert before I was interested in GA. I might almost (almost) say that I am not, as such, interested in GA :smile: the main thing I am interested in is proving that computers visualization can revolutionize physics. So, yes, it's a challenge, and that's the point. If it works, nobody will be able to deny the power of the Papertian program.",

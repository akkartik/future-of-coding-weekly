So IPNS defines its own global name space, but the names are just as ugly as IPFS multihashes. There is also a mechanism to map standard domain names to IPNS public keys (I don't remember how it works exactly), but that's considered a temporary workaround, since relying on DNS is not compatible with the goals of the DWeb. My impression is that ENS (Ethereum Name Service) has become  a more popular alternative for named entry points to IPFS data.\n\nThe author of InfoCentral criticizes IPFS for its IPNS layer, which doesn't fit his idea of a complete absence of mutable references. What he doesn't seem to realized is that IPNS is an optional layer; he could build his system on the fully immutable basic layer and simply ignore IPNS.",

                                "text": " IPNS defines mutable references via a public/private key pair. The \"name\" of such a reference is the public key, and only the holder of the private key can change the value of the reference. So IPNS defines its own global name space, but the names are just as ugly as IPFS multihashes. There is also a mechanism to map standard domain names to IPNS public keys (I don't remember how it works exactly), but that's considered a temporary workaround, since relying on DNS is not compatible with the goals of the DWeb. My impression is that ENS (Ethereum Name Service) has become  a more popular alternative for named entry points to IPFS data.\n\nThe author of InfoCentral criticizes IPFS for its IPNS layer, which doesn't fit his idea of a complete absence of mutable references. What he doesn't seem to realized is that IPNS is an optional layer; he could build his system on the fully immutable basic layer and simply ignore IPNS."

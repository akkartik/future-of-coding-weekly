Home chefs / \u2019amateur\u2019s use scaled down pots &amp; pans. Industrial kitchens are more like factories and use giant equipment that an \u2018end-user\u2019 would never really consider buying. But both of these are 100% valid industries and crafts. There\u2019s more content targeting end-user home-chefs than there is for elite chefs. In theory, restaurants could provide 99% of the meals that all humans need but cost, cultural traditions, etc are still big barriers.\n\nThis has preserved home-cooking for literally centuries! If restaurants / central kitchens could provide all meals at the same cost as you making it, I predict we\u2019d see a huge dip in home-cooking. Most people don\u2019t make their own furniture anymore but pretty much everyone still cooks to some degree (even if you\u2019re just microwaving food). Necessity is really the driver / mother of invention here. Home-cooking is still the best hammer for most people\u2019s food problems",

I started researching into the history of Lambda Calculus (which sort of is the foundation for a lot of FP stuff) and as my understanding sharpened I found out that there is a lot of concurrency, link backs, reinterpretation etc. that happens in that space. But to narrate this (hi)story as one goddamn thing after another, it becomes important to partition the graph to a linear list (or tree/lattice). That is what I am trying to capture with this series.\n\nThese are all great materials: <https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1606080246079200?thread_ts=1606079753.078900&amp;channel=C5T9GPWFL&amp;message_ts=1606080246.079200>\n\nIf you love Hofstadter\u2019s work I highly recommend you look into Louis Kauffman\u2019s video.

Manifolds are the quintessential things I am talking about and the reason for starting this as I found out that there is this aspect of linearizing them which happens in computation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_group?wprov=sfti1>\n\n2. I need to look up Landow\u2019s work. First time hearing about him.\n\n3. Its not graphs exactly that is the emphasis here, but a (un)connected manifold that has got braids. I hope it will become clear as I write up the next entries in the series. The idea is that there is a linearization that takes these high dimensional manifolds to linearized ones as we take a graph to create narratives using some property of it for partially / linearly ordering its entities.",

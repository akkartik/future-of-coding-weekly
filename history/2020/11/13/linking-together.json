At one point I thought I shouldn't do this because I want to do his work justice.\n\nThe only book I have read from Christopher Alexander is Notes on the Synthesis of Form. And that is one book I keep revisiting even after years of reading it because it was such a dense book even when it is low on page count. That is one of those life changing books of mine that hinted me to the idea that synergies from different domains could be brought into practices like design/engineering.\n\nRe: geometry, I think Christopher Alexander's style is much more in line with that of Frank Lloyd Wright. Both of them have this sort of geometric sense which aligns greatly with nature. So to point out what I mean by the bouba style, I think Ernst Haeckel's work would be exemplary. There's this sort of morphogenetic unfolding nature to whole of Alexander's ouevre which I find culminates in him identifying those 15 patterns.\n\nIf I understand it correctly, those 15 patterns are a distillation of what he find \"animating\"/life giving in nature. This is one of the reasons I think it would be injustice if I straight away jump into animating them without imbibing his (dense) context. What do you think?",

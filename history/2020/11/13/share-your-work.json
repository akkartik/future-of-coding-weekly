You could possibly imagine a simplified version which shows the live coder which parts of their performance are taking the most time.  That's probably just looking for a hammer now I've got the nails though ;)\nAlso, I think I will add frame candles so you can see spikes in performance and indications of memory allocations.  I'll put these things in as I need them.\nI looked for an ImGui profiler before doing this one; I found  one that didn't handle threads very well, or profile events that spanned frames.  I found another that was a butchered version of the first one, with better UI but worse profiling.  In the end, this only took a few hours over the course of a week to do; I'm pleased I put in the effort.  My version will be OS in a week or so when I've finished tweaking it and pushed it to my shared library.\nI'm not claiming this is fast, but for my purposes it is 'fast enough' :slightly_smiling_face: It allocates all the memory up front, and records simple time stamps, so overhead is fairly decent, which is all I need.",

You could possibly imagine a simplified version which shows the live coder which parts of their performance are taking the most time.  That's probably just looking for a hammer now I've got the nails though ;)\nAlso, I think I will add frame candles so you can see spikes in performance and indications of memory allocations.  I'll put these things in as I need them.\nI looked for an ImGui profiler before doing this one; I found  one that didn't handle threads very well, or profile events that spanned frames.  I found another that was a butchered version of the first one, with better UI but worse profiling.  In the end, this only took a few hours over the course of a week to do; I'm pleased I put in the effort.  My version will be OS in a week or so when I've finished tweaking it and pushed it to my shared library.\nI'm not claiming this is fast, but for my purposes it is 'fast enough' "

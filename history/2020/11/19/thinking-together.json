Better introspection of the language using a language server would help matters....  Implementation of this stuff gets quite tricky if you want it to be fast and handle combinations of states, such as highlighting text while working with the syntax coloring.  Really, you need a layer system to prioritize the coloring of each character based on the background, syntax color, additional effects, etc.\n\nTokens:\n<https://github.com/Rezonality/zep/blob/master/src/syntax_providers.cpp>\n\nImplementation:\n<https://github.com/Rezonality/zep/blob/master/src/syntax.cpp>\n\nRainbow Brackets:\n<https://github.com/Rezonality/zep/blob/master/src/syntax_rainbow_brackets.cpp>",

Better introspection of the language using a language server would help matters....  Implementation of this stuff gets quite tricky if you want it to be fast and handle combinations of states, such as highlighting text while working with the syntax coloring.  Really, you need a layer system to prioritize the coloring of each character based on the background, syntax color, additional effects, etc.\n\nTokens:\n"

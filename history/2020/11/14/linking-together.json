What I'd really like to do though, is to have a broader discussion with you specifically about the connections I see between Alexander's theory as described in _Nature of Order_ and the mathematical work you do. I think that would be much easier in a synchronous fashion. Would you be interested in having a video chat about that in the near future?",

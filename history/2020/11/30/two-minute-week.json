I knew I had to do the same and hadn't achieved that yet, so I reworked uCISC syntax from the ground up to be what it should be given the hardware and wrote a compiler for it. From there, I went full emulator, trying and succeeding to get really close parity with the virtual version with the hardware. Faster iterations, better debugging without losing predictable hardware execution. To put the new language through it's paces, I started writing a game you can play over UART. It's about 800 lines of code written from the ground up, text routines, I/O, everything and translates to about that many instructions. Approaching 2k words after you add in text literals.

If research shows these things are good, then we should use them, if not, then not. In fact, this sort of response can be used to rebut almost anything we want to explore in the future of coding community. Why are we so interested in \"X\" if \"X\" hasn't been shown to be better via research? This sort of response has always bothered me. So I wrote a blog post on that question.\n\n<https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/empirical>",

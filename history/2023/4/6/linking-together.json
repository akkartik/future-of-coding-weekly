It's main claim is that software, so far,  has not had the expected impact on overall productivity, and that the challenge is that it is _hard_ and _expensive_ to model the real world within the constraints of programming. (Maybe you read it differently!) It seems to me that this is one big challenge with end-user programming, too: many people don't want to think beforehand about all the exceptions to a rule that happen in real life, since real life allows you to address those exceptions on-the-fly.\n\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20221206161753/https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/softwareisprocess.html>",

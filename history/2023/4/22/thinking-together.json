I care a lot about making programs Malleable or comprehensible to as many people as possible (<http://akkartik.name/about>) But I find permacomputing is able to coexist with these ideas better than say Collapse Computing (<https://collapseos.org>). The latter may be right or wrong, the future will decide. But Permacomputing feels definitely right, a good set of principles to strive for, as you said <@UJBAJNFLK>. It's just incomplete, and worth complementing with principles from elsewhere. And that's ok. It's a good compass. I have to go against it for short periods, but if I start going in the opposite direction for a long time I find it useful to question if I'm lost.",

However, using d3-force for graph layout means that nodes can (somewhat) organically transition from layout A to layout B. The main layout problem I haven't solved yet is that between refreshes the graph can sometimes be laid out differently. It's usually fairly similar, especially if the graph stays the same as randomness is seeded by graph structure, but sometimes after editing a bunch and refreshing subtrees swap places. In those cases it takes a sec to orient to the different parts of the graph, but search is there to help. I'd argue the time/brain power spent regroking the layout is less than the time and brain power spent creating a meaningful layout manually (I and many other TD/Houdini/unity devs I know spent countless hours rearranging graphs where \"power assist\" autolayout hurt more than it helped), and for sure more human-centric than a large text file.",

Added that as a feature to the block language and the reasoner on Monday. Added it to the API for the reasoner yesterday. Today I need to implement it in the \"Scenario Editor\" which allows users to describe facts, run queries against those facts, and display the results. Absolutely dreading it. Wish me luck.",

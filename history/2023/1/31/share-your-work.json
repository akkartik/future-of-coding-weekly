As far as whether the layer is optional, it very much isn't as knowledge of types informs code generation :shrug: .\n<@U0296ACR13M> Thanks! So, in this system, we no longer have a notion of \"precedence\" in function overload resolution. If there is any ambiguity (multiple functions w/ the same signature), the answer is to always ask the user. `You could still end visibly exactly the same function calls binding to different overloads.` So that's already the case with `a + b` and `c + d`, if a &amp; b are ints, but c &amp; d are strings, right? Now I actually solve this by coloring all identifiers according to the hash of the definition, so the two function calls would very likely have different colors, allowing you to immediately recognize them as distinct.\n<@U013ZLJARC7> thanks for the link! fascinating read.",

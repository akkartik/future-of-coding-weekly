His goal is to construct an entirely new computational stack that is:\n\u2022 robust-first\n\u2022 indefinitely-scalable\n\u2022 non-deterministic\n\u2022 programmed with spatial-programming\nThe whole thing is a massive inspiration to me and I would have never got into the world of computing without it! Maybe it'll inspire you too.\nAnd this week, he finally produced a self-replicating 'cell'. I found it oddly emotional to see the project get to this milestone!

                "text": "Recent announcement of Project Mage inspired me to write a short tour around the current scene of #StructuralEditors - from my perspective, so I shall begin with the projects that resonate with me most strongly.\n\nSo, the number 1 is @leif@toot.leif.pl 's work on \"Interactive Visual Syntax\", as explained here:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8htgAxJuK5c>\n\n(Leif also implemented this idea in the visr.pl online IDE)\n\nNumber 2 is @vez@mathstodon.xyz 's Polytope editor for JavaScript:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_XCZSY7lM>\n\nI was also hugely impressed with @disconcision@types.pl 's Fructure, which - except just being a beautiful user experience also is a beautiful implementation:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbVCNIh1NA>\n\nAndy has since moved to other places, contributing to Cyrus Omar's <http://hazel.org|hazel.org> and David Moon's <http://tylr.fun|tylr.fun>\n\nNot long after releasing my first prototype of GRASP, I ran into Yasuyuki Maeda (who's Japanese, but happened to be touring around Europe at that time), who did this really amazing front-end for Clojure:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuU0HI-paik>\n\nWithin the same space, there's Ella Hoeppner's Vlojure for ClojureScript:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OcAUhe3E1E>\n\nKatie Bell did a sort of similar work for Python that can be found at <http://splootcode.io|splootcode.io>\n\n@o_kryvonos@indieweb.social living in Ukraine under russian fire managed to deliver Lisperanto:\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNyuMK8ZrHI>\n\nAmong Ukrainian hackers, there's also Ivan Daniluk, who has some very interesting thoughts concerning \"visual programming\": <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps3mBPcjySE>\n\nAnd of course there's @jonathoda@mastodon.social who - in addition to doing crazy experiments with his SubText (e.g. <https://vimeo.com/451278506>) has been doing wonderful stuff in bringing the community together with various workshops and other social initiatives.\n\nAlso, a lot of cool ideas can be found on \"Emil's Programming Viz\" vlog:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/@emilsprogrammingviz1811>\n\nWhen it comes to visual thinking about computation, the ideas of @spiralganglion@mastodon.social on the Hest programming environment are really outstanding, as is his conduction of the \"Future of Coding\" podcast (and taking @jimmyhmiller@hachyderm.io on board was certainly a great idea).\n\nYair Chuchem (and others) also did impressive work with the Lambdu programming environment, and Yair himself created this wonderful list of \"awesome structure editors\":\n<https://github.com/yairchu/awesome-structure-editors>\n\nIf you feel that this list is incomplete or that your project (or some other important project) is missing from here, it's perhaps also because 2500 characters on this mastodon instance aren't all that much, but of course feel free to add replies to this toot.",

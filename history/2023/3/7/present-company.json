I knew within a few years that most of the people in my field were working on problems I didn't care about, so I spent my summers doing internships and landed in industry.\n\nSo my #1 recommendation is to figure out before you apply who is doing work that you find exciting.\n\nAnd since you're asking here, I'll assume your interests  are somehow related to building the \"Future of Coding\". It would be worth looking into why some of the top people in the FoC community have chosen to do independent research instead of following the typical academic route (e.g., Andy Matuschak), and how other people who are in academia have made it work (e.g., Philip Guo's Python Tutor).",

I knew within a few years that most of the people in my field were working on problems I didn't care about, so I spent my summers doing internships and landed in industry.\n\nSo my #1 recommendation is to figure out before you apply who is doing work that you find exciting.\n\nAnd since you're asking here, I'll assume your interests  are somehow related to building the \"Future of Coding\". It would be worth looking into why some of the top people in the FoC community have chosen to do independent research instead of following the typical academic route (e.g., Andy Matuschak), and how other people who are in academia have made it work (e.g., Philip Guo's Python Tutor)."

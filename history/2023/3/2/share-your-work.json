You can try it at <https://desk-x.com/|https://desk-x.com/> (You should wait for up to 10 seconds on the first load to fetch and compile a Wasm binary. If it seems crash before running, reloading without caches or using other devices would help). Open the editor by clicking the \"Fibonacci\" button, then hover or click anywhere within the code, and use arrow keys to move around the cursor word by word.\n\nIt's really lightweight to rendering the editor in 30fps or more with low cpu usage and it's throttled to 1fps while you aren't operating the input devices. If you have a cheap laptop or tablet, you should also try the editor on it, and it'll work nicely even on not powerful processors.\n\nYou may notice the quality of font rendering is not good. It varies on what browser you use, and zooming in the page should improves the readability. Although I don't mainly use apple devices, it's best and beautiful on their devices. I'm finding a way to fix this problem but not with the top priority.\n\nBased on this POC, I plan to add these features in this order:\n\n1. Rendering the code with syntax sugars\n2. Inlay-hints and hover popups to show the inferred type of an expression and any compiler messages\n3. :arrow_forward: button to run the code\n4. Dragging single or multiple expressions to move it to another place including other files\n5. Structural editing at cursor",

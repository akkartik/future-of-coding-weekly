I also like the augmented-ness of it, where you can see yourself and the glowing fluids overlayed, as if it\u2019s more of an embodied experience vs it being just your finger on touch devices (or more disconnected, as a mouse experience). That\u2019s where it feels more theatrical to me.\n\nTangible is def an area I\u2019m very interested in, and I want to explore some gestures that might use some natural feedback mechanics eg, if you tap your finger on your thumb you get tactile feedback for free. I rmb seeing <https://atap.google.com/soli/|Google Soli> doing it ages ago, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they followed through with it - dunno why. Part of my point with Magic Hands is to stimulate more ideas for getting away from standard keyboard, mouse and touch interactions, as Bret was trying to encourage in his article. Definitely a lot more work to be done there, but it\u2019s a good time to play with the tech :slightly_smiling_face:",

I also like the augmented-ness of it, where you can see yourself and the glowing fluids overlayed, as if it\u2019s more of an embodied experience vs it being just your finger on touch devices (or more disconnected, as a mouse experience). That\u2019s where it feels more theatrical to me.\n\nTangible is def an area I\u2019m very interested in, and I want to explore some gestures that might use some natural feedback mechanics eg, if you tap your finger on your thumb you get tactile feedback for free.

Part of my point with Magic Hands is to stimulate more ideas for getting away from standard keyboard, mouse and touch interactions, as Bret was trying to encourage in his article.

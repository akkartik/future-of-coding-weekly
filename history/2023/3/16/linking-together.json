                "text": "Efforts to push programming beyond static textual code have sought to imbue\nprogramming with multiple distinct qualities. One long-acknowledged quality is\nliveness: providing programmers with in-depth feedback about a program's\ndynamic behavior as the program is edited. A second quality, long-explored but\nlacking a shared term of art, is richness: allowing programmers to edit\nprograms though domain-specific representations and interactions rather than\nsolely through text. In this paper, we map the relationship between these two\nqualities and survey past work that exemplifies them. We observe that systems\ncombining liveness and richness often do so at the cost of an essential quality\nof traditional programming: composability. We argue that, by combining\nliveness, richness, and composability, programming systems can better capture\nthe full potential of interactive computation without leaving behind the\nexpressivity of traditional code.",

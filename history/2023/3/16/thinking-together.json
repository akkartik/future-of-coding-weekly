In this case though, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that thanks to AI we are headed towards a renaissance of the humanities. \n\nToday\u2019s LLMs and other AI technology will likely cost many jobs. A few years ago many professional language translators had to look for other ways to earn money, not because translation technology finally became great. It was (and still is) just good enough, but it\u2019s cheap, so that you can have stuff translated for (almost) free. If you don\u2019t need or want a proper high-quality translation, you can use AI for that. The result will likely be average at best, but there are a lot of tasks where mediocre and cheap is superior to excellent and expensive. \n\nI think the same will be happening to most written and graphical content, quickly followed by all kinds of media assets. For instance, game studios will for sure soon replace most designers with prompt engineers, perhaps first just for prototype assets, but it won\u2019t be long until that\u2019s good enough for a mediocre game to be published with such generated assets. On the plus side you could also see it that way: Soon you might be able to create your own game and don\u2019t need to pay for any artists and still get some decent assets for it.\n\nOf course, what happens to all those people out of their jobs? I don\u2019t know. Some will perhaps switch from programming or writing or graphic design to prompt engineering and kind of do what they did before, but this time directing AIs instead of doing it themselves. Some will go into other industries, those that seem further away from being automated for now. And some will try to figure out what we as humans can still do better than AIs. And I think that is an extremely valuable idea to think about.\n\nThere is a chance for another renaissance. Good art has a deeply humanistic quality that I believe AI hasn\u2019t cracked yet, and won\u2019t until we get to AGI, which I\u2019m certain is still relatively far away (I can go into detail why, but that\u2019s probably for another thread). And I\u2019m not just thinking about the kind of art that ends up in galleries and museums. Something you created yourself for a loved one can be a piece of art. A really well-designed product can also be a piece of art. Heck, even a really well-produced TikTok or YouTube video can be a piece of art. We know it, when we experience it. And the really good stuff won\u2019t be just randomly falling out of an AI model, because to make the stuff that makes our hearts sing you need more than just a bunch of algorithms and a lot of processing power. What you need for that, we all have deep within us. \n\nI have to say from my own experience, going through a programming education and working in the tech industry usually doesn\u2019t help in revealing it, and often causes it to be buried instead (because profit, speed, efficiency, metrics, etc.). But if more of us who are technically capable also find their way back to what makes us human, we stand a good chance of figuring out how to coexist with the mediocre domain-specific wannabe-humans that AIs are today. And wouldn\u2019t it be great to have all the mediocre stuff be dealt with, so we can focus on the great?\n\nI\u2019ve also keep a ChatGPT browser window open and experiment with it. I enjoy using it for use cases where I basically let it prompt me with clever questions to push my own creativity. Relying more on the muse than on the oracle. There\u2019ll be a lot of people that will happily jump on the automation use cases and have their dull work taken care of, I think Microsoft is setting that up quite effectively for the business world. But with the right mindset, a healthy amount of skepticism and distrust in the generated \u201cfacts\u201d, and creativity in how to let LLMs play to their and our own strengths, there sure is lots of opportunity.

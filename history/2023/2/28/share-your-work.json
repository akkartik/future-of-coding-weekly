It\u2019s been amazing to see how powerful chat-based interfaces, heralded by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, can be. It\u2019s inspired some to postulate that text is the universal interface, and for others to say that the humble text box is going to be the most important interface component there is.\nThis enthusiasm, understandable though it may be, risks creating the perception that any and all user interfaces can be more or less replaced with a chatbot or text-box based interface.",

I think you touched on some a key point: complex software is complex because it solves complex problems. Chat interfaces are not best suited to do the complex stuff, but they can help us do the simple stuff, that previously may have been difficult due to complicated UI.",

The toolkit features a VSCode extension, visual debugging, full TypeScript support, a rich standard library, and is designed to work in tandem with existing codebases. In essence, Flyde is similar to NodeRED, but geared towards web development.\n\nThis is the first time I am sharing Flyde with a broader community, and I believe feedback from such a talented, inquisitive, and passionate group of people would be invaluable to the project.\n\nCheck out the interactive playground here - <https://www.flyde.dev/playground/>!\n\n I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! Additionally, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated! :blush:",

Slightly related: I have tons of friends who \u201care not gamers\u201d and \u201cnever play games\u201d and you would be surprised how much time they spend on their smartphones matching gems or candy\u2026 I think we need to embrace gaming more, clearly everyone likes it, even if we\u2019re culturally not supposed to after a certain age or whatever.\n\nThe key to enabling people to do more interesting things with computers is to teach them how without them noticing because they\u2019re having too much fun. \nSomehow so far only a dubious part of the Free-to-Play gaming industry has figured that part out but then weaponized it for retention and monetization instead. What if we \u201cweaponized\u201d it for teaching people how to use our tools?",

Slightly related: I have tons of friends who \u201care not gamers\u201d and \u201cnever play games\u201d and you would be surprised how much time they spend on their smartphones matching gems or candy\u2026 I think we need to embrace gaming more, clearly everyone likes it, even if we\u2019re culturally not supposed to after a certain age or whatever."

It is about Vue.js.\n\nI have started to use it because a girl I know, when asked for Vue drawbacks answered me she can't find any. So I decided to give Vue a try. I first started to read its documentation which was very pleasant, there is a french translation, is very clear and reads like a novel. Things are introduced progressively with the right timing.\n\nAnd developping with it can also be very progressive. You don't have to have a global vision of everything to start creating nice things. I even started with an plain old index.html file. When you feel it, you introduce other concepts and everything fit nicely.\n\nSo my experience in learning and creating with Vue is really fun. And I am pretty sure that the fun will continue with the incomming new composition API (I can't wait to start using it :-) ).\n\nAnd all this is not by accident. The community (and first of all Evan You) is very very commited in making the developpers and learners experience very smooth and progressive. They try a lot to remove any accidental complexity.\n\nFor me, Vue is definetly a very inspiring example for building fun and engaging tools.",

Our opinion is that \u201cvisual programming\u201d is more complex and opaque than traditional textual programming (however Storyscript is not traditional at all as the text is complete with data, event, infra and orchestration abstractions that no other language can do by design).

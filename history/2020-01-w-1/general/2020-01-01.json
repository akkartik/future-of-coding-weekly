For me, after seeing thousands of companies say they will reinvent programming with their new tools or techniques I do not know what will work, but I have definitely seen patterns of what *won't work*:\n\n\u2022 *Closed source* - Sure, you can make money and do some great dev stuff (like some .net stuff or VB for the 1990s) but none of these revolutionized development. \n\u2022 *Core language not community owned* - So many people try to \"own\" the language as soon as they smell the money which forces them to make bad or short term decisions\n\u2022 *Thinking short term (ie: 5 years timespan which is typical startup timespan)* - The problem of reinventing programming is a problem that people have tried to solve, thousands, maybe 100s of thousands of times and there is a lot of overconfidence in the area, and just to learn what has been done before could take 5 - 10 years so as not to repeat the mistakes that those who tried it before made\nI guess as the community lead people will look to you for direction on this stuff, to provide roadmaps for categories of problems being solved, and what we have already tried, so that community members can get up to speed on targetting new areas of research instead of just going down the same blind alleys every time. This means setting up conferences, webinars for us all and stuff like that. Keeping the community going can be thankless hard work and is fun while it grows, the real test is when noone else cares :disappointed:\n\nAnyway, to answer your question about where I have been for the past 25 years, don't follow my example, as when I was in my early 20s and 30s I just wasted my time with trivial problems, thinking I would get rich quick from it. I hope the people in this community are nothing like I was when I was younger, and that people here really want to re-invent programming. I did try to join several different programming groups over the last 25 years, but the founders either found a way to sell stuff and then forgot about reinventing programming, or they gave up when they realised that things were going to be too hard and they couldn't find a way to make money, so money always got in the way. And I totally understand where they are coming from, I mean, why should someone waste time solving what may be an unsolvable problem when all their peers are getting rich!\n\nAnyway, as I said, I guess that I am the wrong person to know what will work as there is probably some 12 year old kid sitting somewhere who is inventing the future of programming and will do it in a weekend and surprise us all, and I am just talking as someone who has given up themselves and just copying something from the 1990s (VB6) as I have no better idea myself of how to solve the problem.\n\nAnyway, I guess based on your answer that you have done your homework on how people have tried to solve this problem by studying HCI, Bret Victor, etc, and that you have the right motivations to do this (not money) to have a good chance and making this community work long term, so I definitely support that! :)",

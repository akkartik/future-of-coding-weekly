For example, when confronted with a handful of test failures, order them based on the difficulty of the needed fix.\n\nHow about aesthetics? Hello, 3d visual programming tools with path traced rendering and depth of field.\n\nHow do you avoid pressure? I'm a proponent of injecting our tools with an explicit politics. GNU and GPL is probably the easiest example, but I also see a political motivation behind Urbit and IPFS and federation. It's not inconceivable that one could design an FoC tool that resisted the kinds of usage that breed misery.

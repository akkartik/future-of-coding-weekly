If you think of programming as a linguistic system that is similar to human languages, there are only a few hundred verbs total in the english language, and people only use about 100 of them, and then there are vast numbers of nouns, and then various other parts of speech, and punctuation. Programming languages, the verbs are typically in the syntax of the language, and the nouns are the names we give to all the different variables and functions. One can see in modern systems that the biggest burden of learning is the supporting library API functions. In OSX there are probably 10,000 API's you can call. A vast space that is very difficult to learn.  MS .NET has thousands as well. And since the API's have to be used in proper sequence, there is a massive amount of learning in every framework. You can read a newspaper in Chinese once you learn about 2000 characters, even though the total set is 50,000.  Same with API's; you can build quite a few products with a small set, but knowing which ones to study first is not obvious to a beginner.",

Therefore all Limbo applications are completely portable across all Inferno platforms.\nLimbo's approach to concurrency was inspired by Hoare's communicating sequential processes (CSP), as implemented and amended in Pike's earlier Newsqueak language and Winterbottom's Alef.",

So users \"install\" \"plugins\" by typing a name into the top bar, where it stays until they delete it.\n\u2022 Other programs can connect to Acme via a network protocol which, among other things, lets you control any window given its ID. In particular, if you request a window's event stream, that suppresses almost all default behaviors so that you can redefine what the \"execute\" and \"look\" mouse gestures do, while other windows continue to operate normally.\n\u2022 The network protocol emulates a filesystem interface that for convenience is wrapped by a command-line program whose interface boils down to `9p read [path]` and `9p write [path]`.\nSo given any interface problem, you can attack it in a variety of ways:\n\n\u2022 Make a program that the user invokes, whose input is the current selection and/or whose output overwrites the current selection.\n\u2022 Make a program that controls Acme from afar with the network protocol.\n\u2022 Combination of the first two.\nAnd it's remarkably simple. Like, here's a shell script that you can use as your $EDITOR that opens a file in a new Acme window, adding \"Cancel\" and \"Done\" commands to the UI that dictate the exit code and whether it saves:\n\n```#!/bin/bash\n\nfilename=\"$1\"\n\nwinid=$(echo $(9p read acme/new/ctl) | cut -d ' ' -f 1)\n\n# Open the file\necho name $filename | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\necho get | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\n\n# Add commands to the tag line\necho -n Cancel Done | 9p write acme/$winid/tag\n\n9p read acme/$winid/event 2&gt; /dev/null | while read -r line; do\n\tcmd=$(echo $line | cut -d ' ' -f 5)\n\n\tif [ \"$cmd\" == \"Cancel\" ]; then\n\t\t# Mark the file clean\n\t\techo clean | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\n\n\t\t# Close the window\n\t\techo del | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\n\n\t\texit 1\n\tfi\n\n\tif [ \"$cmd\" == \"Done\" ]; then\n\t\t# Write the file\n\t\techo put | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\n\n\t\t# Close the window\n\t\techo del | 9p write acme/$winid/ctl\n\n\t\texit\n\tfi\ndone```\nThe whole thing might be complex to implement for the editor devs, but there are obvious compromises that would make it easy, and probably still be infinitely better than an API that consists entirely of command-line arguments and SIGINT. :sweat_smile: If it ever doesn't seem worth it, consider threads like this: <https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1178806585289773056>",

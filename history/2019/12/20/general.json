Looks like one must write it in TS/JS.\n\n\"We continued to work on the\u00a0custom editor proposal\u00a0this iteration. (<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77131>) As a reminder, custom editors are webview-based views that can be used in place of VS Code's normal text editor for specific file types. As of VS Code 1.41, Custom editors can now integrate with VS Code's Undo/Redo and Save functionality, which enables many interesting use cases including using them as visual and WYSIWYG editors.\n\nYou can find the current API proposal in\u00a0`vscode.proposed.d.ts` (<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts>) and we have also put together some\u00a0very simple extension samples that demonstrate using custom editors for text and for binary files. (<https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-experimental-webview-editor-extension>)\n\nIf you are interested in custom editors, please share your feedback on the current proposal and let us know if you would be able to implement it.\"",

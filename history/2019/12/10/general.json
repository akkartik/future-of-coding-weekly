In architecture's case Alexander asserts the deeper goal is making places for people to live and thrive in, and that peer approval for its own sake gets in the way of that.\n\nSo then I would assert: a culture of excellence and craftsmanship is distinct from one of obsessive peer approval.",

In architecture's case Alexander asserts the deeper goal is making places for people to live and thrive in, and that peer approval for its own sake gets in the way of that.\n\nSo then I would assert: a culture of excellence and craftsmanship is distinct from one of obsessive peer approval."

Objects are nodes and there is an edge from o1 to o2 if o2 is subscribed to o1 (o1 dispatches events which o2 listens to). Objects supposed to be \u201cProcesses\u201d similar to erlang, objects are some kind of an \u201cAsync Computation\u201d.\n\nHere comes the \u201cnew\u201d stuff:\n\nThere is also a root \u201cStateManager\u201d node which is subscribed to messages contain data about \u201cUPDATING EXISTING IDENTITIES\u201d like \u201cSetGlobalScore &lt;amount&gt;\u201c, any \u201cAsync Computation\u201d (object) which directly depends on changing data must subscribe to this root node.\n\nIf any data gets altered it does not happen immediately but via transactions. The computation which comes up with the new piece of data and wants to share it sends a message to the root \u201cStateManager\u201d node which handles the update.\nIt must check if the data is in use somewhere down in the dependency graph (which I think might be a DAG with the exception of root node): if it is used, the computation might be interrupted (which is more like an exception in my mind) and the whole state might be rolled back to proper state or \u201chandled properly\u201d. If it is not used the state just can be updated: the root emits the message and it propagates down.\n\nThis is just the core idea and quite vague, but the general goal is to add some safety to concurrent programming.\n\nAh, and I\u2019d like to do that everywhere, not just on server side but on client as well! :slightly_smiling_face:",

Objects are nodes and there is an edge from o1 to o2 if o2 is subscribed to o1 (o1 dispatches events which o2 listens to). Objects supposed to be \u201cProcesses\u201d similar to erlang, objects are some kind of an \u201cAsync Computation\u201d.\n\nHere comes the \u201cnew\u201d stuff:\n\nThere is also a root \u201cStateManager\u201d node which is subscribed to messages contain data about \u201cUPDATING EXISTING IDENTITIES\u201d like \u201cSetGlobalScore <amount>\u201c, any \u201cAsync Computation\u201d (object) which directly depends on changing data must subscribe to this root node.\n\nIf any data gets altered it does not happen immediately but via transactions. The computation which comes up with the new piece of data and wants to share it sends a message to the root \u201cStateManager\u201d node which handles the update.\nIt must check if the data is in use somewhere down in the dependency graph (which I think might be a DAG with the exception of root node): if it is used, the computation might be interrupted (which is more like an exception in my mind) and the whole state might be rolled back to proper state or \u201chandled properly\u201d. If it is not used the state just can be updated: the root emits the message and it propagates down.\n\nThis is just the core idea and quite vague, but the general goal is to add some safety to concurrent programming.\n\nAh, and I\u2019d like to do that everywhere, not just on server side but on client as well!

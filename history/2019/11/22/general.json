Productivity is usually defined as efficiency of production (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity>). So it takes you less some to do something. What you do with the time you saved is not dictated here, whether you choose to do more things or go chill.\n\nIn any case, I admit I wasn't attending that closely to the wording, just the dichotomy between scratching your own itch and building something others would use. Now that I think about it, even there I'm not airtight. I'm sure there are people who just want to scratch their own itch. But I think anybody trying to build something for others here is _also_ trying to scratch their own itch.",

Thanks, <@ULM3U6275>, it\u2019s so useful to initiate such a discussion every once in a while because people come and go and directions change over time.\n\nMy main motivation is to build better tools that help us think and communicate those thoughts \u2014 in the _augmenting human intellect_ sense. We have the technology to summon any idea into fluorescent rectangles in front of us (and into the 3D environment around us). There are so many unexplored possibilities with this.\n\nAugmenting intellect is further away from programming than I initially thought, and so I have been looking at disciplines outside our domain concerned with the nature of human thought, e.g. cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, design, or the arts. I want to connect ideas from these disciplines that haven\u2019t been combined before, hoping this will lead to considerably different ideas, and eliminate some of the complexity along the way. It\u2019s a quest to leave the local maxima we\u2019re stuck on behind and make it into the mountains that I believe lie further away.\n\nA problem with that approach is \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 that the more you learn, the more you understand that you don\u2019t understand. At this point I might well be lost, lifted by abstract concepts, drifting away at high altitude, and losing the gravitational pull of a concrete project that brings all these ideas back down to the surface.\n\nNonetheless, computer science and programming is ultimately at the root of building such tools. It\u2019s also still the discipline I\u2018m most familiar with. Anything I might come up with will be based on valuable principles found in computer science, and shaped by many of the inspiring discussions we have here.",

So I believe you'll enjoy these two podcast episodes as much as I did.\n\nFirst up, the fantastic Internet History Podcast devoted an episode to the abridged biography of Claude Shannon, often dubbed the \"Father of Information Theory\", though he certainly was a more interesting character than the title may convey. If you haven't heard of _information theory,_ they do a nice job of hinting at the grandness of the idea in this episode. What I didn't know, though, was just how diverse and charming a character Shannon was. His life and personality don't exactly lend themselves to being biographed (biographized?), but his accomplishments sure do. This episode is a delight, and cements Shannon as a scientific figure of equal stature and historic interest as Feynman and Turing. (And, for that matter, the entire archive of the Internet History Podcast is _golden_. Highly recommended.) <http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2018/05/claude-shannon-father-of-information-theory/>\n\nNext, the podcast Art + Music + Technology interviewed the creator of Max/MSP and Pure Data, Miller Puckette. Folks who know me know that I'm a visual programming ~nutjob~ zealot, so take my word (if necessary) that these projects are seminal works in the field of visual programming. Thanks to this interview, I've now learned that Miller's focus in creating them was in a very different place than I would have imagined. He didn't seem to think much at all about what the visual character of the languages should be, and instead was far more interested in the way that the underlying engine served as a scheduler, taking after Max Matthews (naturally). In addition to the stories of Max and Pure Data, there's a lot of interesting discussion about the early history of computer music, and they even happen to gush about my very favorite textbook (<https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound>). For anyone interested in this particular slice of history, or fond of computer music, I recommend this episode. <https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/podcast-090-miller-puckette>",

It's currently just the easiest way of giving an indication of what information the program is collecting.\n\nI don't know if there's a good way for sure to make a static (non-animated, non-interactive) display of recursive functions scannable, but my first response is that there are many isomorphic ways of showing hierarchies. I had been playing around with the possibilities myself, but someone put up their interpretation on this slack a short while back (if you caught that).\n\nFor most hierarchies I imagine that some of these representations are better than others, and deserve to be experimented with. The best solution may be different for e.g. functions that return a number vs a string vs a struct (numbers are probably the easy case)",

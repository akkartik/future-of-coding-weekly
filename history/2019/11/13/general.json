That is the level on which I see a connection between these domains \u2014 we\u2019re all designers trying to solve problems.\n\nI figure the more specific advice I would like to synthesize from all that is something like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s take a step back and look at what we\u2019re trying to do before we start discussing implementation details.\u201d \n\nThe problem is that this step back takes us uncomfortably far out of our comfort zone of technical expertise into all kinds of weird, hand-wavy, unquantifiable, emotional stuff that\u2019s harder to deal with, but arguably more important.",

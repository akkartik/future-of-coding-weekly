The execution is fun to watch but when everything flickers you can't tell any patterns. What if everything didn't flicker though? Or if you had a way to only show you the executions that match a specific condition?",

So it's nice to alternate between grouping, say, all the executions of a line of code together and then focusing on one suspicious one.  For me the frustrating thing is that I'll imagine the manipulation of the possibility space of executions in my head, then be forced to slowly and crudely convert that into tools that my debugger can understand.",

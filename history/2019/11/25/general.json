Although Englebart was credited with the mouse, it may have been invented by another man who also worked at SRI. He had only one hand, and he invented an input device that looked like a 5 button mouse for typing and moving at the same time. It used chording to achieve all the letters of the alphabet and arrow keys. It takes quite a bit of training to learn 50 different chord patterns."

When I say \u201ccreator\u201d, I don\u2019t mean just me or other developers. I mean everyone on the planet who wants to create things with computers.\n\nI\u2019d guess most people\u2019s common desires would be focused on communication and roughly be described as ways of creating and sharing professional quality interactive documents, which seems worlds apart from the typical FoC demos focused on helping existing developers with  code editor or debugger features.",

        "text": "On the original 128KB Macintosh, there was no lag when you resized a window (by dragging a corner of the window and dragging with the mouse). The animation was: you drag around an outline of the new window boundaries, and the outline tracks your mouse with zero latency or lag. The window contents were redrawn when you released the mouse button. Window resize animation is laggy in all modern window managers. Google 'laggy window resize'. This bothers a lot of people. I tried the Cinnamon window manager on Linux a year or two after it was first released. All of the animations were so laggy that I found it unuseable. That's hopefully fixed now, but maybe today's UI designers are less concerned about laggy interfaces than in the past?",

If it feels laggy like you describe it, it usually means that it\u2019s not even hardware accelerated, which given today\u2019s hardware architectures is kind of expected.\n\nAnd if your platform is the web, then you\u2019re going through an extra stack of however the browser decides to leverage the drawing APIs of the OS.\n\nRearchitecting the graphics stack is one of those areas where we will at least see some interesting progress driven by major platforms, because even with the capable hardware of today it\u2019s still a performance bottleneck. And since the hardware architecture for graphics has changed so dramatically \u2014 from CPU to 2D acceleration to fixed pipeline 3D to dynamic pipeline 3D to fully customizable GPU compute \u2014 all the classic GUI frameworks are practically outdated and hard to effectively adapt to the new world of GPU compute. There\u2019s an opportunity here for platforms to differentiate, which we will unfortunately pay for with fragmentation and graphics standards such as OpenGL becoming obsolete.",

As we approach more direct manipulation and perhaps soon AR overlays to the real world, people will want the virtual UI feel more like the real world \u2014 more physical with kinetic scrolling, \u201cbouncy\u201d animations, visual/audio/haptic feedback, etc.",

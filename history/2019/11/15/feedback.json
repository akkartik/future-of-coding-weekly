        "text": "It's hard to articulate, but I'll try.  :slightly_smiling_face:  For me, Glitch's brand is friendly but the visuals are still just graphical and decorative.  Storyscript feels more illustrative, and the Inkie character is very prominent -- there is a bigger gulf between storybook illustrations and the tech language being used.  For instance, in the book, you jump from a story for 5-year-olds ,to phrases like \"Automated infrastructure configuration, scheduling and management.\"  It's like creating a power tool with Fisher Price aesthetics -- the tool might be amazing, but there is a dissonance there.  Which is different from making a power tool with colorful ergonomic rubber handles and a plain English user manual.  Still friendly but more in line with the target audience.  Just my opinion though.  Hope that helps!",

        "text": "I would like to caution you that Reddit has many inhabitants whose chief delight is crapping all over any proposed changes to the status quo. I recommend before you jump into the swamp that is called Reddit, you watch a small fragment of Carroll Shelby's interview, where he talks about dealing with the bureaucracy inside Ford.  See this video at 29:30 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzq4DeTjZ1A&amp;t=4892s> where he talks about how hard it was to work with Ford. He managed to run the most expensive skunkworks group the auto industry has ever seen, and any creative person has to admire the determination and salesmanship of Shelby. A movie portraying the massive effort by Ford to beat Ferrari opens tomorrow, and i will be there early! Software isn't like cars, but big companies are the same everywhere!",

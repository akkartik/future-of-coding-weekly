The ecosystem kind of dictates where evolution occurs and some aspects seem to be locked down.

However something compelling could start small and slowly grow mindshare and ecosystem over time. That's my hope anyway.",

What I\u2019m calling a lattice is having graphs/sets A,B,C..n in which elements of B can be elements of A but with a transformation applied. Like having a graph A and graph B and node X from B is actually X from A with a transformation applied and different relationships.\n\nSo my lattice structure is a structure containing all those nodes and their relationships in each set (edges) they\u2019re a member of or connected to.  Basically an array of graphs where each node can exist in multiple graphs and have different relationships in each, but it\u2019s always the same node just with a transformation applied for that graph type.  So if you have an X in set D, you can always get relationships of X in set A.",

Are you trying to stay flexible with the data model and/or does it change frequently?\n\nAre your sets (which I understand model the edges in a graph?) small, just modeling relationships between few nodes, but then you deal with a large number of edges?\n\nTheoretically, you could model everything with just binary relationships and take advantage of all the standards graph algorithms, but there are obvious benefits of being able to attach metadata to those edges and factor out some of your data model into such metadata. That would put you into classic graph database territory. Have you considered using a graph database and if so what made you decide against it?\n\nIf your sets for modeling relationships have more than two nodes, do they all have the same number or does it vary? In that case, or maybe in general, a more specific example with perhaps actual data could be enlightening.\n\nAnd I guess the most interesting question is: you asked if somebody here has played with this \u2014 I\u2019m still not sure I did, because I\u2019m still not sure what _this_ is, but\u2026 what other questions do you have?",

E.g. plain text has a very strong correspondence between the display model and storage model (linear, 1-to-1, with some special markers like newlines). Nothing is hidden. It also has a strong correspondence with the input method: keyboard, often 1 key -&gt; 1 char (but not always). If I see a picture of some code anywhere, I know instantly how to recreate it 'precisely'. Can't do that with a vector diagram or a spreadsheet. Also the standard storage operations (read/write) give me exactly the same elements (chars) that correspond directly with ~keys and visual cells. This is the appeal of plain text files.\n\nWhere it falls short is when I seek stronger correspondence to other models represented in the plain text (e.g. AST or some other structure, inter links, etc.). Now there's parsing and file formats involved, a lot of duplication of logic across different readers that interpret the text, false versioniong (text versioning != ast versioning) and so on.",

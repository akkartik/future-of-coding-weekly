And so we keep old stuff around forever, because, hey, it still works and software is difficult to get right so let\u2019s better not touch it and build new stuff on top of it instead.\n\nIt takes courage to change the infrastructure and throw away the old that still works, but overall just introduces complexity we no longer need. It\u2019s a dumb and risky thing to do. You\u2019ll break a lot of things and really piss off a lot of people who\u2019ve gotten used to the old ways of doing things.\n\nYou\u2019d have to be crazy to think that the long-term benefits of reducing that complexity will outweigh the short-term hassle of new bugs, missing features, and annoyed customers.\n\nI\u2019m glad there are still a few people crazy enough to keep doing it.",

This is a great quote from number 2 of 3 <http://www.moserware.com/2008/04/towards-moores-law-software-part-2-of-3.html>:\n&gt;modern software is typically designed by accretion, much like a pyramid. That is, we design by adding around the edges rather than being willing to do a radical top to bottom design like the Empire State Building which was built in about a year with great engineering precision. We keep adding to systems rather than look back at their core assumptions to see if they\u2019re still meeting our needs.\n\nI don\u2019t think the \u201cdimensions\u201d you extracted are creating \u201ca combinatorial explosion of complexity\u201d, and rather see them as an incentive structure pushing us to \u201cadd around the edges\u201d instead of redesign radically:\n\n1. Most projects or organizations are not vertically integrated and don\u2019t control the whole stack, and if you\u2019re dependent on things you don\u2019t control you can\u2019t touch them.\n2. The world hasn\u2019t changed much, but we decided we want to model it more closely and with higher fidelity. That\u2019s a design decision (and a good one) that certainly causes more complexity, but not all of that complexity is essential and choosing to leave existing solutions behind also works higher up the ladder of abstraction \u2014 do we really need all those different image compression algorithms or should we just keep one of them? Which leads nicely into\u2026\n3. Compatibility \u2014 of course we want to still access all the JPEGs and GIFs scattered all over the web, even though we have so much better compression algorithms now. Huge incentive towards keeping the old stuff around. We could attempt to convert everything but that\u2019s obviously more difficult than to just keep a few extra LOCs around to still be able to read JPEGs.\n\nAll that provides pretty strong incentives to not break what already works, avoid the heat of people complaining that legacy will be removed, and so we just keep adding. It's the totally reasonable thing to do. And it\u2019s a viscious cycle as we keep adding more and more things people and other things start to rely on and don\u2019t want to go away.",

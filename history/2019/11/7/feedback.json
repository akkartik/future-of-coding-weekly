I'm thinking about doing a livestream presentation this weekend... I might do some UI mockups to give you an idea of what I'm aiming for (and to get some criticism)\nApologies for the silence, I wanted to get something up quickly... hopefully it makes sense.\nEDIT: video replaced with a version with commentary below",

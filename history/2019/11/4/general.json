It's computationally expensive to drive a 5K display with 24-bit color at 60 Hz, both in and of itself but also because of the work needed to produce graphics that look good on such a display. That work eats up a not-insignificant chunk of your orders of magnitude gain in CPU, I/O, RAM, and GPU. Then consider what it takes to load and store assets (like videos or textures) at that resolution and quality, and there goes a not-insignificant chunk of your HD and network.

Now imagine a scenario, I am using Pandas and some functions from it. If someone declares a bug (it may not always be in issue tracker either, let's say someone just wrote a blog post about it and shared it in HN or something) How do I keep myself updated with that? How do I make sure that before I ship the next version of my code I, at least, looked into the problem and understood what it is and how it may affect me... I did not find any general purpose tool for this. Do you know any?",

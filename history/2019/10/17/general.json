Just as modern OSes may not be ideal, but we can build languages and tools on top of them without exposing the higher level to the details of the lower. To attempt to replace the entire stack seems like it would ensure you\u2019ll be working for decades on the lower parts before you can make any progress on the higher parts.",

        "text": "In languages, once you build a system, you might maintain it for another 20 years. After the creation point, it is updates, refinements, fixes, feature additions. Rarely does one change the language and rewrite from scratch. That almost never gets approved by management. Thus in all statistics of programming language use you will see very old languages persisting. This is why COBOL still shows up in the lists, even though nobody starts a new project in COBOL. I argue that PHP has a lot of inherited code, and that people starting projects today are much less likely to select PHP in 2020 than they did in 2010. So i guess dying is too strong a word. The more accurate description is that the birth rate of PHP projects has been dropping, and that fewer people myself included are selecting it for those somewhat rare cases of a \"from scratch\" project. Python is increasing in birth rate, and many preprocessor languages for JS are also increasing.\n\nThese charts of programming language popularity are more like the census of past design wins.  This keeps the newer entrants down in statistics, making them look risky, when in reality using a crappy tool from decades ago is a guarantee of mediocre productivity, so isn't that a risk also?",

        "text": "Catching up on some of the discussion around adoption and its importance. Diversity of opinion is a good thing! I do think that it's useful to identify what our positions are wrt some axes. For instance, research and discovery are very different than bringing a product to market. On the pure research side you're not thinking of products but are investigating ideas, new perspectives, maybe the 'mathematical structure' of things, hoping to find some powerful ideas that bring deep simplicity, order, strength and/or reliability to various endeavors. Newton wasn't interested in bringing a product to market. I believe this kind of research is valuable in the artificial sciences and design space (~computers) as well. Interestingly Newton spent a bunch of his life chasing alchemy to no avail. Back then it wasn't clear to him or anyone else why this pursuit might be less fruitful than the others. Today this would be obvious to anyone but why it wasn't back then is an interesting question - the deeper education from Newton etc. is probably not whats in the books - the specific formulae etc. - but perhaps the idea that processes can be encoded as forumulae and that these can be discovered, must be consistent, etc - the very medium of science. On the other end of this axis is Henry Ford - definitely many new ideas but in the service of bringing the product. Where would we be with the Model T? Perhaps somewhere in the middle are the Wright brothers. Adoption of product is more of a concern of the product makers. Adoption may also turn out to be valuable to the ideas made by idea seekers (Newton's ideas are very widely adopted), but it's not usually the primary goal because truly new ideas are almost never going to 'fit' in the sea of prevalent ideas.\n\nAnother axis is the time horizon - do you have one and how long is it? This is kind of different from the research/product axis but long time horizons tend to less popular be in the product space. Another axis is the expectation of failure and risk - invest in safer options likely to have mediocre success or wild options likely to fail but an occasional super hit? In the product space, some investors go with this approach - VCs invest in 10 outlandish ideas and hope for one success. In research, I don't know if such funding exists.. I'm not super familiar with the academic space but it seems most grants favor safe and incremental research. It seems that incremental vs radical is another axis..almost all products and ideas have things they change and things they don't.  Anyway, I've rambled quite a bit and no sure where to take this further so I'm just going to leave this at that. Thanks for reading.",

And my opinion is that we know have a family of standards that can be used to ease adoption of new tools/languages/etc., they are the web standards. They provide all the basic stuff (or nearly all?) to build these tools/languages/etc. For me several years ago, there was one critical missing piece in the web landscape: a way to execute fast processings, that's when WebAssembly came in and that was why I was so enthousiast about it (and asm.js before it). It was the missing piece to build new stuff for massive adoption. For me, the next step to \"exit the winter\", is to build something on top of web standards that eases any act of programming, something that permits anyone to propose new ways of programming. A kind of integrated \"FoC development\" environment.",

But i don't see much running on the web that couldn't have been built 20 years ago. And don't think that WebAsm is really that big of a deal; the V8 engine is so blasted clever and fast, that only in the heaviest of applications can you tell the difference. I did some benchmarks a while back, and JS trounced Python for performance. So JS is already quite good as an assembly language which is how i view it. Where WebAsm will have a big impact is breaking the monopoly of JS which is not a particularly good language.",

Another big plus for wasm, is that you can now port legacy code in the web plateform. I did it for scientific algorithms and exotic file format reading (JPEG 2000 for instance).

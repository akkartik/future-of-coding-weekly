Basically \"pre-morteming\" and exploring as much of the space as seems reasonable. We assume that we're wrong about pretty much everything, but that we can still be usefully wrong. To that end, when we start prototyping we acknowledge that we're at our least knowledgeable and plan to throw several versions away. From an engineering stand point, we've found that taking dependencies slows us and whatever we're building down by quite a bit, so we take very few if any. When we build something we try creating an end to end stubbed out demo and then fill it in over time. This allows us to see the system as whole from the very beginning, seeing potential issues at all the levels (UX since we can click through, performance bounds - the stubs will be the fastest it will ever be!,  architectural weirdness, etc)",

        "text": "&gt; I\u2019m talking about the difference between developing the UX, and developing an implementation. Ideally, you can separate the former from the latter..\n\n<@UCGAK10LS> I think this is the core of our disagreements in the past. To get metaphysical about it: when can you decompose a feedback loop and stop treating the systems you build as experiments showing you how to build systems? The answer is \"never\". Or at least, not for our lifetime. Software is still a young field.\n\nPermit me a tangent on waterfall. Hopefully I'll be able to bring it back on topic..\n\nI've been through three levels of understanding of waterfall:\n\nLevel 1: waterfall bad, iteration good.\nLevel 2: even the original paper about waterfall treated it as a strawman: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#Royce's_final_model>\nLevel 3: actually reading the paper (<http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf>) Waitaminnit, it's not just the first model that is waterfall. All the models in the paper are waterfall. Successive refinement of the waterfall model. Waterfall has feedback loops. It's not like water falling at all. More like a circulating fountain.\n\nWhy is the strawman so seductive, why are the feedback loops so easy to forget?\n\n\u2022 Historically there's been incentives to forget them, driven from the top by people without design experience. This is the well-known reason. But I think it's not the only one.\n\u2022 People often learn how to design from an expert in a narrow domain. Maybe your first job was in a compiler shop, and you saw the master crank out compilers. And he pretty much flowed down from requirements gathering to productionization. What you didn't see was the first few compilers he built, when the feedback loops were extremely salient. Careers tend to follow an arc where people build similar things over and over again. And seeing someone later in their career (whom you may admire), it's easy to miss the feedback loops that used to exist but gradually grew vestigial as they over-trained on a single domain.\n\nExtrapolating from this little rant, it's seductive to linearize workflows because the world wants work to get done now, because of pressures from non-designers, and because staying in one domain linearizes with good reason. But when one seeks truth, the feedback loop _always_ exists. Even if it hasn't been used in a while, we dismantle it at our long-term peril. Building the implementation must _always_ be allowed to flow back and trigger a redesign of the UX. If you only learn from the UX step your exploration of the state space is crippled.",

And then in V2 you get to explore even more of the problem by having the \u201cmental map\u201d of the system already, so you can navigate the concepts more easier, merge them, discard them, find new ones.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving into a new city: At first, you\u2019re lost and find a few places (store, barber, bakery, coffee shops) near to cover your basic needs. And sometimes you get lost in the bad part of the city trying to find them. But you notice they\u2019re too far away and you know what you need now (and what part of the city to avoid) so you say screw that, go to explore and notice that you can get a better coffee in the shop 2 streets away and grab bread on the way back (maybe even in the same bakery, maybe not. at least you know it\u2019s there and it\u2019s an option), so now you go there and grab better coffee and bread faster instead of just sticking to V1, :runner: running to the same bakery and coffee shop, spilling coffee all over you and saying \u201clook at me, i\u2019m optimizing!\u201d",

Only a person with the concept of class hierarchies strongly embedded in their skull could possibly use it. That it allows override of a method for a single instance of a variable vs. for the class is such a huge \"gotcha\" he has to mention it in the first tutorial. That you have to warn users from the get-go about a giant pit of bafflement that awaits you is not a good sign. It isn't a question of personal taste, it is a question of ease of learning and use, and to require pre-requisite knowledge as this system does, would make it an instant fail.  There are plenty of smart people who do can handle abstraction, and those people naturally gravitate to LISP, FORTH, Haskell, etc., but when you hand over a large code base written in this system to someone else other than the author, what happens then? What are the chances that the new maintainer can modify and extend that system? This is the big issue companies face every day, when software lasts 20+ years yet people move around every few years, so multiple generations of hand-offs have to execute smoothly, like  a relay race. The relay race is the sport that is being run in our industry, and if i was given a large Self product to maintain (like the editor itself) I wouldn't have a clue as to how to discover how it works.",

        "text": "Another suggestion i have is to make the subset of Intel a bit more regular; in other words, tweak the intel architecture to fix the not-quite orthogonal instruction set. Add memory to memory moves for example (something so wonderful in the Motorola 68000 instruction set), and maybe offer more registers, etc. When Prof. N. Wirth made his Lilith computer, he created a compiler that generated code for the National chip, the Motorola 68k and the intel chip, and his code generator was smallest for the national chip, second best for motorola, and significantly bigger for the intel chip. Interestingly, the market success of the chips was inversely proportional to the easiest chip to program. There is strong evidence that whenever a major choices are made in the computer industry, the one that generates the most billable hours wins. This explains how COBOL beat out far superior languages, and why Java was selected, when it is an awful language.",

        "text": "Hey Parris, some quick first impressions: I find this line to be kind of confusing: \"Old document creators print to paper. This one publishes to phone.\". People are already pretty comfortable with docs being online, so not sure the paper reference works.\n\nMaybe something more like \"Don't just write a doc, tell a story\" (prob not good either, but just a thought).\n\nI like the second paragraph except for \"documents should be the next best thing to a conversation.\". Don't really know what that means.\n\nAnimated GIFs are a nice touch. This looks really slick and I can totally get why someone might use this instead of a Google Doc if they're trying to present or persuade.\n\nI do like the comparison to docs (or maybe slideshows?) over calling it a \"simple app builder\" or \"micro-experience creator\". Lots of people make docs/slideshows, probably no one is thinking \"I want to make a tiny app\".",

The fact that the browsers are controlled by a few entrenched competitors, and due to the baroque hypercomplex and messy design of the web which just keeps tacking on more function like the Winchester Mystery House is not ideal. That these big organizations are immune to suggestions and changes, and bugs don't get fixed promptly, makes we yearn for a simpler less messy underpinnings. The web browsers refuse to let us use UDP packets, except when they deem it okay, and UDP is the way to go for high performance; so much less overhead than TCP.  Google &amp; its co-conspirators have been steering the web browser towards being an operating system bigger than windows. It was a clever strategy and clearly has convinced young people that it is the only way forward. I would prefer a real operating system, that is lean and mean, and not such a mess. CSS is one of the worst layout methodologies ever invented. Like the original US television system which was called NTSC (later nicknamed never twice the same color), i wish i could find an ancronym for CSS that involves mysterious movement of your blocks in baffling ways.",

The shared observation is that 'cross reference represented as strings' is the usual way. This has problems with renaming because we have to find all instances of the same string but only where it references the same entity. Using an `id` for the cross reference and the string name as metadata attached to the id kind of solves this (with tooling support, see unison).\n\nBut the original post is talking about something else too. Specifically if I have a name `setA` and decide to rename A to B, I want the name to automatically become `setB`. Even with id references, this would have to be manual because `setA` is the metadata attached to id1 and `getA` is the metadata attached to `id2` etc. Unless we go a bit further and instead of attaching string metadata to the id, define multiple pieces of metadata to link to the entities `set` and `A`.\n\nThe main requirement is you want only one place where the string `A` exists and it is referenced everywhere else by its id.",

I\u2019m using single page Javascript apps straight from a local file the desktop. Also, being able to choose to drop the same file onto a server where everyone could run it at the click of a link is extremely valuable (consider how many fewer potential users would be willing to download and install an app vs clicking on a link). As for UDP/TCP, all the browsers will be supporting full UDP &amp; TCP sockets and mDNS soon. Take a look at the Chrome or Firefox dev builds. There\u2019s also no need to use either HTML (besides a few lines to boot your JS code with) or CSS (aside from setting style attributes on elements via JS). I\u2019d agree that the DOM is not the layout engine I\u2019d design, but it\u2019s very fast and full featured, and runs everywhere. While it makes may things that used to be easy, more difficult (view management), it also makes many things that used to be very hard, very easy (text layout). The value of the browser\u2019s sandbox is also worth considering. For security reasons, I don\u2019t run any apps that aren\u2019t from highly trusted sources on my trusted laptop anymore, and certainly no code downloaded from github. Maybe that will change once the desktop apps and terminal are fully sandboxed but it\u2019s looking like that will probably come in the form of app signing from big vendors like MS, Google and Apple and I don\u2019t want any of them controlling what apps I can run. The browser is the only escape (for typical users) from the app signing Dystopia.",

SVG shows the same creeping complexity, and who knows how many decades before the browsers implement all of the features. The fact that the feature set is invented and then a decade rolls by while the features are gradually rolled out, and with the freezes in the mobile world where devices are cut off from update streams, it makes for a bizarre situation where 89% of the user base has some key feature.  What is a programmer to do then? It is chaos the way they did it. In the good old Win32 and Quickdraw days of Windows and Apple, you had a fixed specification, and a very solid underpinning.

Can you still run 32bit desktop apps compiled for whatever version of the OS you were using in the 1990s? Many of the OSes I used at the time (Irix, HP/UX, SunOS, NeXTstep) have been discontinued. If you want to reinvent a sandboxed, cross platform environment that\u2019s open, crazy fast, has advanced text rendering, and runs everywhere, that\u2019s cool - it\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see done and I\u2019d definitely take a look at it if/when it\u2019s ready, but until then I\u2019ll use the one that already exists.",

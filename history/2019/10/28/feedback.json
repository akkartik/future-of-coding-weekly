The container-world, infrastructure and devops is a little confusing\u2026after all Alice just wants to prototype an enpoint to upload a video, ML to detect what objects are int, compress it, archive it and return a storage url. Alice discovered Storyscript. She was able to describe her business-logic in simple terms and get the job done in minutes because the tooling helped auto-complete, the services were ready-to-use like libraries and no-plumbing deployments.\n\n(not real code, just concepts to illustrate the idea)\n```\nwhen http server listen method:\"post\" path:\"/upload\" as req\n    video = req.files[\"upload\"]\n    topics = machinebox/videobox detect input:video\n    res = psql insert table:\"videos\" data:{..stuff from above..}\n    video = someOpenSourceCompressor compress video:video\n    storage put content:video dest:\"/{res['uuid']}.mp4\"\n    req write content:\"/{res['uuid']}.mp4\"\n```",

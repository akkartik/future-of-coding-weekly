        "text": "In Hilltop I use blocks (order not important) to define application objects based on predefined object types. Each object definition has predefined typed attributes (including one for the object's value if it's a data-type object) which vary according to object type. The programmer assigns constant values or spreadsheet-like formulas to each attribute. As in a spreadsheet, the formulas are automatically recalculated when the value of any dependency changes. Up to this point it's FRP and declarative.\n\nHowever, each attribute has an optional sub-attribute that can include imperative code for determining the parent attribute's value. Thus, for example, if defining an attribute's value would require a nested formula, the programmer can instead express it imperatively (e.g., with intermediate local variables, If statements, etc.) within the sub-attribute. This code is reactive and is evaluated whenever the value of any of its dependencies changes. Each attribute also has an optional \"watcher\" sub-attribute that can include imperative code that is evaluated whenever the value of the parent attribute changes. This code is not reactive and can do whatever the programmer wants, including changing the values of other attributes of its parent object or of other objects.",

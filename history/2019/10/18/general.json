The first version of unums, now officially known as Type I unum, was introduced in his book The End of Error. Gustafson has since created two newer revisions of the unum format, Type II and Type III, in late 2016. Type III unum is also known as posits and valids; posits present arithmetic for single real values and valids present the interval arithmetic version. This data type can serve as a replacement for IEEE 754 floats for programs which do not depend on specific features of IEEE 754. Details of valids have yet to be officially articulated by Gustafson.",

                "text": "In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.\nFour terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and client. A command object knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command.  The receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation. The receiver then does the work when the execute() method in command is called. An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about the command interface. Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.\nUsing command objects makes it easier to construct general components that need to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing without the need to know the class of the method or the method parameters. Using an invoker object allows bookkeeping about command executions to be conveniently performed, as well as implementing different modes for commands, which are managed by the invoker object, without the need for the client to be aware of the existence of bookkeeping or modes.\nThe central ideas of this design pattern closely mirror the semantics of first-class functions and higher-order functions in functional programming languages.  Specifically, the invoker object is a higher-order function of which the command object is a first-class argument.",

If you start with a flexible runtime, language, editor, user interface, and apps, you will perhaps take on such a general problem that you won't be able to stabilize and thus finish anything. Part of the problem is that operating systems can even be unstable. Look at the chaos that Apple has created by intentionally breaking perfectly operating 32 bit programs in OSX, with the agenda to drive more software sales, but in the meantime wreaking havoc among the user base because they make it a single click to upgrade and it is irreversible. I don't think a small team has the time to build everything. Pharo has done it all themselves, and they have a fabulous IDE, probably the most sophisticated of all extant, but  they spent so much time on itself they have almost no apps to show for it. Objective-C/Swift isn't perfect, but there are millions of apps running okay. One must balance productivity with theory.",

        "text": "Undo/Redo is a fascinating subject. In Adobe Photoshop, they use the ability to undo actions stored in the history palette to great effect, and it is linked with their actions palette, which permits automation to a pretty high degree. however, their undo/redo doesn't affect the user interface, so when you undo a series of actions, you might have to undo whatever changes to the interface were done. In my kids program Flying Colors (available for free download at <http://magicmouse.com|magicmouse.com>),  took reversibility all they way into interface, so that when you undo it also undoes the user interface. This also generated the possibility of having the software self-operate. A few products, very few, can do self-operation, and if you add audio narration, bingo you have a great lesson system. In my case it was about training young people to do bitmap painting. Having products self-operate is a wonderful training method, and the kind of ghost mode where there is an unseen hand moving the cursor and clicking is a fabulous way to teach. It was incredibly difficult to do though, and i haven't done it since. One area where i have continued research is in the issue of duplicating a customer problem in the lab. So often in web apps and interactive graphic software the customers hit a problem, report it, and because it can't be duplicated, it never gets fixed. So this is the problem i am solving in my Beads system, where i record the history, and the users can send that history and replay the bug at the factory. Not easy to to do actually, which is why you don't see it hardly at all.",

        "text": "So .. I read it up to the point I think I get what's going on ..\n\nThings I like:\n\n - use of cellular automata style of algorithm/programming to do AI or goal-seeking in games; looks like they've found an interesting approach where you get what you want entirely through emergent behaviour\n\n - AgentSheets (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSheets>) looks like an interesting product, and I'm confused how I've never heard of it; it has `if(event) then(action)` style rules for agents operating concurrently in a grid and can do 2D and 3D games this way (<https://www.agentsheets.com/img/game3.png>)\n\nThings that leave me with uncomfortable feelings:\n\n - AgentSheets is really, really old (see the website, all its links are broken and it looks pretty bad - <https://www.agentsheets.com/store>)\n\n - it looks to me like they're trying to re-invigorate their product by coming up with this radical-sounding concept of \"anti-objects\", but there's nothing there: just because you use parallel agents to implement a goal-seeking algorithm doesn't mean you've discovered some amazing inverted programming paradigm!\n\nBy the way, the author of this paper, Alexander Repenning, has managed to get millions of dollars in funding for his (related) work from the NSF (<https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0205625> and <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0349663>) which should inspire folk on this Slack!",

                "text": "AgentSheets is a Cyberlearning tool to teach students programming and related information technology skills through game design.\nAgentSheets is supported by a middle and high school curriculum called Scalable Game Design aligned with the ISTE National Educational Technology Standards (NETS). The mission of this project is to reinvent computer science in public schools by motivating &amp; educating all students including women and underrepresented communities to learn about computer science through game design starting at the middle school level. Through this curriculum students build increasingly sophisticated games and, as part of this process, learn about computational concepts at the level of computational thinking that are relevant to game design as well as to computational science. The curriculum is made available through the Scalable Game Design Wiki. Research investigating motivational aspects of computer science education in public schools is currently exploring the introduction of game design in representative regions of the USA including technology hubs, inner city, rural and remote/tribal areas. Previous research has already found that game design with AgentSheets is universally accessible across gender as well as ethnicity and is not limited to students interested in playing video games.The results of the NSF ITEST program supported research investigating motivational and educational aspects of introducing computer science at the middle school level are extremely positive in terms of motivational levels, number of participants and participation of women and underrepresented communities. The participation is extremely high because most middle schools participating in the study have made Scalable Game Design a module that is part of existing required courses (e.g., computer power with keyboarding and power point). Many of the middle schools instruct all of their students in scalable game design reaching in some schools over 900 students per year, per school. Of the well over 1000 students participating in the project in the first semester over 52% were girls. Of the girls 85% enjoyed the scalable game design course and 78% would like to take another game design course.",

        "text": "One other consideration - having implemented undo/redo in the past is - sometimes individual  \"actions\" shouldn't be \"undoable\" rather a batch of operations should be undoable. So simply recording individual operations and describing the reverse operation isn't enough. You end up needing to describe \"undo points\" to fast forward the operation. This is most obviously implemented in text editors. Try writing some words and hitting undo in slack :slightly_smiling_face:. Definitely not an insurmountable problem, but just another thing that makes undo/redo interesting to automate in the general case.",

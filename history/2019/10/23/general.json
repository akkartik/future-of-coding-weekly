        "text": "Backus of FORTRAN fame invented FP at IBM. He was frustrated with the inability to achieve interchangeable parts and compose larger programs. He was convinced that FP would solve this problem, but he died only getting half way to the solution. His Turing award lecture is still interesting, as it points out some of the problems he was trying to solve. Two things he didn't realize is that all programs have a minimal naive implementation, and that really the only difference between languages is convenience of notation, and how the codebases in each language grow in relation to problem complexity. Some grow at n^2, some at n^1.5, and some at n^1.2, and that only in large code bases does the number of dependencies and thus problems grow large enough that exponent can be perceived, and that the asymmetries and imperfections of the underlying hardware is the true source of many problems and issues, and that you have to virtualize a nicer set of hardware to avoid these problems.",

Interestingly, I was never able to convince anyone else to use Modula-2. Everyone said they wanted to stick with C. Even 2:1 improvement was not enough to combat the herd mentality.  If you can double the productivity of employees that cost quite a bit, that should get people's attention, but I don't think the industry is particularly focused on productivity, as that is a management goal, not a worker goal in many cases.",

It seems possible, but a lot of work to find such visionary people who want to give us millions. Of course I'm open to this still...\n\nI've been encouraged to go the for-profit route. Much quicker and easier to raise the money. Of course the catch is that we need to give a return on investment. Luckily, the biggest companies of all time have come from this kind long term research (Ford, Bell, Microsoft, Apple), so it seems reasonable to be able to capture some of the value we create as long as we're operating at longer-term timescales than business as usual. \n\nI'm brainstorming ideas with Alan, and friends and family, all over the map: VC firm, incubator, studio model, single startup, etc.\n\nTo be very clear: my top priority has always been the research to produce better media for humanity. Achieving profitability is just a possibile strategy to fund the research. So I will be very careful to shield researchers that want to do pure research from the commercialization side. \n\nIn short: I am still working on this full time. I'm still optimistic.

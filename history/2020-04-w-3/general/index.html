For bigger changes in project direction or progress the intro can be re-made over time or otherwisd reused the following week.</p>
<p>Sadly there is no more support for cards to skip to a position in a YouTube video, but a custom player could fix that...</p>

If the mic doesn't have any wind protection (eg: your breathing sounds loud), you can put it off to the side of your mouth so that it's out of the direct path of air. Even a bad mic up close will make speech easier to understand than a good mic at a distance.</p>

B) I will expand that page based on our discussion</p>
<p>I personally use Final Cut Pro X to edit videos, and (sometimes) Ableton Live to process audio. I also kill mosquitoes with a flamethrower robot, yes.</p>
<p>iMovie is fine, I used it for years. But what I recommend is just rehearsing your video, and recording every rehearsal as though it were the real thing. It's a two minute video, so you could probably do 5 rehearsals in 15 minutes. By that 5th one, your delivery will be smooth, exciting, and not need editing (unless you're trying to do multiple cameras or something —&nbsp;in that case, yeah, iMovie is great). That's how I did my two minute video — rehearse it with a stopwatch until it was consistently under 2 minutes, and tight enough that I felt good about what to say and do.</p>

With today's state of the art, fixed point is the best choice for dealing with money. Floating point is the best choice for scientific and engineering computing. Rationals are best for symbolic computing. I expect all of them to remain relevant in some context for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Programming languages make some representations easier to use than others, motivated by some specific usage context which is rarely explicitly stated. The Scheme story you cite is a nice example. Prioritizing rationals, as Scheme does, means applying the principle of least surprise with respect to precision. Prioritizing floats, as e.g. Python does, is doing the same with respect to performance. Whichever choice you make <em>will</em> create unpleasant surprises in the other domain sooner or later. It's the job of language tutorials to explain this, but they rarely do because their authors tend to consider their language's choice to be the obviously right one.</p>
<p>More generally, it would be nice if language's engineering tradeoffs were made more explicit. Instead, it's mostly done advertising-style: emphasize the strong points and don't talk about the inevitable disadvantages.</p>
<p>As for fixed-point, all I am saying is that it should be more generally known and better supported, because there are good application domains (such as money) and likely more would be discovered if more people played with it creatively. Example: some people have used it with good results (in terms of performance) in scientific computing, by adapting the scientific models to the available precision. When simulating emergent phenomena, where the low-level details end up being unimportant, this looks like a very promising approach.</p>

Oddly enough though, it's not critical of rationals. It actually advocates for a unification of integers, floats and fixed point numbers under the rational umbrella, with the ability to explicitly choose places where rounding should occur in order to seamlessly opt-in to the more efficient machine representations.

<p>I would suggest that for general purpose financial computation, decimal floating point is a better choice. Eg, see <a href="<http://dec64.com|dec64.com">&lt;http://dec64.com|dec64.com</a>&gt;. That's the format I would choose for a financial spreadsheet app. Fixed point could work if the only operations are addition and subtraction. Even then, arithmetic operations that truncate on overflow would be dangerous for financial computations. But general financial computation also includes interest rate computations, and other related computations, which involve multiplication, division and exponentiation. With fixed point, you would have a much higher risk of overflow or loss of precision for intermediate values in such computations. Decimal floating point fixes these problems.</p>

And decimal floating point, while certainly a promising idea to explore, is unattractive in my corner of the computational universe (scientific computing) as long as it's not implemented in hardware to make it fast.</p>
<p>But I do maintain my suggestion that fixed-point (compiled to integer arithmetic) could find more uses than it has today in scientific computing.</p>

<p>I agree though that the comments were very helpful, mainly in highlighting things I strongly disagree with.</p>
<p>Many of their complaints boil down roughly to "non-programmers will get programming wrong", however they display a stunning arrogance that ignores the fact that programmers are likely to <em>get the actual problem at hand wrong</em>. This apparently isn't an issue.</p>
<p>e.g. this guy <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=mbrodersen">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=mbrodersen</a> - <em>"The real world is complex. The problems software solve in the real world are complex. Economics, sales, politics, personalities, random world events, competition etc. has always and will always be a force pushing software development in non-ideal directions."</em></p>
<p>ie. the genuine reality of the world is likely to interfere with the ideal design of the program!!</p>
<p>The solution is that the person who is genuinely understands the issue (the lawyer, the doctor, the plumber) needs to hand control over to a programmer who knows nothing about the actual problem...</p>
<p>Sometimes programmers forget that their only particular skill is being talented at operating a specific kind of gizmo (a microprocessor). It's like yo-yoists suddenly declared themselves the kings of the world because of their unnatural ability of getting yo-yos to do what they want.</p>
<p>Basically this guy is so close but so far. He sees himself as <em>fundamentally different</em> from a doctor, due to his ability to reason clearly about the world. But this is wrong. The doctor is likely better at reasoning about medicine than him. He is only better at getting a processor to reflect his mental model, because he is skilled in manipulating this gizmo.</p>
<p>The thing they miss is; they are all "end-users" from some perspective. Are they writing x86 directly? No. Then they are merely moulding some environment created by someone else... &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

Ryan Stinnett: </span> <p><p>It was definitely interesting to see how a broader audience like HN reacts to the ideas today. :sweat_smile: Some people there are very comfortable with the current world of computing and don't see a need for change, so they indeed seemed to miss the point, but that's probably okay. To be honest, it's very early days for these malleability ideas, so it seems natural. I am sure many people (esp. on HN) might not be interested when there's no startup to back or quick solution to try out today, and that's okay. For now, I'm mainly hoping to reach anyone interested in experimenting with these ideas or wanting to learn more about those who are doing so.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was some good discussion of finer details in a few of the sub-threads, and I hope it has at least planted a seed for people to think about the ideas over time. Even if people disagree or don't see the point in it today, hopefully they are at least now aware that some people do, and may be more open to such ideas down the road.</p>
<p>Since the HN post appeared, a lot of new people have gotten in touch to share their excitement for these ideas, so overall I'd say the HN post was a positive step even if there are many confused people in the comments. Thanks to everyone here who may have waded in the HN comments with their own perspective. :smile:</p>

I was referring purely to the narrow subjective feeling I got while reading the prose on both pages. The domain name and the headline resonates strongly. When your previous thread rolled by I spent a lot of time trying to pin down what bothered me about it, and to come up with some constructive feedback. I couldn't think of any, so I chose to err on the side of saying nothing. This time around I'm still unable to be as constructive as I would like, sorry about that. I'm still thinking about this, because it matters a lot to me. I <em>want</em> this page to be superior to drive-by comments by people on the internet.</p>
<p>[1] I come from a culture where feedback is often incredibly subtle, and given with lots of circumlocution. In spite of that I'm a pretty unsubtle guy. The result: many times in my life I've failed to heed warnings that (to others) seemed really repeated and increasingly unsubtle. This still happens, even after I moved to the West. As a result, I sometimes accidentally come across as overly harsh without intending to, the way someone may speak overly loudly if they can't hear themselves. At other times, I consciously err on the side of harshing, just to make a contrast really obvious and make sure that others don't end up in the failure modes I've found myself in.</p>

<p>It might be interesting for someone (other than me) to write an “anti-post” on the blog synthesising all the ways it will “definitely never” work... :thinking_face: It would be good to have another voice in the spectrum of perspectives represented.

<p>In <a href="https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1586869277389100?thread_ts=1584718837.435500&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL">https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1586869277389100?thread_ts=1584718837.435500&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL</a> you suggested that you're trying to separate goals from solutions and focus on the former. That's reasonable as a goal for this particular page. (It's also why I find this page unsatisfying.) But it also seems reasonable for it to trigger conversations about the how. That doesn't feel like "missing the point". Isn't that sort of conversation what this page is designed to engender?</p>
<p>Perhaps it will help to triangulate by bringing up my mission: <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>. Not to brag, but we're attacking highly overlapping if not isomorphic problems. By definition I should have addressed any shortcomings I bring up here. It stays high-level, focuses on goals, but also indicates the sorts of trade-offs I'm willing to make. I'd love to receive similar criticism from you about what it's lacking. I should probably update it after my recent efforts writing my paper :sweat_smile: It's quite possible there's a cultural chasm here from me spending too much time on HN. I'd love to understand it better.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would help to drill down into which comments you consider to be missing the point. It might require a private conversation, but it might help make this conversation more concrete. Here, I'll start by summarizing how I view the top-level comments:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858254">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858254</a>: neutral sentiment, acknowledges you're stating an unpopular opinion, responds with another. Seems useful for generating ideas, and -- reading between the lines -- sympathetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859409">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859409</a>: negative sentiment. I would steelman it ("what could this be true of?") as asking a) do you propose limits to extensibility, and b) how do you imagine the system as a whole self-regulating in response to bad changes? That seems useful, even if it's not phrased constructively.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22862292">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22862292</a>: not useful, as <strong>Chris Knott</strong> already pointed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859613">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859613</a>: positive sentiment. Points out the future is already here, maybe just not evenly distributed.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22874983">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22874983</a>: negative sentiment, but suggests that your problem statement needs focus. Seems like useful feedback.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858315">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858315</a>: neutral sentiment, draws a connection with another story on the frontpage to highlight a trade-off. Super useful, to my mind. Engendered a response (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858888">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858888</a>) from someone seemingly ripe to join the movement.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858897">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22858897</a>: neutral sentiment, brings up Plan 9 as prior art. My favorite sub-thread, if my actions are any guide. (Plan 9 isn't a major obsession of mine.)</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22864602">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22864602</a>: negative sentiment, airs a conservation of complexity argument that might be worth addressing head-on. Maybe you need a FAQ?</p>
<p>Other people making positive noises in startlingly diverse choices of words:

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859278">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22859278</a>: Someone being politely skeptical <em>by using Rails as an example</em>. So they're missing the point a bit, thinking about how opinionated you should be <em>after you have achieved malleability</em>. Still kinda interesting to me.</p>
<p>This is just the top-level comments, but at a glance the responses in the major sub-trees seem to mostly be ping-pong rebuttals. So to first approximation half the comments are supportive of the endeavor!</p>
<p>Overall, there's a refreshing lack of "startup mindset" in this thread, particularly if -- like me -- you go in expecting 90% of everything to be crap. Nobody's asking you how you make money, or to to define a market, or to tweak the website. Great example of my thesis that HN is really 2 or 3 mostly-decoupled communities.</p>

<p>In general, the thing I find missing in the <a href="https://malleable.systems">https://malleable.systems</a> mission (and manifestos in general) is any mention of trade-offs. What are we willing to give up to achieve the stated goals? In this case study, malleability is only possible when we control the size and complexity of our software stacks. That might be a common compromise.</p>

Ryan Stinnett: </span> <p><p><strong>Kartik Agaram</strong> Thanks, that's a good point. So far the mission has been focused on the ideals and goals without proscribing solutions, so I wasn't sure if trade-offs would make sense there.</p>
<p>But indeed, there may be common trade-offs that come up across different approaches. Seems like a good subject for a new post, so I filed an issue: <a href="https://github.com/malleable-systems/malleable.systems/issues/13">https://github.com/malleable-systems/malleable.systems/issues/13</a></p>

In my guest blog post (<a href="https://malleable.systems/blog/2020/04/01/the-most-successful-malleable-system-in-history/">https://malleable.systems/blog/2020/04/01/the-most-successful-malleable-system-in-history/</a>) I point out one of them, which is responsibility for the overall system. If you let users mess around with it, you can't then let them sue the original authors if it breaks. And if you let people distribute their own add-ons, that makes three parties among which responsibility must be divided in some way.</p>
<p>Size and complexity are also an issue, but less so if you get away from the assumption of a software <em>stack</em> implying vertical dependencies. Replace this by a network of modular subsystems with reasonably stable APIs, and you can have malleability for the whole system and for each subsystem. Do it recursively and you can perhaps scale to really big and complex stuff (though I am obviously speculating here).</p>
<p>Sure, we have no technology for building systems out of modular subsystems. That remains to be done.</p>

Emacs is a disaster as a user interface. That nerds endure it is testimony to how some people have great memories and enjoy obscure powerful things. 99.9% of humanity rejects Emacs as a reasonable interface for editing. Having worked in word processing and desktop publishing for years, it was obvious from the first version of WordStar, followed by WordStar 2000, DisplayWrite, WordPerfect, then to FrameMaker, Quark xPress, InDesign, and the ubiquitous MS Word, a nice graphical interface trumped the archaic-but-powerful Emacs.  AutoCad which also included LISP inside its system, is a far better example of a successful malleable product that still has a strong company (AutoDesk which has hundreds of employees and a hefty market cap).</p>
<p>Emacs if you tried to sell it would go out of business fast.</p>

While I was aware of the platform, I didn’t know much about it. What I found most interesting is that the limitations, in particular the restriction to 8192 “tokens” that your Lua source code can maximally have, made the person conducting the tutorial optimize the code several times to reduce the number of tokens used. He achieved that mostly through basic refactoring, often using the DRY principle, but also sometimes making the code a little more concise/clever/obscure.</p>
<p>This (artificial) limitation adds a dynamic to development for PICO-8 that I find fascinating. It adds a forcing function for “keeping code lean” which I haven’t seen like this anywhere else. The only other similar thing I can think of is the 140/280 character limit on Twitter. Or maybe demoscene contest categories that limit the code and/or binary sizes to a certain amount of bytes.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other programming environments or IDEs that use soft metrics or hard limits or any other tricks to introduce an awareness for wastefulness to programming?
And how do you feel about that as a means to improve code quality?</p>

<p>In Mu I went the route of having no such limit, and having long names like <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/0671315c1af4707fcab30b11967c88fbaa386bf3/085next-word-or-string.subx#L353">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/0671315c1af4707fcab30b11967c88fbaa386bf3/085next-word-or-string.subx#L353</a> made a huge difference in making the setup feel more ergonomic, so that I wasn't immediately hankering for something better the moment I got it working.</p>
<p>The net effect: someone coming to my project only has to learn 2 notations, unlike in other bootstrapping projects where they have to learn 4 or 5, because the bottom two were built so parsimoniously that they're no fun to program in at all.</p>

Part of it is due to Ashby's law of requisite variety (see Stafford Beer, Platform for Change), but a lot has to do with the compactness of the notation, and the ease with which redundancy is squeezed out. It is a very interesting exercise to study simple projects and boil them down to near the irreducible minimum. In fact, this is how i designed my Beads language; by starting with projects and then designing a notation that would allow for minimal number of words to express that action. The beauty of less code is there is less chance for error, provided you haven't over minimized and obscured logic by blindly pursuing word count as the goal. One must always balance readability with compactness. This was the original mistake of Iverson, which took him a long time to realize, that APL's invented alphabet was obscuring the power of his language (hence his use of ASCII in the J language sequel to APL).</p>

• The language is written using 48 ASCII characters, which enables you to code using a special keyboard layout (if you like) where your fingers never leave home row.
• Identifiers are typically limited to 6 characters. They must fit into 32 bits after being compressed using "Shannon coding".
• Source files are called "blocks" and are limited to 256 "words". An entire block fits on the screen at once, so there is no need for scrolling.
• Function definitions are typically 1 line long. That's not directly enforced, but Forth code becomes increasingly hard to decipher when functions are longer than this.</p>

I think FORTH is probably the most compact language, but also very difficult to read, as effectively you are pushing things into the stack, and you have to memorize how many items on the stack are consumed by each operator. APL had built-in graphing which was wonderful in its day (character graphics based plotting!), so it became more popular. FORTH was targeting embedded systems. If i am not mistaken it was invented for telescope control. FORTH was actually embedded into each Microchannel board; the Microchannel architecture was invented by Data general, and then licensed by IBM for their PC. The beauty of that architecture was that the boards each had some firmware on them, written in FORTH that would negotiate for interrupt vectors and low memory space. They needed a super compact language, so they used FORTH. But the terrible readability has hindered FORTH's general commercial use. I am surprised at how little people use J and FORTH given that they both work very well, and are super powerful. If you are doing a one man project, you might not care about readability. Perhaps it is all the hoopla around functional programming that makes people ignore these very interesting languages.</p>

Computer languages are languages, just ones with very few nouns. If you carefully examine the task of learning a new language, you have a few dozen numeric primitives, perhaps 500 total verbs, of which you only use about 50 regularly. But then you hit the nouns, and there a million of those. Human languages have a name for all sorts of parts of things. A computer is such a simple universe there aren't even 50 nouns. So they seem very different, but really it is just the giant pile of nouns that makes human languages seem so complex. But the complexity level of grammar of computer languages is pretty comparable.</p>
<p>His point that various build and make tools often require a different tool or language is not always true. It just happens that language designers are sometimes shortsighted, and also because of OS idiosyncrasies which require customization for packaging. I find some of the build tools to be so hard to use that i don't even bother learning the language.</p>

But I never considered these terms themselves as <em>analogies</em> when applied to programming. Extremely useful article.</p>
<p>But calling programming languages 'tools', while useful once I think of it as an analogy, still leaves a lot on the table IMO. A tool as we usually conceive of it typically has only a few degrees of freedom. Think of your hands, or a screwdriver, or MS paint. But the state space of a programming language is much more vast and non-linear. The mental image I find most useful is of a language as a little universe being born, budding off from ours through a tiny wormhole that can only transmit information at 48 baud.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a neologism. I like conlangs and esolangs. Perhaps we need <em>proglangs</em>, parasitic constructs off natural language with many attributes of tools but nonetheless vast state spaces more akin to languages.</p>

Modern programming languages feel like I must, in part, produce completed structures of code, rather than brainstorming and exploring. Programming inevitably alternates the code from working to not working to working to not working, etc, and we would benefit from languages that were more explicit about facilitating the ‘not working’ states. From my rough intuition, the ‘not working’ states of code outweigh ‘working’ state in terms of time and importance (e.g. compiler for code that is exploratory but does not work).</p>
<p>REPL, for a very simple idea, is praised so much (and so widely used) perhaps for this reason — it facilitates intermediate steps. This would be a rough parallel to how Bret Victor mentions that “ideas are important” to him. I looked at &lt;<a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/four-years-of-studying-exploratory-programming-4656586b1d3b|Exploratory">https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/four-years-of-studying-exploratory-programming-4656586b1d3b|Exploratory</a> Programming&gt;, but it doesn’t seem to capture exactly what I want (i.e. goes a bit too shallow).</p>

I imagine there is a gradient from detailed/machine code implementation - to abstract/natural language description; Imagine if you're able to start out each "block" at any level, and then iteratively add details as needed. Combine that with an auto-complete that works more like google search than word completion, but context sensitive, and somewhat semi-structured such that some computer-processable "meaning" may be derived (declarative probably preferred); Then, the "comments"/most abstract/top-most (as in top-down) "notes" would "always" be "in sync" with the implementation, and you'd have something "useful" at each level of detail)</p>

(which is tangential, but related to what <strong>Don Abrams</strong> said about starting "sloppy" and adding guarantees). as far as what you're building <strong>Leonard Pauli</strong>, it seems like the real utility there is in the comment blocks that you get "for free" as a result of building them first. a point of contention though: how do you make sure that when you change the code at a lower level, that it will "line up" with the comment you wrote before? what happens when your mental model for how it <em><em>should</em></em> behave or be built differs substantially from how you actually end up implementing it? the nice part about using types as your guide, as Don alluded to, is that they are an intrinsic part of the code: if the types don't line up with the values you're passing in, your program won't compile. how can we make the same guarantees for natural language?</p>

<p>For the "comments" to be in sync with the implementation, they have to be connected somehow. Ideally, the "comments" would be isomorphic to the actual implementation. One end, natural language/plain text, the other end, binary machine code. Typescript types allows you to get closer to NL, though I want to get even closer. My current plan is to sacrifice NL free-form, thus gaining realistic ability for structured representation of the "comment", that then "becomes" the implementation. Instead of trying to solve "complete NLP",  the autosuggestion will (hypothesis) push you into using a parsable format. Thus, you'll get 80% of the way with 5% of the effort. As with types, the words you use will either have to be explained further, or linked to existing concepts, until you reach the base types. As with "io-monads are not necessary in a complete system", this might maybe only work fully where everything is declarative. The outline is really a graph structure, where one node may exist in multiple places, and be aliased to fit the context/DSL. If you change the meaning of a concept, you'll see all its names, and possibly choose to change them (the name or the connection).</p>
<p>Though this is not a sufficiently complete solution... A theory is that the "next big FoC paradigm shift" would require quite a lot of parts coming together and contributing natively to each other. Many ideas might be "interesting" on their own, but in isolation, they provide less value then the current status quo. I've often found it hard to communicate certain aspects of the system, as you would have to imagine all parts being there at once. (saw a quote by Tim Berners-Lee, stating that he had to mask the web as a documentation system and build it for real, as stakeholders couldn't fantom to imagine it filled with all the sites we have today, and thereby not recognizing its potential). Though when all the components connect, you get something "many magnitudes better" than what we have today. Well, that's the idea at least :)</p>

That is normally done in a systems language like C, C++, Rust, Zig, so you can have performance. Look at Python, Ruby, Javascript, Perl, etc, that's how it's done. I picked C++ because I'm familiar with it, but also because there are a lot of specialized 3D graphics libraries I'd like to link with that are in C++, and not replicated in other languages. Rust would be my second choice because there are an increasing number of interesting Rust crates for programming GPUs. C++ and Rust are both horrible, complex languages, with slow compilers, that kill your productivity. Any alternative language that I could switch to would be better in some ways, but would lock me into an ecosystem that would make some things I want to do extremely difficult or impossible. What if I want to build a small and performant native app, or a small and performance WebAssembly module, containing my language? Will Haskell or Python or Racket or O'Caml or Pharo get me there? I feel there are no good choices of implementation language.</p>
<p>My language is dynamically typed because I prefer dynamic typing, it's easier to implement a dynamically typed language, and it's the best choice for exploratory and live programming. Curv is a language for making art, not for <em>deploying applications</em> on a <em>server</em>, so why do my users need static typing?</p>

<p>Textual coding (including SQL) requires this in at least two ways: mentally simulating a parser/lexer, and then mentally simulating the process described.</p>
<p>Mentally simulating something complex and invisible (playing chess, coding, math, chemistry, counting cards, ...) probably can't ever be done without extensive training. I think because of that, it will only be done by those with extremely strong need for it (i.e. high enough to justify hundreds of hours acquiring a new skill), or who are lucky enough to find the effort of training rewarding in itself instead of a cost.</p>
<p>Also it's a core thesis of mine that simply making the invisible, mentally-simulated stuff <em>visible</em> could massively lower the barrier and admit many more people into the field!</p>

<p>You can <em>tap and click</em> stuff today, so people's narratives about <em>typing</em> stuff has changed. At the time SQL was invented, a non-programmer would be what—someone who could use DOS but not Fortran or BASIC? If Phyllis Reisner ran the same human-factors tests today, SQL would probably appear to be less usable than it was in the '70s. Actually, that'd be a fun study. :laughing:</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I browsed a few beginner SQL tutorials just now. Five didn't say anything how easy it is to get started with SQL, or imply in any way that SQL was designed with human factors in mind. The sixth does point out that, hey, there's a million database software packages out there now and most have custom commands, but all you gotta learn is six commands (with a list of their simple, evocative names) and you'll know pretty much everything you need to know about SQL. Now that's a tutorial for non-programmers about a language designed for non-programmers.</p>

<p>I think humanity already overshares too often. I think we put a lot of half-baked thoughts in the public space, and the world consequently suffers from "information overload" where we can't figure out what to pay attention to / what is valuable. It happens in news media, social media, blog posts, and this Slack. In this Slack, the main instigator of discourse seems to be the posting of links (65% of posts in the last 3 weeks). How much time are we wasting on distracting tidbits of public information?</p>
<p>So when I'm drafting ideas for a blog, I'm encountering this worry that my half-baked thoughts will just be further distractions. Notice that Bret Victor, who many of us here appreciate, doesn't have a blog. He doesn't share ideas until he's sure he has a valuable, coherent message, and sometimes he spends years preparing his next message. Perhaps this is the best way to communicate.</p>
<p>Of course, many of us want to share ideas so that we can, in effect, "work together" on the future of programming. I think collaboration is valuable, but perhaps public communication is not the best way to do this. In a private setting, discourse is informal, and half-baked ideas can be happily lost to history. When people work together privately, they can filter through ideas rapidly, and only publish information when they have a battle-tested, coherent message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, private collaboration is still most effective in person, because humanity doesn't yet have the technology to digitize the experience that physical workplaces provide. Perhaps an in-person communication style is nevertheless one we should aspire to, to prevent the dissemination of half-baked ideas. I don't know how best to achieve this, but <strong><code>#two-minute-week</code></strong> seems compatible, at least.</p>
<p>It's also unfortunate that our societal structure isn't conducive to the formation of altruistic "working groups", which would be the ideal collaborative environment, but that's a whole separate discussion which we've touched on before.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

There's a tension between seeking serendipity and adding noise. The good news, as I see it: it's not a very important dilemma. We don't have to optimize it just right. It's enough to satisfice. If people don't complain, you aren't oversharing, and so you shouldn't worry about oversharing.</p>
<p>The effects of noise are cumulative. Each new piece adds a little bit of downside. But the potential upside is very great if you find a Lennon to your McCartney. So it's better to err on the side of oversharing, IMO.</p>
<p>Sharing is naturally regulating: if you don't get much response you'll naturally slow down. At least if you don't start watching artificial metrics like analytics or reshares or whatever. I just focus on what makes the good conversations happen, where I end up with some extra clarity inside my head.</p>

Our brains are for the most part evolved for communities of 150 people. We should share often with those closest to us. Do we really need to have 1,500 people sharing with all of us at the same time to evolve? Probably not.</p>
<p> There might be some incredibly insightful ones for whom a half-baked idea is a gold mine for everyone else, but I suspect that many of those often spent time alone with their thoughts beforehand (eg. Look how long Nassim Nicholas taleb procrastinated before publishing).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the reality of the human brain aligns much better with elder-led learning of many indigenous groups. Too bad we worked so systematically at destroying many of those societies. Gladly, all is not lost and they are resilient......</p>
<p>Those are my half-baked ideas at least.</p>

<p>Write blog posts, publish them to your site, but don't make any inbound links to them. They're secret.</p>
<p>Continue working on them as your thinking evolves. Never stop.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you'll find yourself in a conversation where one of these posts would make a relevant contribution. Share the link with just those people. They'll only see that one post.</p>

Anytime I tag a new note with 'publish' it gets a URL on my site without putting it on the frontpage. Most of these notes are poorly formatted, but I often react to conversations by using my site search for things I've written in the past. Every once in a while I'll clean one up to share it more deliberately. (Though that hasn't happened very often. Mostly I just rephrase for the new context, because what I had before is never <em>quite</em> right for this new conversation.) Still good as an exo-brain, though.</p>
<p>Bumping back to the original topic, 99% of the time the goal is just to write more, because it clarifies one's thinking. If a blog helps you do that, do a blog. Otherwise try something else. Thinking about 'information overload' and 'polluting the commons' is counter-productive in that situation. Focus first on being the best 'you' you can be. The world has recovered from meteor impacts, and the universe has regular supernovas. They can deal with a few blog posts.</p>

• We definitely <em>can</em> overshare without causing complaint. There are a lot of blog posts out there, and I'm sure most readers will just close the page if they find a post uninsightful or misinformed; they won't send an email to the author. I strongly disagree with the proposal to do whatever I feel is best for myself without concern for others. That's a very egocentric worldview. Wasting people's time is a real and pervasive problem.
• I agree it is sensible to share more with those you are closest to. That's a good replacement for social media posts. I already excel at this because I don't post any social media content whatsoever :stuck_out_tongue:! Unfortunately it doesn't work well for niche technical topics, since your family and housemates probably aren't interested in the future of programming, and even software engineering colleagues may not be. Unfortunately, I don't have many people to talk to IRL about my research interests.
• Yes, maybe what I really want is not a blog, but an externalisation of my beliefs and ideas that I can share with people when appropriate. I've been liking the way Andy Matuschak does this. Roam Research seems to be the new hotness for linked notes, though I'd rather not build my knowledge base on a proprietary platform.</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Framing the agile movement as a response to trauma — I suspect many other things in our industry could be framed that way?</li><li>Composition naturally leads to iterative process — not sure if that “naturally” there is justified, but certainly an observation to ponder.</li><li>How collaboration is such an important part of the agile approach although “programming itself is a quasi-solipsistic activity. A programmer requires, strictly speaking, no more collaboration than does a novelist or painter.”</li><li>“[T]he presence of a feature can only indicate to a user if a goal is possible, behaviour will determine how painful it will be to achieve it.” and “[Behavior] blurs the line between “fixing bugs” and “building features”, and coalesces the two into a unitary process of “sculpting behaviour”.</li><li>“Even in a world after programmers, there will still be the work of figuring out—albeit no longer in code—just what you want to tell the computer to do for you—how you want it to behave. There are still a lot of decisions to make aside from what framework you write it in, or whether you use NoSQL, or how you lay out the source tree. If you eliminate the decisions that involve getting the artifact to work at all, the remaining decisions are going to involve whether it works better one way than another. Most of these decisions are going to be the result of trial and error, and a sizable chunk of those are going to involve feedback from users.”
And he touched a few other things we talked about here before.</li></ol></p> </div>

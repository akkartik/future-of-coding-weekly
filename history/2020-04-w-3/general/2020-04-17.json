Ideally, the \"comments\" would be isomorphic to the actual implementation. One end, natural language/plain text, the other end, binary machine code. Typescript types allows you to get closer to NL, though I want to get even closer. My current plan is to sacrifice NL free-form, thus gaining realistic ability for structured representation of the \"comment\", that then \"becomes\" the implementation. Instead of trying to solve \"complete NLP\",  the autosuggestion will (hypothesis) push you into using a parsable format. Thus, you'll get 80% of the way with 5% of the effort. As with types, the words you use will either have to be explained further, or linked to existing concepts, until you reach the base types. As with \"io-monads are not necessary in a complete system\", this might maybe only work fully where everything is declarative. The outline is really a graph structure, where one node may exist in multiple places, and be aliased to fit the context/DSL. If you change the meaning of a concept, you'll see all its names, and possibly choose to change them (the name or the connection).\n\nThough this is not a sufficiently complete solution... A theory is that the \"next big FoC paradigm shift\" would require quite a lot of parts coming together and contributing natively to each other. Many ideas might be \"interesting\" on their own, but in isolation, they provide less value then the current status quo. I've often found it hard to communicate certain aspects of the system, as you would have to imagine all parts being there at once. (saw a quote by Tim Berners-Lee, stating that he had to mask the web as a documentation system and build it for real, as stakeholders couldn't fantom to imagine it filled with all the sites we have today, and thereby not recognizing its potential). Though when all the components connect, you get something \"many magnitudes better\" than what we have today. Well, that's the idea at least :)",

Ideally, the \"comments\" would be isomorphic to the actual implementation. One end, natural language/plain text, the other end, binary machine code. Typescript types allows you to get closer to NL, though I want to get even closer. My current plan is to sacrifice NL free-form, thus gaining realistic ability for structured representation of the \"comment\", that then \"becomes\" the implementation. Instead of trying to solve \"complete NLP\",  the autosuggestion will (hypothesis) push you into using a parsable format. Thus, you'll get 80% of the way with 5% of the effort. As with types, the words you use will either have to be explained further, or linked to existing concepts, until you reach the base types. As with \"io-monads are not necessary in a complete system\", this might maybe only work fully where everything is declarative. The outline is really a graph structure, where one node may exist in multiple places, and be aliased to fit the context/DSL. If you change the meaning of a concept, you'll see all its names, and possibly choose to change them (the name or the connection).\n"

A theory is that the \"next big FoC paradigm shift\" would require quite a lot of parts coming together and contributing natively to each other. Many ideas might be \"interesting\" on their own, but in isolation, they provide less value then the current status quo. I've often found it hard to communicate certain aspects of the system, as you would have to imagine all parts being there at once. (saw a quote by Tim Berners-Lee, stating that he had to mask the web as a documentation system and build it for real, as stakeholders couldn't fantom to imagine it filled with all the sites we have today, and thereby not recognizing its potential). Though when all the components connect, you get something \"many magnitudes better\" than what we have today. Well, that's the idea at least :)"

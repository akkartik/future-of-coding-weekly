It is an external representation of ideas and thought.\n\n_Writing_ is one medium, but it took ages after its inception to achieve the power and ubiquity for humans. Successively evolved, refined and morphed via other overlapping mediums such as _algebra, (bar|line) graphs_, _architecture diagrams_. The printing press had a big impact on the ubiquity of writing.\n\nDynamic screens are another kind of medium - there is overlap with _writing_ (so we got a lot of stuff for free) but _hypermedia_ and other interactive interfaces let us represent and navigate ideas in new ways, which we couldn't do with dead tree books.\n\nDynamicland is seeking a live 3D physical medium. We don't quite know how to represent ideas in this medium _yet._ I think this is what they are exploring. The programming part is a means to an end - to animate the physical - but the deeper question is how do you represent, interact with and understand ideas and thoughts in such a medium? What kinds of ideas are even better represented in such a medium? Might also take ages to discover, refine and evolve to something ubiquitous, but in this sense I think they are doing something nobody else is doing.",

Things like text, images, and movies are content. Things like printing, converting to MP3, and translating to Japanese are operations. When you wish to complete a particular task you select the set of content you wish to operate upon and then issue the appropriate command to invoke the operation. If you have text selected, you can do things like move, copy, make italics, or send as e-mail. If you have an image selected, you can change its contrast, remove scratches, or send it as e-mail. You can use any command on any content at anytime. If you try to motion blur text, the system is smart enough to realize that it should be treating the text as an image and does the conversion automatically. Thus, we have done away with the idea of \"applications\" and replaced them with a more powerful and more humane paradigm.\n\nUBIQUITY: Explain that a littl...",

Things like text, images, and movies are content. Things like printing, converting to MP3, and translating to Japanese are operations. When you wish to complete a particular task you select the set of content you wish to operate upon and then issue the appropriate command to invoke the operation. If you have text selected, you can do things like move, copy, make italics, or send as e-mail. If you have an image selected, you can change its contrast, remove scratches, or send it as e-mail. You can use any command on any content at anytime.

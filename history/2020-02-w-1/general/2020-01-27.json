Thus, Stiegler\u2019s main line of argument suggests that as we can experience a melody multiple times, and our experience of that melody changes depending on the multitude of times we experience it, we must therefore have a form of technical retention, or \u2018tertiary retention\u2019 in which the repeatability of a temporal object becomes possible. Our primary retention is also therefore dependant on both the secondary and tertiary forms of retention. By Matt Bluemink.",

Well maybe not so much unseen as deliberately ignored.\nI think the key takeaway here is that technology is /persistent/ and has long-ranging effects. As a creator, are you willing to take responsibility for your creation? Perhaps the more important question is whether you can even do so\u2014is it a task even capable by humans? I wonder how much of the general disregard for these questions comes out of a sense of despair?\nBut eh, I didn't really expect to be discussing philosophy here to be perfectly honest",

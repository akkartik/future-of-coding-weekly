Screen densities vary from 100 to 500 dpi nowadays, so you can't ever use pixels and expect it to look nice across all devices.\n\nIn this video i show a tool i just built that lets you visualize your output as if it was on different devices. This tool is in the Beads SDK example set called \"cycler\". The way it works is interesting; you compile two programs at once; one is the \"monitor\" program that gets control of the screen, and then runs a slave program inside a smaller window. Javascript has iFrames and so on, but doesn't really have the concept of a dpi inside a window, which is a huge hindrance. Anyway i hope you find it interesting.\u00a0\u00a0<https://youtu.be/AoACdQSSsZM>",

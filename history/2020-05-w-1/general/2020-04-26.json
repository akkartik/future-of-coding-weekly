Ideologies all over. One ideology has been freely expressed above: \"the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities and oppression across society\". I reacted calling it \"group identity politics\". Others have reacted too. But those reactions got deleted, and only those reactions.\n\nI will elaborate: I don't even buy into the premise of \"we need more women in here\". Maybe I am a woman. Maybe my female partner is enjoying the conversations in here every week. Maybe my daughter is currently learning how to program and is inspired by many posts and links posted here. Or maybe not. The point being: I wish to not correlate people's identity with their gender, or to single them out in that way (\"look it's a woman!\"). I'm not saying gender or ethnicity or religion are not important identity holders. I'm saying that they may or may not be. People have various paths in life.\n\nMy ideology is that I wish to build a path toward a situation where everyone, indeed, can afford to say what I've had just said. I.e. that I can express myself without defensively adjusting for a thousand prejudices due to my gender or ethn.. wait never mind.\n\nAnd so we get to the topic of style and tacit rules. A community has clearly a dominant style. For example, some communities like banter, others have little taste for it. There are certainly ways of talking and writing that pervade this community. The very concept of an asynchronous board is not obvious to everyone (nor is Slack). If someone (who happens to be a woman, but not necessarily) stumbles across this forum and feels uncomfortable to contribute, why would you attribute that to the community being all male? Or worse even, as has been said in another thread: a community of \"comfortable white men\". Why do you feel the need to bring gender into this? Or race?\n\nI am sure that intentions here are good. I even believe that the author of the phrase \"the lack of gender diversity reflects structural inequalities\" means well. I question however the tactics used to act on those good intentions. The first tactic is to define groups of people by gender and such, which to me utterly defeats the whole point. The second tactic is to silence whomever expresses opposition to the first tactic.",
